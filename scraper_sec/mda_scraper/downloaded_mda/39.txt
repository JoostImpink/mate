On April 19, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement under which Oracle Corporation (Oracle) will acquire all of our common stock, through a merger, for $9.50 per share in cash and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle. On July 16, 2009, our stockholders adopted the merger agreement at a special meeting of the stockholders. On August 20, 2009, the United States Department of Justice notified us that it had approved the proposed acquisition by Oracle. The completion of the transaction is subject to receiving certain foreign regulatory approvals and various other closing conditions. Summary of Results Our fiscal year 2009 results were negatively affected by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. This has adversely impacted our business across nearly all geographies and industries. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2008: Total revenue decreased by 31%. Server Product revenue decreased by approximately $623 million, or 36%. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points. We recorded restructuring charges of $64 million as compared to $104 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We canceled development of our next generation microprocessor and recorded vendor claims and impairments of, intellectual property of approximately $30 million associated with the cancellation. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: Total revenue decreased by $2.4 billion, or 18%. Research and development expenses decreased by $186 million, or 10%. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $494 million, or 12.5% We impaired approximately $1.4 billion of our goodwill. We recorded restructuring charges of $395 million as compared to $263 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and other income (expense) decreased by $163 million, or 101% We ended the fiscal year 2009 with a cash and marketable debt securities balance of $3.1 billion. Over the last year we introduced enhanced M Series enterprise servers, open storage products and the next generation of mid range disk arrays. 27 Table of Contents Revenues For the fiscal year ended June 30 (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Systems Server Products $ 4,819 $ (1,445 ) (23.1)% $ 6,264 $ (191 ) (3.0)% $ 6,455 Storage Products 1,885 (469 ) (19.9)% 2,354 38 1.6% 2,316 Systems revenue $ 6,704 $ (1,914 ) (22.2)% $ 8,618 $ (153 ) (1.7)% $ 8,771 Services Support Services $ 3,648 $ (375 ) (9.3)% $ 4,023 $ 61 1.5% $ 3,962 Professional and Educational Services 1,097 (142 ) (11.5)% 1,239 99 8.7% 1,140 Services revenue $ 4,745 $ (517 ) (9.8)% $ 5,262 $ 160 3.1% $ 5,102 Total revenues $ 11,449 $ (2,431 ) (17.5)% $ 13,880 $ 7 0.1% $ 13,873 Systems Revenue Our Systems products provide customers with business solutions requiring advanced server and storage capabilities. Our enterprise Server Products include our high end and midrange SPARC&reg; based servers which provide solutions for virtualization and consolidating, web tier environments, large scale enterprise applications and related software. Our volume Server Products offer flexible low cost enterprise, midrange and entry level solutions that include our Chip Multi Threading (CMT) servers and x64 based servers. Our enterprise, midrange and entry level Storage Products include disk and tape products that provide solutions for mainframe and open systems environments. Our disk Storage Products include entry level, midrange and enterprise arrays and associated connectivity devices such as host bus adapters. Our tape Storage Products include entry level, midrange and enterprise libraries and virtual storage solutions. Server Products Revenue The decrease in our Server Products revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the economic downturn as projects were scaled back, delayed or canceled in addition to increased competition and aggressive discounting, and the weakness in demand for high end servers. The decrease spanned most of our Server product categories. In the fourth quarter, revenue was negatively impacted by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. Revenue was also unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of Olympus Product Line (OPL) data center and midrange servers and our CMT volume servers. The decrease in Server Products revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to the change to certain distributor programs under which we are no longer able to meet certain criteria for revenue recognition at the time of sale to our distributors. There was a corresponding increase in deferred products revenue over the same time period. In addition, we experienced decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based server products, decreased sales of our x64 based rack server products and decreased sales of our mid range server products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based server products were due to reduced customer demand as products are near their end of life (EOL). Decreased sales of our x64 based rack server products were primarily due to the delayed introduction of AMD quad core based products. Decreased sales of our mid range server products were primarily due to a partial shift to volume products and due to certain of our products were near their EOL. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our CMT volume server products, increased sales of our blade server products and increased sales of our OPL server products. Increased sales of our CMT volume server products and our blade server products were primarily the result of continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Storage Products Revenue The decrease in Storage Products revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily attributable to the economic downturn as projects were scaled back, delayed or canceled and increased competition and aggressive discounting with respect to our tape and enterprise disc array products. In the fourth quarter, revenue was also negatively impacted by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. In addition, as disk products frequently attach to our servers, declines in Server revenue contributed to decline in our disk products. Revenue was also unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our open storage products. 28 Table of Contents The increase in Storage Products revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of enterprise and mid range disk products, and increased sales of tape media. Increased sales of enterprise disk products were due to product introductions, including enterprise disk model. Increased sales of mid range disk products were due to improved functionality and scalability in addition to sales initiatives. Increased sales of our tape media products were due to the increase in our installed base. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of our enterprise and OEM tape drive products and Virtual Storage Manager (VSM) mainframe products. Decreased sales of our enterprise and OEM tape drive products were primarily due to delayed product introductions. Decreased sales of our VSM mainframe products were primarily due to the competitive and declining mainframe market. Services Revenue Services revenue consists of Support Services revenue and Professional and Educational Services revenue. Support Services Revenue Support Services consists of Support Services and Managed Services. Support Services offer customers technical support, software and firmware updates, online tools, product repair and maintenance and preventive services for system, storage and software products. Managed Services include on site and remote monitoring and management for the components of their information technology (IT) infrastructure, including operating systems, third party and custom applications, databases, networks, security, storage and the web. Support Services revenue consists primarily of maintenance contract revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual period and represented approximately 77%, 76%, and 78% of Services revenue in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in Support Services revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the cumulative effect of decreases in our installed Server Product base over the last six quarters, increased discounting and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to see pricing pressure on renewals and the impact of the shift in sales of our Server Products from enterprise to volume servers. The increase in Support Services revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of our Managed Services and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange movements. Increased sales of our Managed Services were primarily the result of increased demand for remote and managed site offerings and the shift to single supplier multi vendor support models which are displacing traditional maintenance support service models. We experienced pricing pressure on maintenance contracts sold or renewed primarily due to customers choosing lower cost solutions. Professional and Educational Services Revenue Professional Services enable customers to reduce costs and complexity, improve operational efficiency and build or transform the IT infrastructure. Professional Services include IT assessments, architectural services, implementation services, and consolidation and migration services. Educational Services include training and certification for individuals and teams. The decrease in Professional and Educational Services revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the delay, cancellation or scaling back of projects. In addition, discretionary training was reduced due to the unfavorable economic environment. Professional and Educational Services revenues were also negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rates. The increase in Professional and Educational Services revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased Professional Services revenue as a result of increased demand for High Performance Computing (HPC), data management and specialized identity management projects. Additionally, we experienced an increased demand for consolidation and virtualization services which use software applications to divide one physical server into multiple isolated environments creating greater efficiency in the use of servers. Increases in Educational Services revenue were primarily due to continued Solaris adoption and the related training needs. 29 Table of Contents Net Revenues by Geographic Area For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 North America $ 4,559 $ (1,038 ) (18.5)% $ 5,597 $ (367 ) (6.2)% $ 5,964 Percentage of net revenues 39.8 % (0.5) pts 40.3 % (2.7) pts 43.0 % International revenues: Europe $ 3,763 $ (868 ) (18.7)% $ 4,631 $ 182 (4.1)% $ 4,449 Percentage of net revenues 32.9 % (0.5) pts 33.4 % 1.3 pts 32.1 % Emerging Markets Region $ 1,794 $ (175 ) (8.9)% $ 1,969 $ 239 13.80% $ 1,730 Percentage of net revenues 15.7 % 1.5 pts 14.2 % 1.7 pts 12.5 % APAC (Asia, Australia and New Zealand) $ 1,333 $ (350 ) (20.8)% $ 1,683 $ (47 ) (2.7)% $ 1,730 Percentage of net revenues 11.6 % (0.5) pts 12.1 % (0.4) pts 12.5 % Total international revenues $ 6,890 $ (1,393 ) (16.8)% $ 8,283 $ 374 4.7% $ 7,909 Percentage of net revenues 60.2 % 0.3 pts 59.7 % 3.3 pts 57.0 % Total net revenues $ 11,449 $ (2,431 ) (17.5)% $ 13,880 $ 7 0.1% $ 13,873 United States (U.S.) (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 U.S. $ 4,253 $ (945 ) (18.2 )% $ 5,198 $ (443 ) (7.9 )% $ 5,641 The decrease in U.S. revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of our enterprise and volume Server Products, enterprise storage arrays and our Services. Enterprise and volume Server Product sales decreased primarily due to weak economic conditions, which caused our customers to scale back or defer projects. We continue to see a decline in investments for IT in our financial services, communications and government server markets. Enterprise storage array and tape sales declined due to competitive pressures which led to aggressive discounting. These declines were offset by increased sales of our open storage products and our CMT servers. The decrease in Services sales was primarily attributable to the declining Systems installed base, delays in service contract renewals, increased discounting due to competitive pressures and a reduction in consolidation and customized products. The decrease in U.S. net revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to decreased sales of our Server and Storage Products, decreased sales of our Services and a change to certain distributor programs under which we are no longer able to meet certain criteria for revenue recognition at the time of sale in to our distributors. Decreased sales of Server Products were due to decreased sales of our traditional SPARC volume products, data center and mid range enterprise server products and x64 based rack Server Products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based Server Products were primarily due to reduced customer demand as products are near their EOL. Decreased sales of our data center and mid range Server Products were due to a partial shift to volume products and certain products nearing their EOL. Decreased sales of our x64 based rack Server Products were primarily due to the delayed introduction of AMD quad core based products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our CMT based SPARC volume Server Products and blade Server Products. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products and our blade Server Products were the result of continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Decreased sales of our Storage Products were due to decreased sales of our enterprise and entry level disk products and decreased sales of our enterprise tape drive products due to weak demand in the first half of fiscal 2008 for these products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of tape media due to increases in our installed base. We experienced decreased Services revenue primarily due to a decrease in Support Services revenue. Decreased Support Services revenue was due to an increasingly competitive environment, particularly within the telecommunications sector due to recent acquisition and consolidation activity within the sector and increased competitive pressures. International Revenues The following table sets forth net revenues in geographic markets contributing significantly to changes in international net revenues during the last three fiscal years ended June 30: (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Emerging Markets(1) $ 1,794 $ (175 ) (8.9 )% $ 1,969 $ 239 13.8 % $ 1,730 Central and North EMEA(CNE)(2) $ 1,038 $ (211 ) (16.9 )% $ 1,249 $ 146 13.2 % $ 1,103 United Kingdom $ 818 $ (337 ) (29.2 )% $ 1,155 $ 25 2.2 % $ 1,130 Germany $ 872 $ (121 ) (12.2 )% $ 993 $ 0.0 % $ 993 30 Table of Contents (1) Emerging Markets consists primarily of China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and United Arab Emirates (UAE). (2) CNE consists primarily of Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Revenues in fiscal 2007 have been adjusted to reflect a change in the composition of countries that make up CNE. Emerging Markets The decrease in revenue for most of the countries in our Emerging Markets during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of certain enterprise and volume servers and our tape and storage array products. These declines were primarily a result of the reduction in customer projects due to the economic downturn. Revenue was also affected by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were offset by increased sales of our Support and Professional Services due to infrastructure buildouts and the demand for traditional Support Services. The increase in revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased sales of our volume server and mid range disc Systems products. Increased Systems sales were due to the developing infrastructure programs and strong demand from our telecommunications customers. The increase in Systems sales was partially offset by decreased sales of our enterprise server products. Our Services sales increased due to increased Professional Services sales primarily as a result of increased demand for consolidation, installation and customization projects. CNE CNE revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, across all parts of our business due to the challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Decreased sales of enterprise and volume servers and Storage Products were primarily due to the delay or cancellation of projects by customers. Services revenue decreased primarily due to discounting and customers delaying renewals. The increase in CNE revenues during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of Systems Products, increased sales of Services and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales of Systems Products were due to increased sales of data center Server Products, increased sales of CMT based SPARC Server Products and increased sales of our blade Server Products. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products and our blade Server Products were the result of the continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Increased Services sales were due to increased Support Services sales. Increased Support Services sales were due to increased demand from the government and telecommunications sectors. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of traditional volume SPARC based Server Products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based Server Products were primarily due to reduced customer demand as products were near their EOL. United Kingdom (U.K.) The decrease in U.K. revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was across all parts of our business. A majority of our customers in the U.K. are in the telecommunications and financial services sectors which are both declining. Our customers in these sectors continue to be cautious, resulting in longer sales cycles or cancellations. In addition, there has been a shift in demand to lower end Systems products. Our Services performance was adversely affected by a number of contract losses and renegotiations. Services revenue is also being impacted by a shift in product mix from high end to x86 which has a much lower attach rate. Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.K. revenues during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased sales of CMT volume server products, increased sales of data center Server Products and the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products were the result of the continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were primarily attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of traditional volume SPARC based server products due to reduced customer demand as products were near their EOL. We experienced declines in Support Services sales due to decreased spending on services within the governmental and financial services sectors. Germany The decrease in Germany revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of enterprise servers, Services and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Enterprise server revenue decreased primarily due to project delays or cancellations due to the economic downturn. Support Services revenue decreased due to discounting and erosion of the installed base. Decreases in enterprise servers and Support Services revenue were partially offset by increased sales of our enterprise libraries and increased Professional Service sales. 31 Table of Contents Revenues in Germany were unchanged during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Increased Systems product sales and the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange rates were offset by decreased Services revenue. Increased Systems product sales were a result of increased sales of our data center enterprise server products and our Netra Server Products. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were primarily attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. Increased Netra Server Product sales were primarily due to increased demand within the telecommunications sector. Decreased Services sales were primarily due to decreased Professional Services sales due to decreased demand from the financial services sector.

Many of these factors influence, or are interrelated with, other factors. As a result, it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually. Accordingly, the following quantification of the reasons for the change in the Systems products gross margin percentage is an estimate only. During fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, Systems products gross margin decreased approximately seven percentage points primarily due to: pricing and discounting actions of six percentage points and unfavorable changes in sales mix and volume of five percentage points. Unfavorable margin impacts associated with pricing and discounting were due to increased competitive pressure. Unfavorable volume and mix variances were primarily due to decreased sales of our higher end Systems products as a percentage of total sales. These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by a four percentage point increase associated with material cost savings. Systems products gross margin increased by approximately one percentage point during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Decreasing material costs and our supply chain restructuring efforts combined to increase gross margin by approximately ten percentage points. Offsetting this increase was the impact of pricing and discounting actions by approximately nine percentage points. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin percentage is influenced by numerous factors including services mix, pricing, geographic mix, foreign currency exchange rates and third party costs. Many of these factors influence, or are interrelated with, other factors. As a result, it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually. Accordingly, the following quantification of the reasons for the change in the Services gross margin percentage is an estimate only. During fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, Services gross margin decreased by approximately two percentage points. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a four percentage point decrease associated with unfavorable changes in sales mix and volume. This decrease was partially offset by a two percentage point increase due to improved delivery efficiencies and lower services costs. Services gross margin increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Cost savings associated with better utilization rates and decreased costs associated with compensation benefited gross margin by approximately three percentage points. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable changes in services mix of approximately one percentage point. 32 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Research and development $ 1,648 $ (186 ) (10.1)% $ 1,834 $ (174 ) (8.7)% $ 2,008 Percentage of net revenues 14.4 % 1.2 pts 13.2 % (1.3) pts 14.5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,461 $ (494 ) (12.5)% $ 3,955 $ 104 2.7% $ 3,851 Percentage of net revenues 30.2 % 1.7 pts 28.5 % 0.7 pts 27.8 % Restructuring charges $ 395 $ 132 50.2% $ 263 $ 166 171.1% $ 97 Percentage of net revenues 3.5 % 1.6 pts 1.9 % 1.2 pts 0.7 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets $ 1,460 $ 1,460 $ $ $ Percentage of net revenues 12.8 % 12.8pts Purchased in process research and development $ 3 $ (28 ) $ 31 $ 31 $ Percentage of net revenues (0.2) pts 0.2 % 0.2 pts Total operating expenses $ 6,967 $ 884 14.5% $ 6,083 $ 127 2.1% $ 5,956 *N/M Not meaningful Research and Development Expenses (R&D Expenses) R&D expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the decreases in performance based compensation, lower compensation and benefits resulting from head count reductions, and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. Lower prototype expenses also contributed to the decline. During fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, R&D expenses decreased primarily due to decrease in compensation and benefit expenses, including incentive based compensation, a decrease in prototype expenses associated with a new product introductions and decreases in depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses from outside service providers. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A Expenses) SG&A expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits from head count reductions, decreases in performance based compensation and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase to SG&A expenses during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, increased marketing expenses and increased expenses associated with outside services and travel. The increase in SG&A was primarily a result of increased compensation and benefit expenses associated with additional sales employees added to our high sales growth regions and additional employees from our recent acquisitions, increased marketing expenses associated with equipment placement programs, increased service provider expenses and increased travel expenses associated with our multi year internal systems implementation effort. We experienced increased facilities and occupancy expense and expenses related to a legal settlement. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses. We are continuing to focus our efforts on achieving additional operating efficiencies by reviewing and improving upon our existing business processes and cost structure. Restructuring and Related Impairment of Long lived Assets During fiscal 2009, we continued implementation of previous restructuring plans in addition to the implementation of our phase IX plan in order to reduce our cost structure, which included reductions of our workforce. As a result of this and prior restructurings, restructuring and related impairment of long lived assets charges for fiscal 2009, was $395 million. For further details, refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill During our fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2008, based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment, our operating results, and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. Because we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and was reasonably estimable, we recorded a $1,445 million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We finalized our analysis in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and concluded that no further adjustment was necessary. See Item 1A, Risk Factors above for more details. 33 Table of Contents Gain on Equity Investments, Net For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Gain on equity investments, net $ 8 $ (24 ) (75 )% $ 32 $ 26 433.3% $ 6 In fiscal 2009, we recognized a net gain of $8 million on the sale of our equity investments, which primarily consisted of approximately $6 million in gains on the sale of certain equity securities in public companies, $5 million in gains on the sale of certain private investments offset by $5 million of impairments on certain public and private investments. In fiscal 2008, our gain on equity investments, net, of $32 million, was comprised of approximately $13 million in gains on the sale of certain marketable equity investments in publicly held companies and $19 million in gains from private company investments. As of June 30, 2009, our equity investment portfolio of $42 million consisted of $11 million in marketable equity securities, $18 million in equity investments in privately held companies and $13 million in investments in venture capital funds and joint ventures. The ongoing valuation of our investment portfolio may be subject to fluctuations based on whether we participate in additional investment activity or as a result of the occurrence of events outside of our control. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Interest and other income (expense), net $ (2 ) $ (163 ) (101.2 ) $ 161 $ (53 ) (24.8 ) $ 214 The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net, during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in fiscal 2009. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded impairment charges associated with our debt investment securities of approximately $28 million. The decrease in interest income (expense), net, during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in fiscal 2008 resulting from the use of $2.76 billion of our cash for our stock repurchase program and the use of $797 million of cash to purchase MySQL in fiscal 2008. Our interest income and expense are sensitive primarily to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which are predominantly short term fixed income instruments. To better match the interest rate characteristics of our investment portfolio and our issued fixed rate unsecured senior debt securities, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions so that the interest associated with these debt securities effectively becomes variable. Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 51 $ (156 ) $ 207 $ 97 $ 110 During fiscal 2009, we recorded a tax expense of $51 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax expense is net of a tax benefit of $13 million resulting from the enactment of legislation which provided that taxpayers may elect to forego bonus depreciation on certain additions of qualified eligible property and, in turn, claim a refundable credit for a portion of its unused alternative minimum tax and research credits. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which was signed by the President of the United States on July 30, 2008, applied to certain property additions from April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 was enacted which extended the period for eligible property additions for another year through December 31, 2009. 34 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we recorded a tax expense of $207 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax expense included a reduction in the U.S. valuation allowance that is credited to other balance sheet accounts and therefore did not benefit the income tax expense. The tax provision for fiscal 2008 was also impacted by a reduction in foreign tax expense as a result of repaying intercompany loans of certain international subsidiaries that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax expense of $110 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The foreign tax expense is net of a benefit of $14 million recorded for the reduction in accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of restructuring of certain European subsidiaries as well as a benefit of $13 million due to a tax law change in Germany. The U.S. tax benefit reflects a benefit of $54 million primarily relating to the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service income tax audit for fiscal 2001 and 2002, and a benefit associated with adjusting estimated amounts to actual liabilities resulting from the filing of the fiscal year 2006 U.S. tax return. This U.S. benefit was offset by the utilization of acquisition net operating losses, increases to various tax reserves, and foreign withholding taxes. U.S. income taxes have been provided on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2009, there are no earnings that are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside of the U.S. However, we may elect to permanently invest in operations outside of the U.S. in the future. We currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain overseas deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Likewise, the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowance. We have also provided adequate amounts for other anticipated tax audit adjustments in the U.S., state and foreign tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. If our estimate of the federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense could result. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the liabilities would be reversed, and any related tax benefits would be recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. 35 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2009, our investment portfolio was valued at approximately $3.1 billion which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, fixed income assets, and short and long term investments. Exclusive of cash equivalents, approximately 88% of all our investments in debt instrument securities are rated AA/AA2 or better by Standard & Poors (S&P) or Moodys. As of June 30, 2009, approximately 83% of our portfolio excluding cash had a remaining maturity of less than one year. Approximately 16% of our investment portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, contains asset backed securities. Approximately 77% of our investments in asset backed securities were rated AAA by S&P or Moodys, and the expected weighted average remaining maturity was greater than two years. Our portfolio has the following categories of asset backed securities as of June 30, 2009 (dollars in millions): Asset Backed Securities Mortgages $ 98 Autos $ 50 Credit Cards $ 36 Large Equipment $ 2 Other Asset Backed Securities $ 9 $ 195 As of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,876 $ (396 ) $ 2,272 $ (1,348 ) $ 3,620 Marketable debt securities 1,185 147 1,038 (1,284 ) 2,322 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $ 3,061 $ (249 ) $ 3,310 $ (2,632 ) $ 5,942 Percentage of total assets 27.3 % (4.2) pts 23.1 % (14.4) pts 37.5 % Cash provided by operating activities $ 457 $ (872 ) $ 1,329 $ 371 $ 958 Cash used in investing activities (707 ) (641 ) (66 ) 1,011 (1,077 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (95 ) 2,516 (2,611 ) (2,781 ) 170 Effects of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (51 ) (51 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (396 ) $ 952 $ (1,348 ) $ (1,399 ) $ 51 Changes in Cash Flow During fiscal 2009, our cash from operating activities was significantly impacted by the following: A net loss of $2,234 million, which was offset by non cash charges of approximately $2,421 million, which primarily included goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,460 million, depreciation and amortization of $474 million, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $296 million and stock based compensation of $192 million; and Changes in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $270 million was primarily due to collections of accounts receivable of $757 million, and the change in prepaids and other assets of $140 million, which was partially offset by payments of accounts payable and other liabilities of $740 million. During fiscal 2009, our cash used in investing activities of $707 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable debt securities of $1,813 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment, net, of $466 million. This use of cash was partially offset by cash provided by the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities of $1,638 million. Cash used in financing activities of $95 million was primarily attributable to $130 million paid to purchase stock under our stock repurchase programs. During fiscal 2008, our cash from operating activities was significantly impacted by the following: Net income of $403 million included non cash charges of approximately $965 million, which primarily included depreciation and amortization of $476 million, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $310 million and stock based compensation of $214 million; and 36 Table of Contents Decreases in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $39 million was primarily due to increases in prepaid and other assets and inventory of $313 million which were partially offset by increases in other liabilities of $298 million. During fiscal 2008, our cash used in investing activities of $66 million was primarily attributable to our purchase of MySQL and other acquisitions, net of cash received of $923 million, purchases of marketable debt securities of $1,333 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $520 million. This use of cash was predominantly offset by cash provided by the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities of $2,608 million. Our cash used in financing activities of $2,611 million was primarily attributable to $2,764 million paid to purchase stock under our stock repurchase program.

(2) DOS measures the number of days it takes, based on a 90 day average, to sell our inventory. (3) DPO measures the number of days it takes, based on a 90 day average, to pay the balances of our accounts payable. The cash conversion cycle is the duration between the purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash for the sale of our Systems products and Services and is a quarterly metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets. The cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of DSO added to DOS, reduced by DPO. Inventory turns is annualized and represents the number of times product inventory is replenished during the year. At the end of fiscal 2009, DSO negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by five days primarily due to the timing of billings. DOS negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by four days primarily due to an increase in deferred cost of goods sold associated with non standard deals and fair value issues. For fiscal 2008, DOS negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by six days primarily due to an increase in inventory associated with the introduction of certain distributor programs for which the criteria for revenue recognition could not be satisfied and due to an increase in inventory designed to ensure product availability and rapid delivery to customers. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2009 (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Payments Duein LessThan 1 Year PaymentsDue in1 3 Years PaymentsDue in4 5 Years PaymentsDue After5 Years Senior Notes $ 550 $ 550 $ $ $ Convertible Notes 700 350 350 Non cancelable operating leases 678 179 250 129 120 Purchasing and manufacturing commitments(1) 444 444 IT outsourced services commitments(2) 18 18 Interest on Senior and Convertible Notes 27 10 10 6 1 Defined benefit plans 145 10 25 24 86 Asset retirement obligations(3) 36 5 22 3 6 Other obligations(4) Total contractual obligations $ 2,598 $ 1,216 $ 657 $ 512 $ 213 (1) We estimate that these contractual obligations are due in less than one year from June 30, 2009. This amount does not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities. 37 Table of Contents (2) Represents certain outsourced services where we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled prior to a contractual minimum term. (3) These obligations arise from leased facilities where we have contractual commitments to remove leasehold improvements and return the property to a specified condition when the lease terminates. (4) Other obligations include uncertain tax positions. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments of $94 million of uncertain tax positions and therefore these have been excluded from the table. Capital Commitments Restructuring activities As part of the restructuring announced in November 2008, we expect to incur between $500 to $600 million in severance and benefit costs. These costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2010. For further details, refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Restricted Cash As part of our service based sales arrangement involving a governmental institution in Mexico, we were required to maintain certain guarantee bonds. The total amount of the bonds was approximately $41 million. In fiscal 2008, a security deposit of $41 million was returned to us and replaced with a cash secured letter of credit of $21 million. The deposit of $21 million used to secure the letter of credit is classified as Other non current assets, net, in our June 30, 2009, Consolidated Balance Sheet. Purchase Obligations We utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by us. We also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers. We acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead times and or commercially standard lead times for the particular part or product. Financing Arrangements In August 1999, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior debt securities in four tranches (the Senior Notes) of which $550 million was due on August 15, 2009 and bears interest at 7.65%. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually. We may redeem all or any part of the Senior Notes at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition to an amount determined by a quotation agent, representing the present value of the remaining scheduled payments. The Senior Notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. In addition, we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the Senior Notes so that the interest associated with the Senior Notes effectively becomes variable. Our Board of Directors has authorized our management to repurchase Senior Note debt from time to time in partial or in full branches based on availability of cash and market conditions. As of June 30, 2009, we have not repurchased any debt. On August 17, 2009, we repaid the last tranche of our Senior Notes plus accrued interest. In addition, the related interest rate swap was settled. In January 2007, we issued $350 million principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012 and $350 million principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2014 (the Convertible Notes), to KKR PEI Solar Holdings, I, Ltd., KKR PEI Solar Holdings, II, Ltd. and Citibank, N.A. in a private placement. Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Notes is convertible into 34.6619 shares of our common stock (or a total of approximately 24 million shares), which is the equivalent of $28.85 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the Convertible Notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we have the option to purchase up to 24 million shares of our common stock at a price of $28.85 per share and we sold warrants to the same financial institution whereby they have the option to purchase up to 24 million shares of our common stock. The separate note hedge and warrant transactions were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the Convertible Notes. 38 Table of Contents Acquisitions An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. Typically, the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the United States within six to twelve months after the closing of the acquisition. Integration activities for international operations, particularly in Europe, generally take longer. Stock Repurchases In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to $3 billion of our outstanding common stock. Under the authorization, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009, all funds authorized under the May 2007 authorization had been utilized. In July 2008, our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding common stock. Under the authorization, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price. During fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2008, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares, or $130 million of our common stock, under these authorizations. There were no shares repurchased in the second, third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 under the July 2008 repurchase authorization and as of June 30, 2009, approximately $906 million remained available under this repurchase authorization. See Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Contractual Obligations We maintain a program of insurance with third party insurers for certain property, casualty and other risks. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self insurance basis. We retain risk with regard to (i) certain loss events, such as California earthquakes and the indemnification or defense payments we, as a company, may make to or on behalf of our directors and officers as a result of obligations under applicable agreements, our by laws and applicable law, (ii) potential liabilities under a number of health and welfare insurance plans that we sponsor for our employees and (iii) other potential liabilities that are not insured. The types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions. We reserve for loss accruals, which are primarily calculated using actuarial methods. These loss accruals include amounts for actual claims, claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported. Actual experience, including claim frequency and severity as well as inflation, could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded. In the normal course of business, we may enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnification obligations have not been material. 39 Table of Contents In September 2004, private plaintiffs known as relators filed an action against us on behalf of the government of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Arkansas alleging that certain rebates, discounts and other payments or benefits provided by us to our resellers and technology integrators constitute kickbacks in violation of the federal Anti Kickback Act, because such benefits allegedly should have been disclosed to and or passed on to the government. That action was filed under seal, and the complaint was not unsealed until April 2007. Later in fiscal 2005, the General Services Administration (GSA) began auditing our records under the agreements it had with us at that time. The GSAs auditors alleged that we failed to provide agreed upon discounts in accordance with the contracts price reduction clauses and further alleged that certain pricing disclosures made by us to the GSA were substantially incomplete, false or misleading, resulting in defective pricing. In April 2007, the United States Department of Justice filed a complaint intervening in the lawsuit in Arkansas described above. The governments complaint includes claims related to both the kickback claims in the relators original complaint and other claims related to the GSA audit described above, including claims under the federal False Claims Act, breach of contract, and other related claims. The governments complaint does not identify the amount of damages it claims or intends to claim. The parties continue to discuss the nature of the governments current and potential claims on our GSA and other government sales. If this matter proceeds to trial, possible sanctions include an award of damages, including treble damages, fines, penalties and other sanctions, up to and including suspension or debarment from sales to the federal government. Although we are interested in pursuing an amicable resolution, we intend to present a vigorous factual and legal defense throughout the course of these proceedings. As required by SFAS 5, we accrue for contingencies when we believe that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss. We have made an assessment of the probability of incurring any such losses and such amounts are reflected in other non current obligations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and it is difficult to predict the outcome of particular matters with reasonable certainty and, therefore, the actual amount of any loss may prove to be larger or smaller than the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2009, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Capital Resources and Financial Condition Our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents in subsidiaries for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. At June 30, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.9 billion. Our remaining investments of $1.2 billion were held in marketable debt securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities position at June 30, 2009, was approximately $3.1 billion. We believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe our level of financial resources is a significant competitive factor in our industry and we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate growth and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 describes the significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, however, to the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and our actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the accounting policies discussed below reflect our more significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Accounting Effective July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS, No. 157 to account for our financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. 40 Table of Contents The fair value of our Level 1 financial assets is based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security and generally include cash, money market funds and United States Treasury securities with quoted prices in active markets. Determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. The fair value of our Level 2 financial assets is based on observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and generally include United States government agency debt securities, corporate notes/bonds, certificates of deposit and derivative instruments. These Level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to Level 1 instruments which include determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced, determining whether the market is active and determining which model derived valuations are to be used when calculating fair value. We perform our analysis with the assistance of pricing services. We do not hold any Level 3 instruments. In accordance with SFAS 159 which we adopted on July 1, 2008, we evaluated our existing eligible financial assets and liabilities and elected not to adopt the fair value option for any eligible items during fiscal 2009. However, because the SFAS 159 election is based on an instrument by instrument election at the time we first recognize an eligible item or enter into an eligible firm commitment, we may decide to exercise the option on new items when business reasons support doing so in the future. Impairment of Debt Investment Securities We review our investment portfolio regularly for impairment. A security is considered impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell it prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is deemed to have occurred. In these instances, the OTTI loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell an impaired debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell it prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we assess whether we will recover securitys amortized cost basis. If we conclude we will not, a credit loss exists and the securitys impairment is separated into: The amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings as OTTI, and The amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. As part of this assessment we consider various characteristics of each security including, but not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area; the payment structure of the debt security; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and related outlook or status; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. The relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security, as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment. Should the actual credit loss related impairment differ from our estimates, the amount of the investment impairment charges and their timing could be materially impacted. Impairment of Marketable and Non Marketable Equity Securities We periodically review our marketable equity securities, as well as our non marketable equity securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other than temporary. Factors we consider to make such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, as well as the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period. If any impairment is considered other than temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Goodwill and Other Long Lived Assets We account for business acquisitions in accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141) and the subsequent accounting for goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) and SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis is performed at one level below the operating segment level as defined in SFAS 142. 41 Table of Contents In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates based on a combination of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on future discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units, such as property and equipment and accounts receivable, are not held by those reporting units but by functional departments (for example, our Global Sales and Services organization and Worldwide Operations organization). Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit, then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. Only after this process is completed is the amount of any goodwill impairment determined. SFAS 144 is the authoritative standard on the accounting for the impairment of other long lived assets. In accordance with SFAS 144 and our internal accounting policy, we perform tests for impairment of intangible long lived assets semi annually and whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may be impaired. This analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset (or assets) are less than the carrying value of the asset (or assets) we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value. We typically estimate the fair value of long lived assets using the income approach. As of June 30, 2009, we had a goodwill balance of $1,743 million. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analysis, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their estimated remaining useful lives. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and property and equipment to the balance sheet for those reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization (adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash, marketable debt securities and debt) on the date we perform the analysis. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our $1,743 million goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) A decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of either of our software or services reporting units below their carrying values; (2) Further weakening of the global economy, continued weakness in the network computing industry, or failure of Sun to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cashflows and reduce the estimated discounted cashflow value of our reporting units. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result from these factors, or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other long lived assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business, changes in market conditions or a longer term decline in the quoted market price of our stock will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods. Failure to achieve our forecasted operating results, due to further weakness in the economic environment or other factors, could result in impairment of a significant amount of our long lived intangible or tangible assets. As of June 30, 2009, we had $269 million of long lived intangible assets and $1,616 million of long lived tangible assets. Revenue Recognition As discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we enter into agreements to sell hardware, software, services and multiple deliverable arrangements that include combinations of products and or services. Additionally, while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including: (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables if there are multiple deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements. In addition, our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collectibility is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition. 42 Table of Contents We recognize revenue as work progresses on fixed price Professional Services contracts when we can reliably evaluate progress to completion. We perform periodic analysis of these contracts in order to determine if the applicable estimates regarding total revenue, total cost and the extent of progress toward completion require revision. For fixed price Professional Services contracts, when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, the estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes evident. Changes in assumptions underlying these estimates and costs could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition and loss recognition. Distributors selling our high end products generally purchase our products at the time an end user is identified. Distributors selling our higher volume products may carry our products as inventory. We recognize revenue when we sell to our distributors only if all applicable revenue recognition criteria are met. These criteria include the price to the buyer being substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale and the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated. The revenue we recognize associated with channel sales transactions may require us to make estimates in several areas including: (1) the likelihood of returns; (2) the amount of credits we will give for subsequent changes in our price list (i.e., price protection); (3) the amount of credits we will give for additional discounts in certain competitive transactions (i.e., margin protection); (4) the amount of stock rotation; and (5) the creditworthiness of the distributors. When applicable, we reduce revenue in these areas using assumptions that are based on our historical experience. Changes in these assumptions could require us to make significant revisions to our estimates that could materially impact the amount of net revenue recognized. Restructuring We have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures, which are accounted for under SFAS 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits (SFAS 112) and SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). Our restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including: 1) realizable values of assets made redundant, obsolete or excess; 2) expenses for severance and other employee separation costs; 3) the ability to generate sublease income, as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated; and 4) other exit costs. The amounts we have accrued represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur in connection with these actions, but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Business Combinations In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, as well as IPRD based on their estimated fair values. This valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by the company and our competitors, individual product sales cycles, the estimated lives of each of the products underlying technology, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired companys brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and discount rates. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. To estimate restructuring liabilities, management utilized assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of costs associated with the disposition of duplicate or excess acquired facilities. Decreases to the estimates of currently approved acquisition related restructuring plans are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) as amended by SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158) which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. This determination involves the selection of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. 43 Table of Contents A key assumption in determining our net pension expense in accordance with SFAS 87 is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. To determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. We apply our expected rate of return to a market related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in the amounts to which we apply that expected return. While we give appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long term, prospective rates of return. Changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized associated with our pension plans. Another key assumption in determining our net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations. We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to address projected future benefits. Changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized association with our pension plans. Income Taxes On July 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of a valuation allowance in a specific taxing jurisdiction. Likewise, the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to certain of our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowances. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation We account for share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires that share based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair values. In addition, we have applied the provisions of the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 in our accounting for Statement 123(R). 44 Table of Contents We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true ups could materially affect our operating results. As required by Statement 123(R), we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments issued or assumed after June 1, 2006 that are expected to vest. For all share based payments granted or assumed beginning June 1, 2006, we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The fair value of the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to June 1, 2006 is recognized over the remaining service period using the straight line method, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates. Stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider on an annual basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical or implied volatility on a stand alone basis. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used the same historical rate for all employee groups. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates, the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of certain other recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition. NON AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Our Audit Committee has pre approved all non audit services including tax compliance services. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. To mitigate some of these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at June 30, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. 45 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Our debt investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of 0.19 years, 0.16 years and 0.25 years as of June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in duration from June 30, 2009, as compared to June 30, 2008, was not significant. The decrease in the average duration of our portfolio at June 30, 2008, as compared to June 30, 2007, was due to the decision to maintain short positions in anticipation of the stock repurchase program and due to the liquidation of securities in order to repatriate $1 billion of foreign earnings. The primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. These available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of these securities may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis was performed on this investment portfolio based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical fair market value changes (using a three month horizon) that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 150 basis points (BPS). Based on this analysis, for example, a hypothetical 150 BPS increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $6.5 million decrease in the fair value of our investments in debt securities as of June 30, 2009, as compared with a $6 million decrease as of June 30, 2008. We also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the Senior Notes so that the interest payable on the Senior Notes effectively becomes variable and thus matches the shorter term rates received from our cash and marketable securities. Accordingly, interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our Senior Notes outstanding, which will be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. However, by entering into these swap agreements, we have a cash flow exposure related to the risk that interest rates may increase. For example, at June 30, 2009, a hypothetical 150 BPS increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1 million increase in interest expense over a one year period. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities outside the U.S., we enter into transactions in other currencies. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. We are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, can benefit from a weaker dollar and can be adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect our consolidated sales and operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. To minimize currency exposure gains and losses, we often borrow funds in local currencies, enter into forward exchange contracts, purchase foreign currency options and promote natural hedges by purchasing components and incurring expenses in local currencies. Currently, we have no plans to discontinue our hedging programs, however, we continually evaluate the benefits of our hedging strategies and may choose to discontinue them in the future. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at June 30, 2009, we estimate a maximum potential one day loss in fair value of approximately $6 million, as compared with $2 million as of June 30, 2008, using a Value at Risk (VAR) model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. We used a Monte Carlo simulation type model that valued foreign currency instruments against three thousand randomly generated market price paths. Anticipated transactions, firm commitments, receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool and as such is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us. Additionally, as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure. Equity Security Price Risk Based on a fair value of $11 million, the risk to our marketable equity portfolio is insignificant. 46 Table of Contents

We share these innovations in order to grow communities, in turn increasing participation on the network and building new market opportunities while maintaining partnerships with some of the most innovative technology companies in the world. On April 19, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement under which Oracle Corporation (Oracle) will acquire all of our common stock, through a merger, for $9.50 per share in cash and we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle. On July 16, 2009, our stockholders adopted the merger agreement at a special meeting of the stockholders. On August 20, 2009, the United States Department of Justice notified us that it had approved the proposed acquisition by Oracle. The completion of the transaction is subject to receiving certain foreign regulatory approvals and various other closing conditions. Summary of Results Our fiscal year 2009 results were negatively affected by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. This has adversely impacted our business across nearly all geographies and industries. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2008: Total revenue decreased by 31%. Server Product revenue decreased by approximately $623 million, or 36%. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points. We recorded restructuring charges of $64 million as compared to $104 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We canceled development of our next generation microprocessor and recorded vendor claims and impairments of, intellectual property of approximately $30 million associated with the cancellation. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: Total revenue decreased by $2.4 billion, or 18%. Research and development expenses decreased by $186 million, or 10%. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $494 million, or 12.5% We impaired approximately $1.4 billion of our goodwill. We recorded restructuring charges of $395 million as compared to $263 million in fiscal 2008. Interest and other income (expense) decreased by $163 million, or 101% We ended the fiscal year 2009 with a cash and marketable debt securities balance of $3.1 billion. Over the last year we introduced enhanced M Series enterprise servers, open storage products and the next generation of mid range disk arrays. 27 Table of Contents Revenues For the fiscal year ended June 30 (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Systems Server Products $ 4,819 $ (1,445 ) (23.1)% $ 6,264 $ (191 ) (3.0)% $ 6,455 Storage Products 1,885 (469 ) (19.9)% 2,354 38 1.6% 2,316 Systems revenue $ 6,704 $ (1,914 ) (22.2)% $ 8,618 $ (153 ) (1.7)% $ 8,771 Services Support Services $ 3,648 $ (375 ) (9.3)% $ 4,023 $ 61 1.5% $ 3,962 Professional and Educational Services 1,097 (142 ) (11.5)% 1,239 99 8.7% 1,140 Services revenue $ 4,745 $ (517 ) (9.8)% $ 5,262 $ 160 3.1% $ 5,102 Total revenues $ 11,449 $ (2,431 ) (17.5)% $ 13,880 $ 7 0.1% $ 13,873 Systems Revenue Our Systems products provide customers with business solutions requiring advanced server and storage capabilities. Our enterprise Server Products include our high end and midrange SPARC&reg; based servers which provide solutions for virtualization and consolidating, web tier environments, large scale enterprise applications and related software. Our volume Server Products offer flexible low cost enterprise, midrange and entry level solutions that include our Chip Multi Threading (CMT) servers and x64 based servers. Our enterprise, midrange and entry level Storage Products include disk and tape products that provide solutions for mainframe and open systems environments. Our disk Storage Products include entry level, midrange and enterprise arrays and associated connectivity devices such as host bus adapters. Our tape Storage Products include entry level, midrange and enterprise libraries and virtual storage solutions. Server Products Revenue The decrease in our Server Products revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the economic downturn as projects were scaled back, delayed or canceled in addition to increased competition and aggressive discounting, and the weakness in demand for high end servers. The decrease spanned most of our Server product categories. In the fourth quarter, revenue was negatively impacted by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. Revenue was also unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of Olympus Product Line (OPL) data center and midrange servers and our CMT volume servers. The decrease in Server Products revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to the change to certain distributor programs under which we are no longer able to meet certain criteria for revenue recognition at the time of sale to our distributors. There was a corresponding increase in deferred products revenue over the same time period. In addition, we experienced decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based server products, decreased sales of our x64 based rack server products and decreased sales of our mid range server products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based server products were due to reduced customer demand as products are near their end of life (EOL). Decreased sales of our x64 based rack server products were primarily due to the delayed introduction of AMD quad core based products. Decreased sales of our mid range server products were primarily due to a partial shift to volume products and due to certain of our products were near their EOL. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our CMT volume server products, increased sales of our blade server products and increased sales of our OPL server products. Increased sales of our CMT volume server products and our blade server products were primarily the result of continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Storage Products Revenue The decrease in Storage Products revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily attributable to the economic downturn as projects were scaled back, delayed or canceled and increased competition and aggressive discounting with respect to our tape and enterprise disc array products. In the fourth quarter, revenue was also negatively impacted by the economic downturn, the uncertainty associated with our proposed acquisition by Oracle, increased competition and delays in customer purchasing decisions. In addition, as disk products frequently attach to our servers, declines in Server revenue contributed to decline in our disk products. Revenue was also unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our open storage products. 28 Table of Contents The increase in Storage Products revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of enterprise and mid range disk products, and increased sales of tape media. Increased sales of enterprise disk products were due to product introductions, including enterprise disk model. Increased sales of mid range disk products were due to improved functionality and scalability in addition to sales initiatives. Increased sales of our tape media products were due to the increase in our installed base. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of our enterprise and OEM tape drive products and Virtual Storage Manager (VSM) mainframe products. Decreased sales of our enterprise and OEM tape drive products were primarily due to delayed product introductions. Decreased sales of our VSM mainframe products were primarily due to the competitive and declining mainframe market. Services Revenue Services revenue consists of Support Services revenue and Professional and Educational Services revenue. Support Services Revenue Support Services consists of Support Services and Managed Services. Support Services offer customers technical support, software and firmware updates, online tools, product repair and maintenance and preventive services for system, storage and software products. Managed Services include on site and remote monitoring and management for the components of their information technology (IT) infrastructure, including operating systems, third party and custom applications, databases, networks, security, storage and the web. Support Services revenue consists primarily of maintenance contract revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual period and represented approximately 77%, 76%, and 78% of Services revenue in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in Support Services revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the cumulative effect of decreases in our installed Server Product base over the last six quarters, increased discounting and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We continue to see pricing pressure on renewals and the impact of the shift in sales of our Server Products from enterprise to volume servers. The increase in Support Services revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of our Managed Services and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange movements. Increased sales of our Managed Services were primarily the result of increased demand for remote and managed site offerings and the shift to single supplier multi vendor support models which are displacing traditional maintenance support service models. We experienced pricing pressure on maintenance contracts sold or renewed primarily due to customers choosing lower cost solutions. Professional and Educational Services Revenue Professional Services enable customers to reduce costs and complexity, improve operational efficiency and build or transform the IT infrastructure. Professional Services include IT assessments, architectural services, implementation services, and consolidation and migration services. Educational Services include training and certification for individuals and teams. The decrease in Professional and Educational Services revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the delay, cancellation or scaling back of projects. In addition, discretionary training was reduced due to the unfavorable economic environment. Professional and Educational Services revenues were also negatively impacted by unfavorable currency exchange rates. The increase in Professional and Educational Services revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased Professional Services revenue as a result of increased demand for High Performance Computing (HPC), data management and specialized identity management projects. Additionally, we experienced an increased demand for consolidation and virtualization services which use software applications to divide one physical server into multiple isolated environments creating greater efficiency in the use of servers. Increases in Educational Services revenue were primarily due to continued Solaris adoption and the related training needs. 29 Table of Contents Net Revenues by Geographic Area For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 North America $ 4,559 $ (1,038 ) (18.5)% $ 5,597 $ (367 ) (6.2)% $ 5,964 Percentage of net revenues 39.8 % (0.5) pts 40.3 % (2.7) pts 43.0 % International revenues: Europe $ 3,763 $ (868 ) (18.7)% $ 4,631 $ 182 (4.1)% $ 4,449 Percentage of net revenues 32.9 % (0.5) pts 33.4 % 1.3 pts 32.1 % Emerging Markets Region $ 1,794 $ (175 ) (8.9)% $ 1,969 $ 239 13.80% $ 1,730 Percentage of net revenues 15.7 % 1.5 pts 14.2 % 1.7 pts 12.5 % APAC (Asia, Australia and New Zealand) $ 1,333 $ (350 ) (20.8)% $ 1,683 $ (47 ) (2.7)% $ 1,730 Percentage of net revenues 11.6 % (0.5) pts 12.1 % (0.4) pts 12.5 % Total international revenues $ 6,890 $ (1,393 ) (16.8)% $ 8,283 $ 374 4.7% $ 7,909 Percentage of net revenues 60.2 % 0.3 pts 59.7 % 3.3 pts 57.0 % Total net revenues $ 11,449 $ (2,431 ) (17.5)% $ 13,880 $ 7 0.1% $ 13,873 United States (U.S.) (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 U.S. $ 4,253 $ (945 ) (18.2 )% $ 5,198 $ (443 ) (7.9 )% $ 5,641 The decrease in U.S. revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of our enterprise and volume Server Products, enterprise storage arrays and our Services. Enterprise and volume Server Product sales decreased primarily due to weak economic conditions, which caused our customers to scale back or defer projects. We continue to see a decline in investments for IT in our financial services, communications and government server markets. Enterprise storage array and tape sales declined due to competitive pressures which led to aggressive discounting. These declines were offset by increased sales of our open storage products and our CMT servers. The decrease in Services sales was primarily attributable to the declining Systems installed base, delays in service contract renewals, increased discounting due to competitive pressures and a reduction in consolidation and customized products. The decrease in U.S. net revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to decreased sales of our Server and Storage Products, decreased sales of our Services and a change to certain distributor programs under which we are no longer able to meet certain criteria for revenue recognition at the time of sale in to our distributors. Decreased sales of Server Products were due to decreased sales of our traditional SPARC volume products, data center and mid range enterprise server products and x64 based rack Server Products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based Server Products were primarily due to reduced customer demand as products are near their EOL. Decreased sales of our data center and mid range Server Products were due to a partial shift to volume products and certain products nearing their EOL. Decreased sales of our x64 based rack Server Products were primarily due to the delayed introduction of AMD quad core based products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our CMT based SPARC volume Server Products and blade Server Products. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products and our blade Server Products were the result of continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Decreased sales of our Storage Products were due to decreased sales of our enterprise and entry level disk products and decreased sales of our enterprise tape drive products due to weak demand in the first half of fiscal 2008 for these products. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of tape media due to increases in our installed base. We experienced decreased Services revenue primarily due to a decrease in Support Services revenue. Decreased Support Services revenue was due to an increasingly competitive environment, particularly within the telecommunications sector due to recent acquisition and consolidation activity within the sector and increased competitive pressures. International Revenues The following table sets forth net revenues in geographic markets contributing significantly to changes in international net revenues during the last three fiscal years ended June 30: (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Emerging Markets(1) $ 1,794 $ (175 ) (8.9 )% $ 1,969 $ 239 13.8 % $ 1,730 Central and North EMEA(CNE)(2) $ 1,038 $ (211 ) (16.9 )% $ 1,249 $ 146 13.2 % $ 1,103 United Kingdom $ 818 $ (337 ) (29.2 )% $ 1,155 $ 25 2.2 % $ 1,130 Germany $ 872 $ (121 ) (12.2 )% $ 993 $ 0.0 % $ 993 30 Table of Contents (1) Emerging Markets consists primarily of China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and United Arab Emirates (UAE). (2) CNE consists primarily of Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Revenues in fiscal 2007 have been adjusted to reflect a change in the composition of countries that make up CNE. Emerging Markets The decrease in revenue for most of the countries in our Emerging Markets during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of certain enterprise and volume servers and our tape and storage array products. These declines were primarily a result of the reduction in customer projects due to the economic downturn. Revenue was also affected by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were offset by increased sales of our Support and Professional Services due to infrastructure buildouts and the demand for traditional Support Services. The increase in revenue during fiscal 2008, as compared fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased sales of our volume server and mid range disc Systems products. Increased Systems sales were due to the developing infrastructure programs and strong demand from our telecommunications customers. The increase in Systems sales was partially offset by decreased sales of our enterprise server products. Our Services sales increased due to increased Professional Services sales primarily as a result of increased demand for consolidation, installation and customization projects. CNE CNE revenue decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, across all parts of our business due to the challenging economic environment and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Decreased sales of enterprise and volume servers and Storage Products were primarily due to the delay or cancellation of projects by customers. Services revenue decreased primarily due to discounting and customers delaying renewals. The increase in CNE revenues during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was due to increased sales of Systems Products, increased sales of Services and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales of Systems Products were due to increased sales of data center Server Products, increased sales of CMT based SPARC Server Products and increased sales of our blade Server Products. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products and our blade Server Products were the result of the continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Increased Services sales were due to increased Support Services sales. Increased Support Services sales were due to increased demand from the government and telecommunications sectors. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of traditional volume SPARC based Server Products. Decreased sales of our traditional volume SPARC based Server Products were primarily due to reduced customer demand as products were near their EOL. United Kingdom (U.K.) The decrease in U.K. revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was across all parts of our business. A majority of our customers in the U.K. are in the telecommunications and financial services sectors which are both declining. Our customers in these sectors continue to be cautious, resulting in longer sales cycles or cancellations. In addition, there has been a shift in demand to lower end Systems products. Our Services performance was adversely affected by a number of contract losses and renegotiations. Services revenue is also being impacted by a shift in product mix from high end to x86 which has a much lower attach rate. Revenue was also impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.K. revenues during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased sales of CMT volume server products, increased sales of data center Server Products and the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales of our CMT volume Server Products were the result of the continued acceptance of our products based on the UltraSPARC T2 plus processor. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were primarily attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of traditional volume SPARC based server products due to reduced customer demand as products were near their EOL. We experienced declines in Support Services sales due to decreased spending on services within the governmental and financial services sectors. Germany The decrease in Germany revenue during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to decreased sales of enterprise servers, Services and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Enterprise server revenue decreased primarily due to project delays or cancellations due to the economic downturn. Support Services revenue decreased due to discounting and erosion of the installed base. Decreases in enterprise servers and Support Services revenue were partially offset by increased sales of our enterprise libraries and increased Professional Service sales. 31 Table of Contents Revenues in Germany were unchanged during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Increased Systems product sales and the benefit of favorable foreign currency exchange rates were offset by decreased Services revenue. Increased Systems product sales were a result of increased sales of our data center enterprise server products and our Netra Server Products. Increased sales of our data center Server Products were primarily attributable to the introduction of our OPL product offering. Increased Netra Server Product sales were primarily due to increased demand within the telecommunications sector. Decreased Services sales were primarily due to decreased Professional Services sales due to decreased demand from the financial services sector. Gross Margin For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Systems products gross margin $ 2,580 $ (1,370 ) (34.7)% $ 3,950 $ (10 ) (0.3)% $ 3,960 Percentage of Systems products net revenue 38.5% (7.3) pts 45.8% 0.7 pts 45.1% Services gross margin $ 2,151 $ (354 ) (14.1)% $ 2,505 $ 200 8.7% $ 2,305 Percentage of Services net revenue 45.3% (2.3) pts 47.6% 2.4 pts 45.2% Total gross margin $ 4,731 $ (1,724 ) (26.7)% $ 6,455 $ 190 3.0% $ 6,265 Percentage of net revenues 41.3% (5.2) pts 46.5% 1.3 pts 45.2% Systems Gross Margin Systems products gross margin percentage is influenced by numerous factors including product volume and mix, pricing, geographic mix, foreign currency exchange rates, the mix between sales to resellers and end users, third party costs (including both raw material and manufacturing costs), warranty costs and charges related to excess and obsolete inventory. Many of these factors influence, or are interrelated with, other factors. As a result, it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually. Accordingly, the following quantification of the reasons for the change in the Systems products gross margin percentage is an estimate only. During fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, Systems products gross margin decreased approximately seven percentage points primarily due to: pricing and discounting actions of six percentage points and unfavorable changes in sales mix and volume of five percentage points. Unfavorable margin impacts associated with pricing and discounting were due to increased competitive pressure. Unfavorable volume and mix variances were primarily due to decreased sales of our higher end Systems products as a percentage of total sales. These unfavorable impacts to gross margin were partially offset by a four percentage point increase associated with material cost savings. Systems products gross margin increased by approximately one percentage point during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Decreasing material costs and our supply chain restructuring efforts combined to increase gross margin by approximately ten percentage points. Offsetting this increase was the impact of pricing and discounting actions by approximately nine percentage points. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin percentage is influenced by numerous factors including services mix, pricing, geographic mix, foreign currency exchange rates and third party costs. Many of these factors influence, or are interrelated with, other factors. As a result, it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of each item individually. Accordingly, the following quantification of the reasons for the change in the Services gross margin percentage is an estimate only. During fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, Services gross margin decreased by approximately two percentage points. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a four percentage point decrease associated with unfavorable changes in sales mix and volume. This decrease was partially offset by a two percentage point increase due to improved delivery efficiencies and lower services costs. Services gross margin increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Cost savings associated with better utilization rates and decreased costs associated with compensation benefited gross margin by approximately three percentage points. This increase was partially offset by unfavorable changes in services mix of approximately one percentage point. 32 Table of Contents Operating Expenses For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Research and development $ 1,648 $ (186 ) (10.1)% $ 1,834 $ (174 ) (8.7)% $ 2,008 Percentage of net revenues 14.4 % 1.2 pts 13.2 % (1.3) pts 14.5 % Selling, general and administrative $ 3,461 $ (494 ) (12.5)% $ 3,955 $ 104 2.7% $ 3,851 Percentage of net revenues 30.2 % 1.7 pts 28.5 % 0.7 pts 27.8 % Restructuring charges $ 395 $ 132 50.2% $ 263 $ 166 171.1% $ 97 Percentage of net revenues 3.5 % 1.6 pts 1.9 % 1.2 pts 0.7 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets $ 1,460 $ 1,460 $ $ $ Percentage of net revenues 12.8 % 12.8pts Purchased in process research and development $ 3 $ (28 ) $ 31 $ 31 $ Percentage of net revenues (0.2) pts 0.2 % 0.2 pts Total operating expenses $ 6,967 $ 884 14.5% $ 6,083 $ 127 2.1% $ 5,956 *N/M Not meaningful Research and Development Expenses (R&D Expenses) R&D expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the decreases in performance based compensation, lower compensation and benefits resulting from head count reductions, and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. Lower prototype expenses also contributed to the decline. During fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, R&D expenses decreased primarily due to decrease in compensation and benefit expenses, including incentive based compensation, a decrease in prototype expenses associated with a new product introductions and decreases in depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses from outside service providers. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A Expenses) SG&A expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits from head count reductions, decreases in performance based compensation and favorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase to SG&A expenses during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, increased marketing expenses and increased expenses associated with outside services and travel. The increase in SG&A was primarily a result of increased compensation and benefit expenses associated with additional sales employees added to our high sales growth regions and additional employees from our recent acquisitions, increased marketing expenses associated with equipment placement programs, increased service provider expenses and increased travel expenses associated with our multi year internal systems implementation effort. We experienced increased facilities and occupancy expense and expenses related to a legal settlement. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses. We are continuing to focus our efforts on achieving additional operating efficiencies by reviewing and improving upon our existing business processes and cost structure. Restructuring and Related Impairment of Long lived Assets During fiscal 2009, we continued implementation of previous restructuring plans in addition to the implementation of our phase IX plan in order to reduce our cost structure, which included reductions of our workforce. As a result of this and prior restructurings, restructuring and related impairment of long lived assets charges for fiscal 2009, was $395 million. For further details, refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill During our fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2008, based on a combination of factors, including the current economic environment, our operating results, and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. Because we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and was reasonably estimable, we recorded a $1,445 million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We finalized our analysis in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and concluded that no further adjustment was necessary. See Item 1A, Risk Factors above for more details. 33 Table of Contents Gain on Equity Investments, Net For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Gain on equity investments, net $ 8 $ (24 ) (75 )% $ 32 $ 26 433.3% $ 6 In fiscal 2009, we recognized a net gain of $8 million on the sale of our equity investments, which primarily consisted of approximately $6 million in gains on the sale of certain equity securities in public companies, $5 million in gains on the sale of certain private investments offset by $5 million of impairments on certain public and private investments. In fiscal 2008, our gain on equity investments, net, of $32 million, was comprised of approximately $13 million in gains on the sale of certain marketable equity investments in publicly held companies and $19 million in gains from private company investments. As of June 30, 2009, our equity investment portfolio of $42 million consisted of $11 million in marketable equity securities, $18 million in equity investments in privately held companies and $13 million in investments in venture capital funds and joint ventures. The ongoing valuation of our investment portfolio may be subject to fluctuations based on whether we participate in additional investment activity or as a result of the occurrence of events outside of our control. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change $ Change % 2008 Change $ Change % 2007 Interest and other income (expense), net $ (2 ) $ (163 ) (101.2 ) $ 161 $ (53 ) (24.8 ) $ 214 The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net, during fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in fiscal 2009. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded impairment charges associated with our debt investment securities of approximately $28 million. The decrease in interest income (expense), net, during fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, was primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in fiscal 2008 resulting from the use of $2.76 billion of our cash for our stock repurchase program and the use of $797 million of cash to purchase MySQL in fiscal 2008. Our interest income and expense are sensitive primarily to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which are predominantly short term fixed income instruments. To better match the interest rate characteristics of our investment portfolio and our issued fixed rate unsecured senior debt securities, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions so that the interest associated with these debt securities effectively becomes variable. Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 51 $ (156 ) $ 207 $ 97 $ 110 During fiscal 2009, we recorded a tax expense of $51 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax expense is net of a tax benefit of $13 million resulting from the enactment of legislation which provided that taxpayers may elect to forego bonus depreciation on certain additions of qualified eligible property and, in turn, claim a refundable credit for a portion of its unused alternative minimum tax and research credits. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which was signed by the President of the United States on July 30, 2008, applied to certain property additions from April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008. On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 was enacted which extended the period for eligible property additions for another year through December 31, 2009. 34 Table of Contents During fiscal 2008, we recorded a tax expense of $207 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The tax expense included a reduction in the U.S. valuation allowance that is credited to other balance sheet accounts and therefore did not benefit the income tax expense. The tax provision for fiscal 2008 was also impacted by a reduction in foreign tax expense as a result of repaying intercompany loans of certain international subsidiaries that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax expense of $110 million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions. The foreign tax expense is net of a benefit of $14 million recorded for the reduction in accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of restructuring of certain European subsidiaries as well as a benefit of $13 million due to a tax law change in Germany. The U.S. tax benefit reflects a benefit of $54 million primarily relating to the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service income tax audit for fiscal 2001 and 2002, and a benefit associated with adjusting estimated amounts to actual liabilities resulting from the filing of the fiscal year 2006 U.S. tax return. This U.S. benefit was offset by the utilization of acquisition net operating losses, increases to various tax reserves, and foreign withholding taxes. U.S. income taxes have been provided on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2009, there are no earnings that are considered to be permanently invested in operations outside of the U.S. However, we may elect to permanently invest in operations outside of the U.S. in the future. We currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain overseas deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. Likewise, the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowance. We have also provided adequate amounts for other anticipated tax audit adjustments in the U.S., state and foreign tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. If our estimate of the federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense could result. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the liabilities would be reversed, and any related tax benefits would be recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. 35 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2009, our investment portfolio was valued at approximately $3.1 billion which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, fixed income assets, and short and long term investments. Exclusive of cash equivalents, approximately 88% of all our investments in debt instrument securities are rated AA/AA2 or better by Standard & Poors (S&P) or Moodys. As of June 30, 2009, approximately 83% of our portfolio excluding cash had a remaining maturity of less than one year. Approximately 16% of our investment portfolio, excluding cash and cash equivalents, contains asset backed securities. Approximately 77% of our investments in asset backed securities were rated AAA by S&P or Moodys, and the expected weighted average remaining maturity was greater than two years. Our portfolio has the following categories of asset backed securities as of June 30, 2009 (dollars in millions): Asset Backed Securities Mortgages $ 98 Autos $ 50 Credit Cards $ 36 Large Equipment $ 2 Other Asset Backed Securities $ 9 $ 195 As of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, (dollars in millions) 2009 Change 2008 Change 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,876 $ (396 ) $ 2,272 $ (1,348 ) $ 3,620 Marketable debt securities 1,185 147 1,038 (1,284 ) 2,322 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $ 3,061 $ (249 ) $ 3,310 $ (2,632 ) $ 5,942 Percentage of total assets 27.3 % (4.2) pts 23.1 % (14.4) pts 37.5 % Cash provided by operating activities $ 457 $ (872 ) $ 1,329 $ 371 $ 958 Cash used in investing activities (707 ) (641 ) (66 ) 1,011 (1,077 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (95 ) 2,516 (2,611 ) (2,781 ) 170 Effects of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (51 ) (51 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (396 ) $ 952 $ (1,348 ) $ (1,399 ) $ 51 Changes in Cash Flow During fiscal 2009, our cash from operating activities was significantly impacted by the following: A net loss of $2,234 million, which was offset by non cash charges of approximately $2,421 million, which primarily included goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,460 million, depreciation and amortization of $474 million, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $296 million and stock based compensation of $192 million; and Changes in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $270 million was primarily due to collections of accounts receivable of $757 million, and the change in prepaids and other assets of $140 million, which was partially offset by payments of accounts payable and other liabilities of $740 million. During fiscal 2009, our cash used in investing activities of $707 million was primarily attributable to purchases of marketable debt securities of $1,813 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment, net, of $466 million. This use of cash was partially offset by cash provided by the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities of $1,638 million. Cash used in financing activities of $95 million was primarily attributable to $130 million paid to purchase stock under our stock repurchase programs. During fiscal 2008, our cash from operating activities was significantly impacted by the following: Net income of $403 million included non cash charges of approximately $965 million, which primarily included depreciation and amortization of $476 million, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of $310 million and stock based compensation of $214 million; and 36 Table of Contents Decreases in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $39 million was primarily due to increases in prepaid and other assets and inventory of $313 million which were partially offset by increases in other liabilities of $298 million. During fiscal 2008, our cash used in investing activities of $66 million was primarily attributable to our purchase of MySQL and other acquisitions, net of cash received of $923 million, purchases of marketable debt securities of $1,333 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $520 million. This use of cash was predominantly offset by cash provided by the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable debt securities of $2,608 million. Our cash used in financing activities of $2,611 million was primarily attributable to $2,764 million paid to purchase stock under our stock repurchase program.

(2) DOS measures the number of days it takes, based on a 90 day average, to sell our inventory. (3) DPO measures the number of days it takes, based on a 90 day average, to pay the balances of our accounts payable. The cash conversion cycle is the duration between the purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash for the sale of our Systems products and Services and is a quarterly metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets. The cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of DSO added to DOS, reduced by DPO. Inventory turns is annualized and represents the number of times product inventory is replenished during the year. At the end of fiscal 2009, DSO negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by five days primarily due to the timing of billings. DOS negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by four days primarily due to an increase in deferred cost of goods sold associated with non standard deals and fair value issues. For fiscal 2008, DOS negatively impacted our cash conversion cycle by six days primarily due to an increase in inventory associated with the introduction of certain distributor programs for which the criteria for revenue recognition could not be satisfied and due to an increase in inventory designed to ensure product availability and rapid delivery to customers. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at June 30, 2009 (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Payments Duein LessThan 1 Year PaymentsDue in1 3 Years PaymentsDue in4 5 Years PaymentsDue After5 Years Senior Notes $ 550 $ 550 $ $ $ Convertible Notes 700 350 350 Non cancelable operating leases 678 179 250 129 120 Purchasing and manufacturing commitments(1) 444 444 IT outsourced services commitments(2) 18 18 Interest on Senior and Convertible Notes 27 10 10 6 1 Defined benefit plans 145 10 25 24 86 Asset retirement obligations(3) 36 5 22 3 6 Other obligations(4) Total contractual obligations $ 2,598 $ 1,216 $ 657 $ 512 $ 213 (1) We estimate that these contractual obligations are due in less than one year from June 30, 2009. This amount does not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities. 37 Table of Contents (2) Represents certain outsourced services where we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled prior to a contractual minimum term. (3) These obligations arise from leased facilities where we have contractual commitments to remove leasehold improvements and return the property to a specified condition when the lease terminates. (4) Other obligations include uncertain tax positions. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments of $94 million of uncertain tax positions and therefore these have been excluded from the table. Capital Commitments Restructuring activities As part of the restructuring announced in November 2008, we expect to incur between $500 to $600 million in severance and benefit costs. These costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2010. For further details, refer to Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Restricted Cash As part of our service based sales arrangement involving a governmental institution in Mexico, we were required to maintain certain guarantee bonds. The total amount of the bonds was approximately $41 million. In fiscal 2008, a security deposit of $41 million was returned to us and replaced with a cash secured letter of credit of $21 million. The deposit of $21 million used to secure the letter of credit is classified as Other non current assets, net, in our June 30, 2009, Consolidated Balance Sheet. Purchase Obligations We utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by us. We also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers. We acquire components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead times and or commercially standard lead times for the particular part or product. Financing Arrangements In August 1999, we issued $1.5 billion of unsecured senior debt securities in four tranches (the Senior Notes) of which $550 million was due on August 15, 2009 and bears interest at 7.65%. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually. We may redeem all or any part of the Senior Notes at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition to an amount determined by a quotation agent, representing the present value of the remaining scheduled payments. The Senior Notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. In addition, we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the Senior Notes so that the interest associated with the Senior Notes effectively becomes variable. Our Board of Directors has authorized our management to repurchase Senior Note debt from time to time in partial or in full branches based on availability of cash and market conditions. As of June 30, 2009, we have not repurchased any debt. On August 17, 2009, we repaid the last tranche of our Senior Notes plus accrued interest. In addition, the related interest rate swap was settled. In January 2007, we issued $350 million principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2012 and $350 million principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2014 (the Convertible Notes), to KKR PEI Solar Holdings, I, Ltd., KKR PEI Solar Holdings, II, Ltd. and Citibank, N.A. in a private placement. Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Notes is convertible into 34.6619 shares of our common stock (or a total of approximately 24 million shares), which is the equivalent of $28.85 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the Convertible Notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we have the option to purchase up to 24 million shares of our common stock at a price of $28.85 per share and we sold warrants to the same financial institution whereby they have the option to purchase up to 24 million shares of our common stock. The separate note hedge and warrant transactions were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the Convertible Notes. 38 Table of Contents Acquisitions An active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. Typically, the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the United States within six to twelve months after the closing of the acquisition. Integration activities for international operations, particularly in Europe, generally take longer. Stock Repurchases In May 2007, our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to $3 billion of our outstanding common stock. Under the authorization, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009, all funds authorized under the May 2007 authorization had been utilized. In July 2008, our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to $1 billion of our outstanding common stock. Under the authorization, the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors, such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for acquisitions, repayment of debt and our share price. During fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2008, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares, or $130 million of our common stock, under these authorizations. There were no shares repurchased in the second, third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 under the July 2008 repurchase authorization and as of June 30, 2009, approximately $906 million remained available under this repurchase authorization. See Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Contractual Obligations We maintain a program of insurance with third party insurers for certain property, casualty and other risks. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self insurance basis. We retain risk with regard to (i) certain loss events, such as California earthquakes and the indemnification or defense payments we, as a company, may make to or on behalf of our directors and officers as a result of obligations under applicable agreements, our by laws and applicable law, (ii) potential liabilities under a number of health and welfare insurance plans that we sponsor for our employees and (iii) other potential liabilities that are not insured. The types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions. We reserve for loss accruals, which are primarily calculated using actuarial methods. These loss accruals include amounts for actual claims, claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported. Actual experience, including claim frequency and severity as well as inflation, could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded. In the normal course of business, we may enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnification obligations have not been material. 39 Table of Contents In September 2004, private plaintiffs known as relators filed an action against us on behalf of the government of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Arkansas alleging that certain rebates, discounts and other payments or benefits provided by us to our resellers and technology integrators constitute kickbacks in violation of the federal Anti Kickback Act, because such benefits allegedly should have been disclosed to and or passed on to the government. That action was filed under seal, and the complaint was not unsealed until April 2007. Later in fiscal 2005, the General Services Administration (GSA) began auditing our records under the agreements it had with us at that time. The GSAs auditors alleged that we failed to provide agreed upon discounts in accordance with the contracts price reduction clauses and further alleged that certain pricing disclosures made by us to the GSA were substantially incomplete, false or misleading, resulting in defective pricing. In April 2007, the United States Department of Justice filed a complaint intervening in the lawsuit in Arkansas described above. The governments complaint includes claims related to both the kickback claims in the relators original complaint and other claims related to the GSA audit described above, including claims under the federal False Claims Act, breach of contract, and other related claims. The governments complaint does not identify the amount of damages it claims or intends to claim. The parties continue to discuss the nature of the governments current and potential claims on our GSA and other government sales. If this matter proceeds to trial, possible sanctions include an award of damages, including treble damages, fines, penalties and other sanctions, up to and including suspension or debarment from sales to the federal government. Although we are interested in pursuing an amicable resolution, we intend to present a vigorous factual and legal defense throughout the course of these proceedings. As required by SFAS 5, we accrue for contingencies when we believe that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss. We have made an assessment of the probability of incurring any such losses and such amounts are reflected in other non current obligations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and it is difficult to predict the outcome of particular matters with reasonable certainty and, therefore, the actual amount of any loss may prove to be larger or smaller than the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2009, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Capital Resources and Financial Condition Our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents in subsidiaries for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. At June 30, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.9 billion. Our remaining investments of $1.2 billion were held in marketable debt securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities position at June 30, 2009, was approximately $3.1 billion. We believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe our level of financial resources is a significant competitive factor in our industry and we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position, facilitate growth and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 describes the significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, however, to the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and our actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We believe the accounting policies discussed below reflect our more significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Fair Value Accounting Effective July 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS, No. 157 to account for our financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. 40 Table of Contents The fair value of our Level 1 financial assets is based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security and generally include cash, money market funds and United States Treasury securities with quoted prices in active markets. Determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. The fair value of our Level 2 financial assets is based on observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency and generally include United States government agency debt securities, corporate notes/bonds, certificates of deposit and derivative instruments. These Level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to Level 1 instruments which include determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced, determining whether the market is active and determining which model derived valuations are to be used when calculating fair value. We perform our analysis with the assistance of pricing services. We do not hold any Level 3 instruments. In accordance with SFAS 159 which we adopted on July 1, 2008, we evaluated our existing eligible financial assets and liabilities and elected not to adopt the fair value option for any eligible items during fiscal 2009. However, because the SFAS 159 election is based on an instrument by instrument election at the time we first recognize an eligible item or enter into an eligible firm commitment, we may decide to exercise the option on new items when business reasons support doing so in the future. Impairment of Debt Investment Securities We review our investment portfolio regularly for impairment. A security is considered impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell it prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is deemed to have occurred. In these instances, the OTTI loss is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt securitys amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell an impaired debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell it prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we assess whether we will recover securitys amortized cost basis. If we conclude we will not, a credit loss exists and the securitys impairment is separated into: The amount representing the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings as OTTI, and The amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. As part of this assessment we consider various characteristics of each security including, but not limited to: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area; the payment structure of the debt security; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and related outlook or status; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date. The relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security, as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment. Should the actual credit loss related impairment differ from our estimates, the amount of the investment impairment charges and their timing could be materially impacted. Impairment of Marketable and Non Marketable Equity Securities We periodically review our marketable equity securities, as well as our non marketable equity securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other than temporary. Factors we consider to make such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, as well as the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period. If any impairment is considered other than temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Goodwill and Other Long Lived Assets We account for business acquisitions in accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, (SFAS 141) and the subsequent accounting for goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) and SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The impairment analysis is performed at one level below the operating segment level as defined in SFAS 142. 41 Table of Contents In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates based on a combination of the income approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on future discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units, such as property and equipment and accounts receivable, are not held by those reporting units but by functional departments (for example, our Global Sales and Services organization and Worldwide Operations organization). Prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we are required to assess long lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit, then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. Only after this process is completed is the amount of any goodwill impairment determined. SFAS 144 is the authoritative standard on the accounting for the impairment of other long lived assets. In accordance with SFAS 144 and our internal accounting policy, we perform tests for impairment of intangible long lived assets semi annually and whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long lived assets may be impaired. This analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset (or assets) are less than the carrying value of the asset (or assets) we are testing for impairment. If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value. We typically estimate the fair value of long lived assets using the income approach. As of June 30, 2009, we had a goodwill balance of $1,743 million. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analysis, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their estimated remaining useful lives. In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and property and equipment to the balance sheet for those reporting units. We also consider our market capitalization (adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash, marketable debt securities and debt) on the date we perform the analysis. As a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our $1,743 million goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) A decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of either of our software or services reporting units below their carrying values; (2) Further weakening of the global economy, continued weakness in the network computing industry, or failure of Sun to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cashflows and reduce the estimated discounted cashflow value of our reporting units. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result from these factors, or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other long lived assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business, changes in market conditions or a longer term decline in the quoted market price of our stock will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods. Failure to achieve our forecasted operating results, due to further weakness in the economic environment or other factors, could result in impairment of a significant amount of our long lived intangible or tangible assets. As of June 30, 2009, we had $269 million of long lived intangible assets and $1,616 million of long lived tangible assets. Revenue Recognition As discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we enter into agreements to sell hardware, software, services and multiple deliverable arrangements that include combinations of products and or services. Additionally, while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions, there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including: (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables if there are multiple deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements. In addition, our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collectibility is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. Changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition. 42 Table of Contents We recognize revenue as work progresses on fixed price Professional Services contracts when we can reliably evaluate progress to completion. We perform periodic analysis of these contracts in order to determine if the applicable estimates regarding total revenue, total cost and the extent of progress toward completion require revision. For fixed price Professional Services contracts, when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, the estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes evident. Changes in assumptions underlying these estimates and costs could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition and loss recognition. Distributors selling our high end products generally purchase our products at the time an end user is identified. Distributors selling our higher volume products may carry our products as inventory. We recognize revenue when we sell to our distributors only if all applicable revenue recognition criteria are met. These criteria include the price to the buyer being substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale and the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated. The revenue we recognize associated with channel sales transactions may require us to make estimates in several areas including: (1) the likelihood of returns; (2) the amount of credits we will give for subsequent changes in our price list (i.e., price protection); (3) the amount of credits we will give for additional discounts in certain competitive transactions (i.e., margin protection); (4) the amount of stock rotation; and (5) the creditworthiness of the distributors. When applicable, we reduce revenue in these areas using assumptions that are based on our historical experience. Changes in these assumptions could require us to make significant revisions to our estimates that could materially impact the amount of net revenue recognized. Restructuring We have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures, which are accounted for under SFAS 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits (SFAS 112) and SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). Our restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including: 1) realizable values of assets made redundant, obsolete or excess; 2) expenses for severance and other employee separation costs; 3) the ability to generate sublease income, as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated; and 4) other exit costs. The amounts we have accrued represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur in connection with these actions, but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. Business Combinations In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, as well as IPRD based on their estimated fair values. This valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry trends, the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by the company and our competitors, individual product sales cycles, the estimated lives of each of the products underlying technology, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired companys brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and discount rates. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. To estimate restructuring liabilities, management utilized assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of costs associated with the disposition of duplicate or excess acquired facilities. Decreases to the estimates of currently approved acquisition related restructuring plans are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) as amended by SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158) which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. This determination involves the selection of various assumptions, including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. 43 Table of Contents A key assumption in determining our net pension expense in accordance with SFAS 87 is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. To determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. We apply our expected rate of return to a market related value of assets, which stabilizes variability in the amounts to which we apply that expected return. While we give appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long term, prospective rates of return. Changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized associated with our pension plans. Another key assumption in determining our net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations. We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to address projected future benefits. Changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized association with our pension plans. Income Taxes On July 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further discussion. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of a valuation allowance in a specific taxing jurisdiction. Likewise, the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to certain of our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowances. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period. Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Stock Based Compensation We account for share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires that share based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their fair values. In addition, we have applied the provisions of the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 in our accounting for Statement 123(R). 44 Table of Contents We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true ups could materially affect our operating results. As required by Statement 123(R), we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments issued or assumed after June 1, 2006 that are expected to vest. For all share based payments granted or assumed beginning June 1, 2006, we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally four years. The fair value of the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to June 1, 2006 is recognized over the remaining service period using the straight line method, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates. Stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider on an annual basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility of our publicly traded, longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical or implied volatility on a stand alone basis. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used the same historical rate for all employee groups. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary. We record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized. In addition, differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero, then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense. To the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates, the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of certain other recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition. NON AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Our Audit Committee has pre approved all non audit services including tax compliance services. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. To mitigate some of these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at June 30, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. 45 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Our debt investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of 0.19 years, 0.16 years and 0.25 years as of June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in duration from June 30, 2009, as compared to June 30, 2008, was not significant. The decrease in the average duration of our portfolio at June 30, 2008, as compared to June 30, 2007, was due to the decision to maintain short positions in anticipation of the stock repurchase program and due to the liquidation of securities in order to repatriate $1 billion of foreign earnings. The primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. These available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of these securities may fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A sensitivity analysis was performed on this investment portfolio based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical fair market value changes (using a three month horizon) that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 150 basis points (BPS). Based on this analysis, for example, a hypothetical 150 BPS increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $6.5 million decrease in the fair value of our investments in debt securities as of June 30, 2009, as compared with a $6 million decrease as of June 30, 2008. We also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the Senior Notes so that the interest payable on the Senior Notes effectively becomes variable and thus matches the shorter term rates received from our cash and marketable securities. Accordingly, interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our Senior Notes outstanding, which will be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements. However, by entering into these swap agreements, we have a cash flow exposure related to the risk that interest rates may increase. For example, at June 30, 2009, a hypothetical 150 BPS increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1 million increase in interest expense over a one year period. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities outside the U.S., we enter into transactions in other currencies. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. We are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, can benefit from a weaker dollar and can be adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect our consolidated sales and operating margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. To minimize currency exposure gains and losses, we often borrow funds in local currencies, enter into forward exchange contracts, purchase foreign currency options and promote natural hedges by purchasing components and incurring expenses in local currencies. Currently, we have no plans to discontinue our hedging programs, however, we continually evaluate the benefits of our hedging strategies and may choose to discontinue them in the future. Based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at June 30, 2009, we estimate a maximum potential one day loss in fair value of approximately $6 million, as compared with $2 million as of June 30, 2008, using a Value at Risk (VAR) model. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. We used a Monte Carlo simulation type model that valued foreign currency instruments against three thousand randomly generated market price paths. Anticipated transactions, firm commitments, receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool and as such is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us. Additionally, as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure. Equity Security Price Risk Based on a fair value of $11 million, the risk to our marketable equity portfolio is insignificant. 46 Table of Contents
