BUSINESS OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED BUSINESS UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns the outstanding common stock of TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. (UES), Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. (Millennium), and UniSource Energy Development Company (UED). TEP, an electric utility, has provided electric service to the community of Tucson, Arizona, for over 100 years. UES was established in 2003, when it acquired the Arizona gas and electric properties from Citizens. UES, through its two operating subsidiaries, UNS Gas, Inc. (UNS Gas) and UNS Electric, Inc. (UNS Electric), provides gas and electric service to 30 communities in Northern and Southern Arizona. Millennium has existing investments in unregulated businesses; no new investments are planned in Millennium. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold its interest in Global Solar Energy, Inc. (Global Solar), its largest holding. UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS), a gas turbine project in Northern Arizona that, subject to ACC approval, is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. We conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. UniSource Energy was incorporated in the State of Arizona in 1995 and obtained regulatory approval to form a holding company in 1997. In 1998, TEP and UniSource Energy exchanged shares of stock resulting in TEP becoming a subsidiary of UniSource Energy. Following the share exchange, TEP transferred the stock of its subsidiary Millennium to UniSource Energy.

References in this report to we and our are to UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries, collectively. TEP ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS TEP was incorporated in the State of Arizona in 1963. TEP is the principal operating subsidiary of UniSource Energy. In 2006, TEPs electric utility operations contributed 76% of UniSource Energys operating revenues and comprised 82% of its assets. SERVICE AREA AND CUSTOMERS TEP is a vertically integrated utility that provides regulated electric service to more than 392,000 retail customers in Southeastern Arizona. TEPs service territory consists of a 1,155 square mile area and includes a population of approximately 1 million in the greater Tucson metropolitan area in Pima County, as well as parts of Cochise County. TEP holds a franchise to provide electric distribution service to customers in the Cities of Tucson and South Tucson. These franchises expire in 2026 and 2017, respectively. TEP also sells electricity to other utilities and power marketing entities in the Western U.S. Retail Customers TEP provides electric utility service to a diverse group of residential, commercial, industrial, and public sector customers. Major industries served include copper mining, cement manufacturing, defense, health care, education, military bases and other governmental entities. TEPs retail sales are influenced by several factors, including seasonal weather patterns and overall economic climate. Local, regional, and national economic factors can impact the financial condition and operations of TEPs large industrial customers. Such economic conditions may directly impact energy consumption by large industrial customers and may indirectly impact residential and small commercial sales and revenues if employment levels and consumer spending change. In 2006, TEPs number of retail customers increased by 2% and total retail energy consumption increased by approximately 4%. The table below shows the percentage distribution of TEPs energy sales by major customer class over the last three years. 2006 2005 2004 Residential 41% 41% 40% Commercial 21% 21% 21% Non mining Industrial 25% 26% 26% Mining 10% 9% 10% Public Authority 3% 3% 3% TEP expects the number of its retail customers and retail energy consumption to increase 2 3% annually through 2010. The retail energy consumption by customer class through 2010 is expected to be similar to the 2006 distribution. In 2001, all of TEPs retail customers became eligible to choose an alternative energy service provider (ESP), however by 2002, none of TEPs retail customers were served by an alternate ESP. Certain portions of the Arizona Corporation Commissions (ACC) rules that enabled ESPs to compete in the retail market were invalidated by an Arizona Court of Appeals decision in 2005. Unless and until the ACC clarifies the competition rules and ESPs offer to provide energy in TEPs service area, it is not possible for TEPs retail customers to use other K 2 Table of Contents energy providers. Even if some of TEPs retail customers are, in the future, able to choose other energy providers, the forecasted customer growth rates referred to above would continue to apply to its distribution business. See Rates and Regulation, State, below. Wholesale Business TEPs electric utility operations include the wholesale marketing of electricity to other utilities and power marketers. Wholesale sales transactions are made on both a firm and interruptible basis. A firm contract requires TEP to supply power on demand (except under limited emergency circumstances), while an interruptible contract allows TEP to stop supplying power under defined conditions. See Purchases and Interconnections, below. TEP typically uses its own generation to serve the requirements of its retail and long term wholesale customers. Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected excess generating capability, forward prices and generation costs, using a diversified portfolio approach to provide a balance between long term, mid term and spot energy sales. When TEP expects to have excess coal generating capacity and energy (usually in the first, second and fourth calendar quarters), its wholesale sales consist primarily of two types of sales: (1) Sales under long term contracts for periods of more than one year. TEP currently has long term contracts with three entities to sell firm capacity and energy: Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRP), which will expire in May 2016, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, which expires in December 2009, and the Tohono Oodham Utility Authority, which expires in August 2009. (2) Short term sales. Under forward contracts, TEP commits to sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically for one month, three month or one year periods. Under short term sales, TEP sells energy in the daily or hourly markets at fluctuating spot market prices and makes other non firm energy sales. TEP participates in the wholesale energy markets, primarily by making sales and purchases in the short term and forward markets. Over the past three years, both the natural gas and the Western U.S. wholesale electricity markets experienced some price spikes and volatility due to severe winter weather, gas production and storage concerns and, in 2005, hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. TEP cannot predict, however, whether gas and wholesale electricity prices will remain volatile or how these prices will impact TEPs sales and revenues in the future. TEP expects the market price in the Western U.S. and the demand for capacity and energy to continue to be influenced by the following factors, among others: availability and price of natural gas; weather; continued population growth in the Western U.S.; economic conditions in the Western U.S.; availability of generation capacity throughout the Western U.S.; the extent of electric utility restructuring in Arizona, California and other Western states; FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets; availability of hydropower; transmission constraints; and environmental regulations and the cost of compliance. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, for additional discussion of TEPs wholesale marketing activities. K 3 Table of Contents GENERATING AND OTHER RESOURCES At December 31, 2006, TEP owned or leased 2,194 MW of net generating capability, as set forth in the following table: Net Unit Date Fuel Capability Operating TEPs Share Generating Source No. Location In Service Type MW Agent % MW Springerville Station(1) 1 Springerville, AZ 1985 Coal 380 TEP 100.0 380 Springerville Station 2 Springerville, AZ 1990 Coal 380 TEP 100.0 380 San Juan Station 1 Farmington, NM 1973 Coal 327 PNM 50.0 164 San Juan Station 2 Farmington, NM 1980 Coal 316 PNM 50.0 158 Navajo Station 1 Page, AZ 1974 Coal 750 SRP 7.5 56 Navajo Station 2 Page, AZ 1975 Coal 750 SRP 7.5 56 Navajo Station 3 Page, AZ 1976 Coal 750 SRP 7.5 56 Four Corners Station 4 Farmington, NM 1969 Coal 784 APS 7.0 55 Four Corners Station 5 Farmington, NM 1970 Coal 784 APS 7.0 55 Luna Energy Facility 1 Deming, NM 2006 Gas 570 PNM 33.0 190 Sundt Station 1 Tucson, AZ 1958 Gas/Oil 81 TEP 100.0 81 Sundt Station 2 Tucson, AZ 1960 Gas/Oil 81 TEP 100.0 81 Sundt Station 3 Tucson, AZ 1962 Gas/Oil 104 TEP 100.0 104 Sundt Station(1) 4 Tucson, AZ 1967 Coal/Gas 156 TEP 100.0 156 Internal Combustion Turbines Tucson, AZ 1972 Gas/Oil 122 TEP 100.0 122 Internal Combustion Turbines Tucson, AZ 2001 Gas 95 TEP 100.0 95 Solar Electric Generation Springerville/ Tucson, AZ 2002 2005 Solar 5 TEP 100.0 5 Total TEP Capacity (2) 2,194 (1) Leased assets. (2) Excludes 719 MW of additional resources, which consist of certain capacity purchases and interruptible retail load. At December 31, 2006, total owned capacity was 1,658 MW and leased capacity was 536 MW. Springerville Generating Station Springerville Unit 1 is leased by TEP. The Springerville Generating Station also includes the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and the Springerville Common Facilities. The terms of the Springerville Unit 1 Leases, which include a 50% interest in the Springerville Common Facilities, expire in 2015, but have optional fair market value renewal and purchase provisions. In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its remaining 50% interest in the Springerville Common Facilities. The terms of the Springerville Common Facilities Leases expire in 2017 and 2021, but have a fixed price purchase provision. In 1984, TEP sold and leased back the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities. The terms of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases expire in 2015, but have a fixed price purchase provision. Since entering into the Springerville leases, TEP has purchased a 14% equity ownership in the Springerville Unit 1 Leases and a 13% equity ownership in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases. Sundt Generating Station The Sundt Generating Station and the internal combustion turbines located in Tucson are designated as must run generation facilities. Must run generation units are required to run in certain circumstances to maintain distribution system reliability and to meet local load requirements. Sundt Unit 4 is leased by TEP. The terms of the Sundt Lease expire in 2011, but have optional fair market value renewal and purchase provisions. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt, Credit Facilities, and Capital Lease Obligations, and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, for more information regarding the Springerville and Sundt leases. K 4 Table of Contents Luna Energy Facility The Luna Energy Facility (Luna), located in southern New Mexico, is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was completed in April 2006. TEPs one third share of the plants capacity is 190 MW. Luna allows TEP to displace some of its less efficient gas fired generation and purchased power requirements and to make additional short term energy sales in the wholesale market. TEPs total investment of $49 million was funded with internal cash. Purchases and Interconnections TEP purchases power from other utilities and power marketers. TEP may enter into contracts: (a) to purchase energy under long term contracts to serve retail load and long term wholesale contracts, (b) to purchase capacity or energy during periods of planned outages or for peak summer load conditions, and (c) to purchase energy for resale to certain wholesale customers under load and resource management agreements. Finally, TEP may purchase energy in the daily and hourly markets to meet higher than anticipated demands, to cover unplanned generation outages, or when it is more economical than generating its own energy. TEP is a member of various regional reserve sharing, reliability and power sharing organizations. These relationships allow TEP to call upon other utilities during emergencies, such as plant outages and system disturbances, and reduce the amount of reserves TEP is required to carry. Springerville Units 3 and 4 In conjunction with the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station, TEP entered into a contract to purchase up to 100 MW of capacity of system resources from Tri State Generation and Transmission Association (Tri State), which leases 100% of the 400 MW Springerville Unit 3 from a financial owner. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Springerville Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired plant at the Springerville site. Under certain conditions, TEP would be required to purchase 100 MW of Unit 4 capacity from SRP. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Springerville Units 3 and 4. Peak Demand and Resources Peak Demand 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 MW Retail Customers Net One Hour 2,365 2,225 2,088 2,060 1,899 Firm Sales to Other Utilities 331 342 187 171 228 Coincident Peak Demand (A) 2,696 2,567 2,275 2,231 2,127 Total Generating Resources 2,194 2,004 2,004 2,003 2,002 Other Resources (1) 719 788 454 486 308 Total TEP Resources (B) 2,913 2,792 2,458 2,489 2,310 Total Margin (B) (A) 217 225 183 258 183 Reserve Margin (% of Coincident Peak Demand) 8 % 9 % 8 % 12 % 9 % (1) Other Resources include firm power purchases and interruptible retail and wholesale loads. Peak demand occurs during the summer months due to the cooling requirements of TEPs retail customers. Retail peak demand has grown at an average annual rate of approximately 6% from 2002 to 2006. The chart above shows the relationship over a five year period between TEPs peak demand and its energy resources. TEPs margin is the difference between total energy resources and coincident peak demand, and the reserve margin is the ratio of margin to coincident peak demand. TEP maintains a minimum reserve margin in excess of 7% to comply with reliability criteria set forth by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. TEPs actual reserve margin in 2006 was 8%. Forecasted retail peak demand for 2007 is approximately 2,476 MW, compared with actual peak demand of 2,365 MW in 2006. Except for certain peak hours during the summer, TEP believes it will have sufficient resources to meet expected demand in 2007 with its existing generation capacity and power purchase agreements. K 5 Table of Contents Future Generating Resources TEP will continue to add peaking resources to serve the Tucson area as needed based upon our forecasts of retail and firm wholesale load, as well as statewide transmission infrastructure. TEP currently forecasts that it may need additional peaking resources of 150 MW in 2015. FUEL SUPPLY Fuel Summary Fuel cost and usage information is provided below on a delivered to the boiler basis: Average Cost per MMBtu Percentage of Total Btu Consumed Consumed 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Coal $1.69 $1.69 $1.57 94% 96% 96% Gas $7.03 $8.09 $6.75 6% 4% 4% All Fuels $2.03 $1.93 $1.79 100% 100% 100% Coal TEPs principal fuel for electric generation is low sulfur, bituminous or sub bituminous coal from mines in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. The majority of its coal supplies are purchased under long term contracts, which result in more predictable prices. The average cost per ton of coal, including transportation for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $32.36, $32.43, and $30.20, respectively.

TEP Operated Generating Facilities TEP is the sole owner (or lessee) and operator of the Springerville Units 1 and 2 and Sundt Unit 4 Generating Stations. The coal supplies for the Springerville Units 1 and 2 are transported approximately 200 miles by railroad from Northwestern New Mexico. TEP expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. The coal supply agreement for Sundt Unit 4 expired on December 31, 2006. On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The coal supplies are transported approximately 1,300 miles by railroad from Colorado. The cost of coal and transportation under the new agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. TEP expects to pay approximately $20 million annually, compared with approximately $14 million annually under the old agreement, however the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. K 6 Table of Contents Generating Facilities Operated by Others TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan. These are mine mouth generating stations located adjacent to the coal reserves. The coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. Natural Gas Supply TEP typically uses generation from its facilities fueled by natural gas and purchased power, in addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchased power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs from the Permian Basin, and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. TEP entered into a Gas Procurement Agreement with Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG) in 2001, with a primary term of five years. Starting January 1, 2006, interim supply terms were put into place on a month to month basis until terminated by either party with 30 days notice and did not include a minimum volume obligation. SWG provided notice to TEP to terminate this agreement effective February 28, 2007. TEP is currently negotiating a new contract and tariff terms with SWG for supply to its Tucson gas plants starting March 1, 2007, as well as evaluating other supply options. TEP does not expect any gas supply disruptions to its plants. TEP purchased gas transportation for Luna from El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) from the Permian basin to the plant site. The initial term of this agreement is from February 2006 to January 2009, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. WATER SUPPLY The Four Corners region of New Mexico, where the San Juan and Four Corners Generating Stations are located, experienced drought conditions in 2002 through 2004 that could have affected the water supply for these plants. TEP has a 50% ownership interest in each of San Juan Units 1 and 2 (322 MW capacity) and a 7% ownership interest in each of Four Corners Units 4 and 5 (110 MW capacity). In future years, drought conditions may affect the water supply of the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area. The operating agents for San Juan and Four Corners have negotiated supplemental water contracts with BHP Billiton and the Jicarilla Apache Nation to assist the generating plants in meeting their water requirements in the event of a shortage. Drought conditions within the southwestern region, combined with increased water usage in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, have caused water levels to recede at Lake Powell, which supplies operating water for the Navajo Generating Station. TEP has a 7.5% ownership interest in Navajo Units 1, 2 and 3 (168 MW capacity). The operating agent for Navajo, along with the other plant owners, are evaluating options to ensure adequate water supply is available in the event drought conditions adversely affect the water level at Lake Powell. TRANSMISSION ACCESS TEP has transmission access and power transaction arrangements with over 120 electric systems or suppliers. TEP is taking steps to increase the capacity and reliability of its transmission and distribution system. In 2004, TEP completed a 500 kV connection that increased its energy import capability from the region, allowing TEP to decrease the use of its less efficient gas generating units in favor of more economical purchases of energy in the wholesale market. TEP also has various ongoing projects that are designed to increase access to the regional wholesale energy market and improve the reliability and efficiency of its existing transmission and distribution systems. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line TEP and UNS Electric are parties to a project development agreement for the joint construction of a 62 mile transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona. The project was initiated in response to an order by the ACC to improve reliability to UNS Electrics retail customers in Nogales, Arizona. K 7 Table of Contents In 2002, the ACC approved the location and construction of the proposed 345 kV transmission line along the Western Corridor route subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining all required permits from state and federal agencies. TEP is currently seeking approvals for the project from the Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The DOE has completed a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project in which it would accept any of the routes in the EIS but the U.S. Forest Service has indicated the Central route as its preferred alternative, rather than the Western Corridor route. Based on the alternative proposals and passage of time since it approved the location of the line, the ACC, in 2005, ordered TEP to review the status of electric service reliability in Nogales, Arizona and the need for the 345 kV transmission line. The ACC also indicated that it would review any new information regarding the location of the proposed transmission line. In 2005, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for the ACC issued a recommended opinion and order reaffirming the ACCs original position requiring the construction of the Tucson to Nogales transmission line. After a hearing on the issue in February 2006, the ACC directed the ALJ to amend the recommendation to direct the Line Siting Committee of the ACC to gather facts related to options for improving service reliability in Nogales, Arizona. TEP expects the ALJ to issue, and the ACC to address, an amended recommended opinion and order related to the Nogales transmission line in 2007. RATES AND REGULATION The FERC and the ACC regulate portions of TEPs utility accounting practices and electricity rates. The FERC regulates the terms and prices of TEPs transmission services and wholesale electricity sales. In 1996, TEP filed a tariff at FERC governing the rates, terms and conditions of open access transmission services. In 1997, TEP was granted a FERC tariff to sell power at market based rates. The ACC has authority over rates charged to retail customers, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. State Historically, the ACC determined TEPs rates for retail sales of electric energy on a cost of service basis, which was designed to provide, after recovery of allowable operating expenses, an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on TEPs fair value rate base. Fair value rate base was generally determined by reference to the original cost and the reconstruction cost (net of depreciation) of utility plant in service to the extent deemed used and useful, and to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items, plus a working capital component. Over time, additions to utility plant in service increased rate base and depreciation and retirements of utility plant reduced rate base. Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Retail Electric Competition Rules (Rules) that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Rates, for more information. Arizona Court of Appeals Decision Invalidating Certain Retail Electric Competition Rules In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. Based on this decision, we expect that the ACC will address the competition rules in an administrative proceeding. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules.

TEP believes that all existing facilities are in compliance and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. Federal Clean Air Act Amendments The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), through the Acid Rain Program, requires reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions; this affects all of TEPs generating facilities (except 142 MW of its internal combustion turbines). TEPs generating units affected by CAAA Phase II have been allocated SO2 Emission Allowances based on past operational history. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO2. Generating units subject to CAAA Phase II must hold Emission Allowances equal to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset excess emissions in future years. TEP has Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to comply with the CAAA Phase II SO2 regulations. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. Potential changes to the allocation of SO2 allowances may impact these expectations in future years. Title V of the CAAA requires that all of TEPs generating facilities obtain more stringent air quality permits. All TEP facilities (including those jointly owned and operated by others) have obtained these permits. TEP received a new Title V permit for the Springerville generating station in 2006. TEP expects that a new Title V permit will be issued for the Sundt generating station in 2007. Because TEP has submitted a permit renewal application for the Sundt facility, under its Title V permit, TEP can continue to operate the plant. TEP must pay an annual emission based fee for each generating facility subject to a Title V permit. These emission based fees are included in the CAAA compliance expenses discussed below. The CAAA also requires multi year studies of visibility impairment in specified areas and studies of hazardous air pollutants. The results of these studies will impact the development of future regulation of electric utility generating units. Mercury Emissions In 2005, the EPA adopted regulations relating to mercury emissions requiring states to develop rules for implementing federal requirements. Arizona adopted its mercury emission limits in 2007 and TEP must meet these limits by 2013. TEP is analyzing the potential impact of the Arizona regulations on its operations but does not expect the capital costs to exceed $5 million. TEP is also monitoring the New Mexico and Navajo Nation mercury emission regulations affecting plants for which TEP has an ownership share. Until these state procedures are adopted, TEP cannot determine if it will be significantly affected. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies are considering the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. At this time, we do not know whether any such regulations will be adopted, the scope of such regulations or how any such regulations could affect our operations. K 10 Table of Contents Regional Haze The EPAs Regional Haze Rule requires states to develop plans to restore visibility in Federal Class I Areas (such as parks, monuments and wilderness areas) to their natural conditions by 2064. State plans must be submitted to the EPA in December 2007, could require pollution control upgrades at some of TEPs power plants. The level of control required, if any, will not be known until the state plans are submitted and approved by EPA. If required, controls would need to be in place by 2013 or later. TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may reduce operating efficiency. State Regulations Arizona and New Mexico have adopted regulations restricting the emissions from existing and future coal, oil and gas fired plants. TEP believes that all existing generating facilities are in compliance with all existing state regulations. These regulations are in some instances more stringent than those adopted by the EPA. The principal generating units of TEP are located relatively close to national parks, monuments, wilderness areas and Indian reservations. These areas have relatively high air quality and TEP could be subject to control standards that relate to the prevention of significant deterioration of visibility and tall stack limitation rules. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Contingencies, Litigation and Claims Related to San Juan Generating Station. In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate 15% of their total energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025. To offset the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the REST rules allow a change in the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, TEP, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, for more information. Capital and Operating Costs TEP capitalized $1 million in 2006, $1 million in 2005 and $9 million in 2004 in construction costs to comply with environmental requirements and expects to capitalize $18 million in 2007 and $42 million in 2008. The increase in environmental capital expenditures in 2007 and 2008 is due primarily to pollution control upgrades to be made at San Juan. TEP recorded expenses of $10 million in 2006, $11 million in 2005 and $9 million in 2004 related to environmental compliance, including the cost of lime used to scrub the stack gas. TEP expects environmental expenses to be $11 million in 2007. TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may result in a reduction in operating efficiency. In order to meet Title V permit requirements in connection with the construction of Springerville Unit 3, the Unit 3 project paid approximately $90 million for upgrades to pollution control equipment on Springerville Units 1 and 2 and common facilities. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, Resolution of Springerville Generating Station Complaint. UNS GAS SERVICE TERRITORY AND CUSTOMERS UNS Gas is a gas distribution company serving approximately 145,000 retail customers in Mohave, Yavapai, Coconino, and Navajo counties in Northern Arizona, as well as Santa Cruz County in Southeast Arizona. These counties comprise approximately 50% of the territory in the state of Arizona, with a population of approximately 773,000 in 2006. UNS Gas customer base is primarily residential. Total revenues derived from residential customers were approximately 61% in 2006, while sales to other retail customer classes accounted for approximately 30% of total revenues. Approximately 9% of total revenues in 2006 were derived from gas transportation services and a Negotiated Sales Program (NSP). UNS Gas supplies natural gas transportation service to the 600 MW Griffith Power Plant located near Kingman, Arizona, under a 20 year contract which expires in 2021. UNS Gas also supplies natural gas to some of its large transportation customers through an NSP approved by the ACC. One half K 11 Table of Contents of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas, while the other half benefits retail customers through a credit to the purchased gas adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. GAS SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005, but the agreement automatically extends for one year on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. The market price for gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the period during which the commodity is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas buys most of the gas it distributes from the San Juan Basin in the Four Corners region. The gas is delivered on the El Paso and Transwestern interstate pipeline systems. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its customers demands. With EPNG, the average daily capacity right of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March) to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, UNS Gas Supply Contracts, for more information. RATES AND REGULATION The ACC regulates UNS Gas with respect to retail gas rates, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. UNS Gas retail gas rates include a monthly customer charge, a base rate charge for delivery services and the cost of gas (expressed in cents per therm), and a PGA. Purchased Gas Adjustor The PGA mechanism is intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or returned to customers through the PGA mechanism. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, for more information. General Rate Case In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case to recover the costs related to serving its growing customer base. UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Rates, for more information. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS UNS Gas is subject to environmental regulation of air and water quality, resource extraction, waste disposal and land use by federal, state and local authorities. UNS Gas believes that all existing facilities are in compliance with all existing regulations and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. K 12 Table of Contents UNS ELECTRIC SERVICE TERRITORY AND CUSTOMERS UNS Electric is an electric transmission and distribution company serving approximately 93,000 retail customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz Counties. These counties had a population of approximately 240,000 in 2006. UNS Electrics customer base is primarily residential, with some small commercial and both light and heavy industrial customers. Peak demand for 2006 was 417 MW. POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION Power Supply UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT) which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric owns and operates the Valencia Power Plant (Valencia), located in Nogales, Arizona. Valencia consists of four gas and diesel fueled combustion turbine units and provides approximately 68 MW of peaking resources. This includes a 20 MW unit installed in 2006. The facility is directly interconnected with the distribution system serving the city of Nogales and the surrounding areas. Under the PWMT agreement, Valencia will be dispatched by PWMT when needed for local reliability or when it is economic relative to other PWMT resources. Transmission UNS Electric imports the power it purchases from PWMT into its Mohave County and Santa Cruz County service territories over Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electric is currently negotiating a network transmission service agreement to replace its primary transmission capacity agreement with WAPA for the Parker Davis system that expires in February 2008. The new agreement is expected to have no expiration date and be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2007. UNS Electric also has a long term electric point to point transmission capacity agreement with WAPA for the Southwest Intertie system that expires in 2011. UNS Electric plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time to improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County. Future Power Supply UNS Electric is in the process of evaluating and securing power supply resources to ensure adequate resources are in place when its PWMT agreement expires in May 2008. In 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods for one to five years beginning in June 2008. In addition, as part of its general rate case filing, UNS Electric included a proposal to purchase the 90 MW Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS) in 2008, which is under development by UED. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had 28% of its total expected resource needs for June 2008; this includes purchased power contracts as well as generating assets. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations and Other, UED, below for more information. RATES AND REGULATION UNS Electric is regulated by the ACC with respect to retail electric rates, quality of service, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties, and by the FERC with respect to wholesale power contracts and interstate transmission service. UNS Electrics retail electric rates include a purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC), which allows for UNS Electric to recover the actual costs of its power purchases. General Rate Case In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case to recover the costs related to serving its growing customer base. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Electric, Rates, for more information. K 13 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS UNS Electric is subject to environmental regulation of air and water quality, resource extraction, waste disposal and land use by federal, state and local authorities. UNS Electric believes that all existing facilities are in compliance with all existing regulations and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. Like TEP, UNS Electric is subject to the ACCs REST rules. See TEP Electric Utility Operations, Environmental Matters, State Regulation, above. OTHER UED UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the 90 MW gas fired BMGS in Kingman, Arizona. In October 2006, UED purchased two electric generating gas turbines that will be part of the BMGS. Completion of the project is estimated to occur in May 2008. Pending ACC approval, BMGS is expected to be used as a resource for UNS Electric. Millennium Investments Through affiliates, Millennium holds investments in unregulated energy and emerging technology companies. At December 31, 2006, Millenniums assets represented 3% of UniSource Energys total assets. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding for Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Other, Liquidity and Capital Resources. Consolidated Millennium Investments Southwest Energy Solutions, Inc. (SES), a wholly owned Millennium subsidiary, provides electrical contracting services in Arizona to commercial, industrial and governmental customers in both high voltage and inside wiring capacities. SES also provides meter reading services to TEP and UNS Electric. Millennium Environmental Group, Inc.

Information contained at UniSource Energys website is not part of any report filed with the SEC by UniSource Energy or TEP. K 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The business and financial results of UniSource Energy and TEP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and in other documents we file with the SEC. Regulatory and other restrictions limit the ability of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to make distributions to UniSource Energy. UniSource Energy is a holding company that is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from its subsidiaries to service its debt and pay dividends to shareholders. Restrictions include: TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are restricted from lending or transferring funds or issuing securities without ACC approval; The Federal Power Act restricts electric utilities ability to pay dividends out of funds that are properly included in their capital account. TEP has an accumulated deficit rather than positive retained earnings. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe there is a reasonable basis for TEP to pay dividends from current year earnings. However, the FERC could attempt to stop TEP from paying further dividends or could seek to impose additional restrictions on the payment of dividends; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric must be in compliance with their respective debt agreements to make dividend payments to UniSource Energy. UniSource Energy does not expect to receive distributions from UNS Gas or UNS Electric before 2008 due to the need to apply internally generated funds to the growth of these businesses. TEPs retail rates are capped through 2008, which could negatively impact TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEPs current retail rates were established under a Settlement Agreement approved by the ACC in 1999. Under the Settlement Agreement, TEPs rates are capped until December 31, 2008. Operational failures or unscheduled outages at TEPs generating stations, especially during peak seasons, could result in unanticipated power purchases which could significantly increase the cost of serving TEPs retail load. Operational failures or damage to TEPs facilities, from storms or other events, could result in increased operating and capital expenses. In the event that any power purchase, natural gas or coal costs, operation and maintenance or other expenses increase, TEP could be adversely affected unless it were able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs with other cost reductions or increases in income and cash flow or otherwise seek rate recovery of such increased costs under emergency provisions of the Settlement Agreement. TEP may not be able to recover such costs. Uncertainty exists as to what methodology the ACC will use to set TEPs retail rates after December 31, 2008, which could negatively impact TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. There is disagreement between the participants in TEPs regulatory proceedings about what is to happen to the rates TEP charges for generation service after December 31, 2008. TEP believes the Settlement Agreement requires it to charge market based generation service rates while other participants, including ACC staff, disagree. The Settlement Agreement also requires TEP to record and amortize a $450 million transition recovery asset (TRA) and collect the balance from customers though a Fixed Competition Transition Charge (Fixed CTC). Based on current projections of retail sales, the TRA is expected to be fully amortized by mid 2008. The Fixed CTC currently produces revenues of slightly less than one cent per kWh sold, or approximately $90 million annually. If TEP is required to reduce its retail rates by the amount of the Fixed CTC, and is not allowed to charge market rates for its generation services or to adjust other rate components to reflect a higher cost of service, TEPs retail revenues will decrease approximately 12% relative to 2006 revenues from current retail rates. K 16 Table of Contents Restrictions on rate increases and the ability to recover fuel costs at UNS Gas could negatively impact its liquidity, cash flows and net income. UNS Gas filed a general rate case in July 2006. Under the terms of an ACC order, any resulting rate increase may not become effective until August 1, 2007. UNS Gas is subject to operational risks, including operational failures or damage to facilities which could result in unplanned operation, maintenance and capital expenditures. UNS Gas could be adversely affected unless it was able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs. UNS Gas has an automatic gas price adjustment mechanism, known as the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA), through which increases or decreases in the cost of gas can be passed on to customers. The PGA is subject to a cap on how much the factor can change in a 12 month period and anything above the cap must be approved by the ACC. In 2006, the cost of gas represented more than 77% of UNS Gas total operating costs. Natural gas prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose UNS Gas to commodity price risks to the extent they cannot be collected from customers in a timely manner. If UNS Gas is unable to recover its fuel costs or other costs of providing service in a timely manner, its liquidity could be adversely affected and it may be more difficult for UNS Gas to satisfy its obligations, including purchasing and paying for gas. In addition, it may be more difficult for UNS Gas to comply with the obligations and restrictive covenants of its debt agreements, which limit its ability to borrow money, and could result in an event of default. Restrictions on rate increases and the ability to recover purchased power and fuel costs at UNS Electric could negatively impact its liquidity, cash flows and net income. UNS Electric filed a general rate case in December 2006. Under the terms of an ACC order, any resulting rate increase may not become effective until August 1, 2007. Operational failures or damage to UNS Electrics facilities from storms or other events could result in increased operating and capital expenditures. UNS Electric could be adversely affected unless it was able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs. The expiration of UNS Electrics power supply agreement will require UNS Electric to find alternate sources for its energy needs, which may not be recovered through rates. UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement for 100% of its customers energy needs that expires May 2008. UNS Electric pays a fixed price per MWh for the power it purchases under the agreement. In 2006, UNS Electric sold approximately 1.6 million MWh to its retail customers. In 2008, UNS Electric will need a replacement source of energy for its customer base, which grew at 4% in 2006. UNS Electric has a purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) through which increases or decreases in the cost of power and fuel can be passed on to customers. The cost of UNS Electrics existing power supply agreement is being fully recovered through the PPFAC. The ACC must approve any change to the PPFAC. UNS Electric may be required to post margin under its power supply agreements which could negatively impact its liquidity. UNS Electric is in the process of evaluating and securing power supply resourced to replace the full requirements power supply agreement which expires in May 2008. The agreements under which UNS Electric contracts for such resources include requirements to post credit enhancement in the form of cash or letters of credit under certain circumstances, including changes in market prices which affect contract values, or a change in the creditworthiness of UNS Electric. In order to post such credit enhancement, UNS Electric would have to use available cash, draw under its revolving credit agreement, or issue letters of credit under its revolving credit agreement. As of February 23, 2007, the maximum amount that UNS Electric may use under its revolving credit facility is $30 million (to be increased to $45 million upon approval of a matter pending before the ACC). K 17 Table of Contents TEPs, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics revenues, results of operations and cash flows are seasonal, and are subject to weather conditions, economic conditions and customer usage patterns, which are beyond the Companys control. TEP typically earns the majority of its operating revenue and net income in the third quarter because of higher air conditioning usage by its retail customers due to hot summer weather. Furthermore, TEP typically reports limited net income in the first quarter because of relatively mild winter weather in its retail service territory. UNS Gas peak sales occur in the winter; UNS Electrics peak sales occur in the summer. Cool summers or warm winters may adversely affect the utility subsidiaries operating revenues and net income by reducing sales. Changes in federal energy regulation may affect TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are subject to comprehensive and changing governmental regulation at the federal level that continues to change the structure of the electric and gas utility industries and the ways in which these industries are regulated. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission in interstate commerce and rates for wholesale sales of electric power, including terms and prices of transmission services and sales of electricity at wholesale prices. Deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may result in increased competition resulting in an erosion of TEP and UNS Electrics retail customer base and a reduction in TEPs wholesale revenues. In 1999, the ACC approved rules providing a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona. As a result of the energy crisis in California in 2000 and 2001 and the volatility of natural gas prices, the competitive retail market in Arizona that was anticipated in 1999 did not materialize. In addition, a 2005 Arizona Court of Appeals ruling held certain portions of the ACCs retail competition rules invalid. Currently, none of TEP or UNS Electrics customers are receiving energy from other providers; however we cannot predict if retail competition will enter the Arizona market. Competition in wholesale markets has greatly escalated due to increased participation by utilities, non utility generators, independent power producers and other wholesale power marketers and brokers. Since 2001, electric generating capacity in Arizona has increased 61% to 25,600 MW, of which approximately 9,700 MW is from gas fired generators. Increased competition combined with increased supply and fewer creditworthy counterparties could reduce the prices at which TEP sells electricity in the wholesale market. In 2006, TEPs wholesale revenues were $188 million or 19% of TEPs total revenues. UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and results of operations. UniSource Energy has no operations of its own and derives all of its revenues and cash flow from its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, total debt (including capital lease obligations) to total capitalization for UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries was 72%. The substantial amount of indebtedness of UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries could: require UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to pay principal and interest on its debt, which could reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; make UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries more vulnerable to restrictions imposed by new governmental regulations as well as changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its business strategy or other purposes; limit the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to UniSource Energy; and make it more difficult for UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations of its debt instruments, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements. K 18 Table of Contents The terms of UniSource Energys and its subsidiaries existing debt instruments and future debt instruments may restrict UniSource Energys current and future operations, particularly the ability to respond to changes in its business or to take certain actions. The UniSource Energy Credit Agreement, the TEP Credit Agreement and other existing debt instruments contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on UniSource Energy, including restrictions on the ability to engage in acts that may be in UniSource Energys best long term interests. The TEP Credit Agreement includes financial covenants, including requirements to maintain certain minimum cash coverage ratios and not to exceed certain maximum total leverage ratios. The UniSource Credit Agreement contains similar financial covenants. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in UniSource Energys and its subsidiaries existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect UniSource Energys ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The cost of renewing or purchasing TEPs leased assets, or the cost of procuring alternate sources of generation or purchased power, could adversely affect TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEP, under separate sale and leaseback arrangements, leases the following generation facilities: Springerville Unit 1; Sundt Unit 4; Springerville Coal Handling Facilities; and Springerville Common Facilities. . TEP may renew the leases or purchase the assets when the leases expire at various times between 2011 and 2021. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, whereas fixed purchase price options exist for the coal handling and common facilities leases. Upon expiration of the coal handling and common facilities leases (whether at the end of the initial term or any renewal term), TEP has the obligation under agreements with the Springerville Units 3 and 4 owners to purchase such facilities, and the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 14% and 17% interest, respectively, in these facilities. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations which may increase their cost of operations or expose them to environmentally related litigation and liabilities. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental regulations affecting present and future operations, including regulations regarding air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. Many of these regulations arise from TEPs use of coal as the primary fuel for energy generation. Existing environmental regulations may be revised or new regulations may be adopted or become applicable to UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. The U.S. Congress is considering the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. At this time, we do not know whether any such regulations will be adopted, the scope of such regulations or how any such regulations could affect our operations. TEP is also contractually obligated to pay a portion of its environmental reclamation costs at generating stations in which it has a minority interest and possibly at the mines that supply these generating stations. While TEP has recorded the portion of its costs that can be determined at this time, the total costs for final reclamation at these sites are unknown and could be substantial. TEP may be required to redeem significant amounts of its outstanding tax exempt bonds. TEP has financed a portion of its utility plant assets with tax exempt bonds for which the exemption from income taxes requires that the financed facilities be used for the local furnishing of electric energy. Approximately $359 million of these bonds were outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Various events, including, in certain K 19 Table of Contents circumstances, the formation of an RTO or an independent system operator, asset divestitures, changes in tax laws or changes in system operations, could require TEP to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds which would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater principal amount. TEP may not be permitted to construct a Tucson to Nogales transmission line and TEP or UNS Electric may be required to find alternate ways to improve reliability in UNS Electrics Santa Cruz service area. In 2001, TEP entered into an agreement to build an approximately 60 mile transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona, in response to an order from the ACC to improve reliability to UNS Electrics retail customers in Nogales. Required regulatory approvals have delayed the construction of the transmission line, and in 2005, the ACC initiated proceedings to review the status of service in Nogales and need for the 345 kV line. If TEP does not receive required approvals or if we abandon the project, it may be required to expense a portion of the $11 million it has incurred through December 31, 2006, in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses. In such an event, TEP or UNS Electric may be required to make additional expenditures to improve reliability. In the event TEP or UNS Electric are not able to recover such expenditures, their results of operations and net income could be adversely affected. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES TEP PROPERTIES TEPs transmission facilities, located in Arizona and New Mexico, transmit electricity from TEPs remote electric generating stations at Four Corners, Navajo, San Juan, Springerville and Luna to the Tucson area for use by TEPs retail customers (see Item 1. Business Generating and Other Resources). The transmission system is interconnected at various points in Arizona and New Mexico with a number of regional utilities. TEP has arrangements with approximately 120 companies to interchange generation capacity and transmission of energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP owned or participated in an overhead electric transmission and distribution system consisting of: 512 circuit miles of 500 kV lines; 1,098 circuit miles of 345 kV lines; 365 circuit miles of 138 kV lines; 437 circuit miles of 46 kV lines; and 2,631 circuit miles of lower voltage primary lines. The underground electric distribution system is comprised of 4,201 cable miles. TEP owns approximately 60% of the poles on which the lower voltage lines are located. Electric substation capacity consisted of 101 substations with a total installed transformer capacity of 6,738,947 kilovolt amperes. Substantially all of the utility assets owned by TEP are subject to the lien of the 1992 Mortgage. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos Resources Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of TEP (San Carlos), is not subject to the lien. The electric generating stations (except as noted below), operating headquarters, warehouse and service center are located on land owned by TEP. The electric distribution and transmission facilities owned by TEP are located: on property owned by TEP; under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state lands under franchises, easements or other rights which are generally subject to termination; under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the record holder of title; or over American Indian reservations under grant of easement by the Secretary of Interior or lease by American Indian tribes. It is possible that some of the easements, and the property over which the easements were granted, may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired. K 20 Table of Contents Springerville is located on land parcels held by TEP under a long term surface ownership agreement with the State of Arizona. Four Corners and Navajo are located on properties held under easements from the United States and under leases from the Navajo Nation, respectively. TEP, individually and in conjunction with PNM in connection with San Juan, has acquired easements and leases for transmission lines and a water diversion facility located on land owned by the Navajo Nation. TEP has also acquired easements for transmission facilities, related to San Juan, Four Corners, and Navajo, across the Zuni, Navajo and Tohono Oodham Indian Reservations. TEP, in conjunction with PNM and Phelps Dodge, holds an undivided ownership interest in the property on which Luna is located. TEPs rights under these various easements and leases may be subject to defects such as: possible conflicting grants or encumbrances due to the absence of or inadequacies in the recording laws or record systems of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the American Indian tribes; possible inability of TEP to legally enforce its rights against adverse claimants and the American Indian tribes without Congressional consent; or failure or inability of the American Indian tribes to protect TEPs interests in the easements and leases from disruption by the U.S. Congress, Secretary of the Interior, or other adverse claimants. These possible defects have not interfered and are not expected to materially interfere with TEPs interest in and operation of its facilities. TEP, under separate sale and leaseback arrangements, leases the following generation facilities (which do not include land): coal handling facilities at Springerville; a 50% undivided interest in the Springerville Common Facilities; Springerville Unit 1 and the remaining 50% undivided interest in the Springerville Common Facilities; and Sundt Unit 4 and related common facilities.

UES PROPERTIES UNS Gas As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas transmission and distribution system consisted of approximately 78 miles of steel transmission mains, 4,223 miles of steel and plastic distribution mains, and 148,432 customer service lines. UNS Electric As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electrics transmission and distribution system consisted of approximately 56 circuit miles of 115 kV transmission lines, 236 circuit miles of 69 kV transmission lines, and 3,432 circuit miles of underground and overhead distribution lines. UNS Electric also owns 39 substations having a total installed capacity of 1,641,250 kilovolt amperes and the 65 MW Valencia plant. The gas and electric distribution and transmission facilities owned by UNS Gas and UNS Electric are located: on property owned by UNS Gas or UNS Electric; under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state lands under franchises, easements or other rights which are generally subject to termination; or under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the record holder of title. It is possible that some of the easements, and the property over which the easements were granted, may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired. K 21 Table of Contents ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Operations, for litigation related to ACC orders and retail competition. We discuss other legal proceedings in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. City of Tacoma In June 2004, the City of Tacoma, Washington filed a lawsuit (City of Tacoma v. American Electric Power Services Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Ct. W.D. Wash.)) against TEP and various other electricity generators and marketers alleging that the defendants violated antitrust laws by colluding to affect the price of electricity in the Pacific Northwest from May 2000 through 2001. In September 2004, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. TEP, along with other defendants, filed a joint motion to dismiss, which was granted on February 11, 2005. The City of Tacoma appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit and the appeal is now pending. TEP believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest them. ITEM 4.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. NON GAAP MEASURES Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change which is a non cash item. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is presented here as a measure of liquidity because it can be used as an indication of a companys ability to incur and service debt and is commonly used as an analytical indicator in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and we do not intend Adjusted EBITDA to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered to be an alternative to cash flows from operations or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP or an indicator of our operating performance. UniSource Energy and TEP believe Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors as a measure of liquidity. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

We have subtracted investment in lease debt because it represents TEPs ownership of the debt component of its own capital lease obligations. Net Debt measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Net Debt is not a measurement presented in accordance with GAAP and we do not intend Net Debt to represent debt as defined by GAAP. You should not consider Net Debt to be an alternative to debt or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe Net Debt, which is a non GAAP measure, provides useful information to investors as a measure of TEPs debt and capital lease obligations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis explains the results of operations, the general financial condition, and the outlook for UniSource Energy and its three primary business segments and includes the following: outlook and strategies, operating results during 2006 compared with 2005, and 2005 compared with 2004, factors which affect our results and outlook, liquidity, capital needs, capital resources, and contractual obligations, dividends, and critical accounting estimates. UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns the outstanding common stock of TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. (UES), Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. (Millennium), and UniSource Energy Development Company (UED). TEP, an electric utility, has provided electric service to the community of Tucson, Arizona, for over 100 years. UES was established in 2003, when it acquired the Arizona gas and electric properties from Citizens. UES, through its two operating subsidiaries, UNS Gas, Inc. (UNS Gas) and UNS Electric, Inc. (UNS Electric), provides gas and electric service to 30 communities in Northern and Southern Arizona. Millennium has existing investments in unregulated businesses; however no new investments are planned at Millennium. UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS), a gas turbine project in Northern Arizona that, subject to approval, is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. We conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold its interest in Global Solar Energy, Inc. (Global Solar), its largest holding. At December 31, 2006, the investment in Millennium represented 3% of UniSource Energys Total Assets. UNISOURCE ENERGY CONSOLIDATED OUTLOOK AND STRATEGIES Our financial prospects and outlook for the next few years will be affected by many competitive, regulatory and economic factors. Our plans and strategies include the following: Efficiently manage our generation, transmission and distribution resources and seek ways to control our operating expenses while maintaining and enhancing reliability and profitability; Expand TEPs portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand and respond to wholesale market opportunities; Expand UNS Electrics portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand upon the expiration of the full requirements contract with PWMT; Resolve the uncertainty surrounding TEPs rates for generation service after 2008, while preserving TEPs benefits under the Settlement Agreement; Receive ACC approval of rate increases for UNS Gas and UNS Electric to provide adequate revenues to cover the rising cost of providing service to their customers; Enhance the value of existing generation assets by working with Salt River Project to support the construction of Springerville Unit 4; Enhance the value of TEPs transmission system while continuing to provide reliable access to generation for TEP and UNS Electrics retail customers and market access for all generating assets; K 29 Table of Contents Continue to develop synergies between UNS Gas,UNS Electric and TEP; Improve capital structure; and Promote economic development in our service territories. To accomplish our goals, during 2007 we expect to spend the following on capital expenditures: Segment Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 UNS Gas 38 UNS Electric 43 Other (1) 27 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 (1) Represents capital expenditures by UED related to the 90 MW BMGS to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, in UNS Electrics service area. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. While we believe that our plans and strategies will continue to have a positive impact on our financial prospects and position, we recognize that we continue to be highly leveraged, and as a result, our access to the capital markets may be limited or more expensive than for less leveraged companies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview UniSource Energy recorded Income Before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change of $69 million in 2006, $52 million in 2005 and $51 million in 2004. Net Income of $67 million in 2006 includes a $2 million loss from discontinued operations; net income of $46 million in 2005 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations and a $1 million loss from the cumulative effect of an accounting change; and net income of $46 million in 2004 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations. 2006 Compared With 2005 The improvement in UniSource Energys results in 2006 is due primarily to: the higher availability of TEPs coal fired generating plants; the start of commercial operations at Luna in April 2006; retail customer growth at TEP; interest savings related to various financing activities in 2005 and 2006; and the commencement of commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in August 2006. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below, and Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, below. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold Global Solar for $16 million in cash and an option to purchase, under certain conditions, 5% to 10% of Global Solar in the future. In 2006, UniSource Energy recorded an after tax loss of approximately $2 million related to the discontinued operations and disposal of Global Solar. See Other Non Reportable Segments, Results of Operations, Discontinued Operations Global Solar, below. 2005 Compared With 2004 UniSource Energys results in 2005 were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned outages at several of TEPs coal plants. One of TEPs largest coal plants suffered a nearly month long outage in August 2005, during a period when customer demand was high and energy prices were boosted by the impact of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher natural gas prices and the cost of purchasing replacement power during the outage contributed to an 82% increase in TEPs purchased power expense. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below. Also in 2005, UniSource Energy completed a financial restructuring, issuing $240 million of debt and using the proceeds to repay an inter company note and infuse capital into its subsidiaries. TEP retired approximately $321 million of debt and capital lease obligations (net of proceeds received from TEPs investment in lease debt).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES UniSource Energy Consolidated Cash Flows 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Cash provided by (used in): Operating Activities $ 283 $ 274 $ 307 Investing Activities (246 ) (170 ) (156 ) Financing Activities (77 ) (113 ) (98 ) UniSource Energys consolidated cash flows are provided primarily from retail and wholesale energy sales at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, net of the related payments for fuel and purchased power. Generally, cash from operations is lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. We use our available cash primarily to: fund capital expenditures at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric; pay dividends to shareholders; and reduce leverage. The primary source of liquidity for UniSource Energy, the parent company, is dividends it receives from its subsidiaries, primarily TEP. Also, under our tax sharing agreement, our subsidiaries make income tax payments to UniSource Energy, which makes payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The table below provides a summary of the liquidity position of UniSource Energy on a stand alone basis and each of its segments. K 31 Table of Contents Balances As of February 23, 2007 Cash and Cash Equivalents Borrowings under Revolving Credit Facility Amount Available under Revolving Credit Facility Millions of Dollars UniSource Energy stand alone $ 13 $ $ 70 TEP 48 90 60 UNS Gas 16 30(1) UNS Electric 4 25 5(1) Other 31(2) NA NA Total $ 112 (1) Currently, either UNS Gas or UNS Electric may borrow up to a maximum of $30 million, but the total combined amount borrowed cannot exceed $40 million. Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. (2) Includes cash and cash equivalents at Millennium. Executive Overview Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities were $283 million or $9 million higher than 2005. The increase is due primarily to: an increase in TEPs cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs; higher UNS Gas retail revenues; and the wind down of activity at MEG; partially offset by a $32 million payment made to the IRS and state tax authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $76 million higher in 2006 primarily due to: TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease; growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; utility system growth at UNS Gas and UNS Electric; the purchase of two gas turbines by UED; and TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna. Forecasted Capital Expenditures Business Segment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 293 UNS Gas 38 33 27 28 26 UNS Electric 43 39 42 28 34 Other 27 10 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 $ 320 $ 264 $ 280 $ 353 Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $331 million, or 39% higher than forecasted amounts reported in 2006. This increase is the result of several factors including: higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; generation needs for UNS Electric; and continued strong customer growth in UniSource Energys utility service territories. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities were $36 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors impacting cash used for financing activities in 2006 include: an increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings and lower debt issuance costs; partially offset by an increase in net repayments of long term debt; higher payments on capital lease obligations by TEP; higher dividends paid by UniSource Energy to its shareholders. In 2005, UniSource Energy issued $240 million of debt, which it used to repay an inter company note to TEP and infuse K 32 Table of Contents capital into its subsidiaries. TEP used the proceeds from the inter company note repayment and capital infusion to retire $282 million of debt. As a result of the activities described above, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased to $104 million at December 31, 2006, from $145 million at December 31, 2005. We invest cash balances in high grade money market securities with an emphasis on preserving the principal amounts invested. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures at UniSource Energys subsidiaries, the revolving credit facilities at UniSource Energy, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may be used on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements of the strong utility customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt, as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy to its subsidiaries. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of rate related proceedings at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. For more information concerning liquidity and capital resources, see Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Other Non Reportable Segments, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. Convertible Senior Notes In March 2005, UniSource Energy issued $150 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, which are unsecured and are not guaranteed by TEP or any other UniSource Energy subsidiary. Each $1,000 of Convertible Senior Notes is convertible into 26.6667 shares of our Common Stock at any time, representing a conversion price of approximately $37.50 per share of our Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Beginning in March 2010, UniSource Energy will have the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, for cash, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the notes will have the right to require UniSource Energy to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, for cash on March 1, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or if certain specified fundamental changes involving UniSource Energy occur. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a fundamental change that occurs prior to March 2010, UniSource Energy may be required to pay a make whole premium on notes converted in connection with the fundamental change. The make whole premium will be payable in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock or the consideration into which UniSource Energy Common Stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with such fundamental change. A fundamental change involving UniSource Energy will be deemed to have occurred if: (1) certain transactions occur as a result of which there is a change in control of UniSource Energy; or (2) UniSource Energy Common Stock ceases to be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq National Market or another established automated over the counter trading market in the United States. The notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes. The failure to make required payments on the notes or comply with the terms of the indenture may constitute an event of default. In addition, events of default may arise upon the acceleration of $50 million of indebtedness for borrowed money of UniSource Energy or TEP, or certain events of bankruptcy involving UniSource Energy or TEP. UniSource Energy Credit Agreement In August 2006, UniSource Energy amended and restated its existing credit agreement (UniSource Credit Agreement). The amendment extended the maturity from April 2010 to August 2011, reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings, and changed the amounts available under the term loan and the revolving credit facilities. As amended, the UniSource Credit Agreement consists of a $30 million term loan facility and a $70 million revolving credit facility. Prior to the amendment, the UniSource Credit Agreement included a $90 million term loan facility ($84 million outstanding) and a $15 million revolving credit facility (zero outstanding). On August 11, 2006, UniSource Energy repaid the $84 million outstanding term loan with $30 million of available cash, $30 million drawn under the new term loan and $24 million drawn under the revolving credit facility. K 33 Table of Contents Quarterly principal payments of $1.5 million on the outstanding term loan are due beginning in September 2006, with the balance due at maturity. At December 31, 2006, there was $27 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $20 million outstanding under the UniSource Energy revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 6.67%. In January 2007, UniSource Energy repaid the $20 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. We have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 1.25% or the sum of the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate and 0.25%. The UniSource Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of assets, and certain investments and acquisitions. We must also meet: (1) a minimum cash flow to debt service coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a standalone basis and (2) a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. We may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, we have more than $15 million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving credit. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the terms of the UniSource Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the UniSource Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UniSource Credit Agreement, failure of UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million, or certain bankruptcy events at UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries. Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. We entered into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness of a subsidiary on a stand alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees at December 31, 2006 were: UES guarantee of $160 million of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas and UNS Electric to purchase the Citizens Arizona gas and electric system assets; UES guarantee of a $40 million revolving credit facility available to UNS Gas and UNS Electric; and UniSource Energys guarantee of approximately $5 million in natural gas and supply payments and building lease payments for UNS Gas and UNS Electric. To the extent liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have indemnified the purchasers of interests in certain investments from additional taxes due for years prior to the sale. The terms of the indemnifications provide for no limitation on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided by all tax laws and paid all tax obligations. We have not made any payments under the terms of these indemnifications to date. We believe that the likelihood that UniSource Energy would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. K 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following charts display UniSource Energys consolidated contractual obligations by maturity and by type of obligation as of December 31, 2006.

TEPs Variable Rate IDBs are backed by LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August 2011. Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022, the above maturity reflects a redemption or repurchase of such bonds in 2011 as though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit Agreement. (2) Includes letter of credit and remarketing fees on variable rate debt. The interest rates for variable rate debt are estimated using Eurodollar futures rates for an approximation of LIBOR. For variable rate IDBs, a discount is applied to estimated LIBOR based on the historical discount the IDBs have had to LIBOR. (3) Beginning with commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in September 2006, Tri State is reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the common facilities on an ongoing basis, including 14% of the Springerville Common Lease payments and 17% of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments. Similar reimbursement obligations are required after Unit 4 is constructed. TEP remains the obligor under these capital leases. Capital Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction associated with this reimbursement. (4) Annual payments under the Springerville Unit 1 lease vary in accordance with the amortization schedules of the debt underlying the capital lease, with significantly larger principal payments occurring in 2007, 2008 and 2011. (5) Purchase obligations reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. The total amount paid under these contracts depends on the quantity purchased and transported. TEP and UES requirements are expected to be in excess of K 35 Table of Contents these minimums. UniSource Energy has excluded open purchase orders of approximately $13 million expected to be fulfilled in 2007. (6) Based on prior years expenditures, TEP expects to spend approximately $200 million annually for the purchase and transportation of coal through 2010. TEP is unable to estimate how much it will spend under these contracts beyond 2010 due to the impact of the amended Springerville coal contract. (7) Includes TEP and UNS Electrics forward power purchases. TEP has not included capacity payments under TEPs purchased power agreement with Tri State which may be reduced in increments of 25 MW with 90 days notice. To date, TEP has received no such notice. If Tri State does not give notice to reduce capacity, the minimum capacity payments will be $31 million annually in 2007 through 2010 and $21 million in 2011. UniSource Energy also has not included amounts payable to PWMT under UNS Electrics full requirements power supply agreement as payments under this contract are usage based with no fixed demand charges and are recovered through the purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) mechanism. We expect to spend approximately $100 million annually under this contract through May 2008. (8) Amounts include UNS Gas fixed price forward gas purchases and firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern. Incremental gas purchases are excluded as prices and volumes vary. Amounts also exclude swap agreements which are marked to market on a monthly basis and do not include any minimum payment obligation. UNS Gas entered into forward gas purchases for 2007 through 2010 totaling $9 million subsequent to December 31, 2006, which are excluded from the table above. (9) Excludes TEPs liability for final environmental reclamation at the coal mines which supply the remote generating stations. TEP estimates its undiscounted final reclamation liability is $41 million with reclamation beginning in 2028. See Note 6. Also excludes asset retirement obligations expected to occur through 2066. See Note 3. Also, excludes Millenniums equity commitments totaling $1 million over two years to fund subsidiaries (Valley Ventures) as suitable investments are identified. (10) These obligations represent TEP and UES minimum required contributions to pension plans in 2007 and TEPs expected postretirement benefit costs to cover medical and life insurance claims as determined by the plans actuaries. TEP and UES do not know and have not included pension contributions beyond 2007 due to the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts. TEP funds the postretirement benefit plan on a pay as you go basis. (11) These obligations represent TEPs share of the cost of new pollution control equipment based on its ownership of San Juan. Under a settlement agreement signed in March 2005 with the New Mexico Environmental Department and environmental activist groups, the co owners of San Juan will install new technology at the generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx, and SO2 emissions. In addition, TEPs share of increased operating and maintenance costs associated with the new technologies is expected to be approximately $12 million over the next 10 years. (12) TEP has agreed with the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP is obligated to acquire the facilities at fixed prices of $120 million in 2015, $38 million in 2017, and $68 million in 2021. Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 17% and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: We do not have any provisions in any of our debt or lease agreements that would cause an event of default or cause amounts to become due and payable in the event of a credit rating downgrade. None of our contracts or financing structures contains provisions or acceleration clauses due to changes in our stock price. Dividends on Common Stock On February 9, 2007, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.225 per share on its Common Stock. The first quarter dividend, totaling approximately $8 million, will be paid March 14, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. During 2006, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.21 per share, totaling approximately $29 million. In 2005, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.19 per share, totaling approximately $26 million. Income Tax Position At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal and state income tax filing purposes, the following carryforward amounts: UniSource Energy TEP Amount Expiring Amount Expiring Millions of Dollars Year Millions of Dollars Year Capital Loss $ 37 2010 2011 $ AMT Credit 48 34 K 36 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Service Matters On its 2002 tax return, TEP filed for an automatic change in accounting method relating to the capitalization of indirect costs to the production of electricity and self constructed assets. The new accounting method was also used on the 2003 and 2004 returns for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. In August 2005, the IRS issued a ruling which draws into question the ability of electric and gas utilities to use the new accounting method. As a result, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have filed amended returns for 2002, 2003 and 2004 to remove the benefit previously claimed using the accounting method. In 2006, TEP and UNS Electric remitted tax and interest of $23 million and $1 million respectively to the IRS; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric remitted $8 million to state authorities. In December 2006, the IRS issued a final notice to the company disallowing the use of the accounting method. We are in the process of filing a protest and will proceed to appeals. TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial condition and results of operations of TEP are currently the principal factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of UniSource Energy on an annual basis. The following discussion relates to TEPs utility operations, unless otherwise noted. 2006 Compared With 2005 TEP recorded net income of $67 million in 2006 compared with $48 million in 2005. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2006 included: a $53 million increase in total operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather during the second quarter and retail customer growth; a $9 million increase in wholesale revenues due primarily to $3 million of transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in unrealized gains related to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Margins on wholesale sales were lower than last year due to a decline in the average market price for power; a $23 million increase in other revenues due primarily to fees and reimbursements received from Tri State for fuel and O&M costs related to Springerville Unit 3; a $24 million decrease in purchased power expense due to increased production at TEPs coal fired generating plants and the availability of Luna to offset some of the wholesale purchases to meet retail customer demand during peak summer periods. Purchased power expense also reflects a $4 million increase in unrealized losses due to mark to market adjustments on forward purchases of energy; offset by a $31 million increase in fuel expense due to increased generation at TEPs coal fired plants, gas related fuel expense at Luna and $8 million of fuel costs associated with Springerville Unit 3; a $31 million increase in O&M expense. TEPs O&M includes $9 million of expenses related to Springerville Unit 3. In addition, pre tax gains related to the sale of excess SO2 emission allowances were $7 million lower than 2005. Other factors contributing to higher O&M include operating expenses at Luna; generating plant maintenance; and higher payroll expenses; a $10 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and K 37 Table of Contents a $13 million decrease in total interest expense due primarily to lower interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations, which was partially offset by interest paid to the IRS related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and fees incurred in the third quarter of 2006 related to amending TEPs Credit Agreement. In 2006, the net pre tax benefit recognized by TEP related to Springerville Unit 3 for transmission revenues, operating fees and its share of the common costs was $8 million. 2005 Compared With 2004 TEP recorded income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $49 million in 2005 compared with $46 million in 2004. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2005 Included: a $26 million decrease in TEPs total operating revenue less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $60 million increase in TEPs purchased power expense resulting primarily from an extended unplanned outage of Springerville Unit 2 in August 2005, planned maintenance outages at San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 during the second quarter and higher wholesale power prices; a $14 million increase in TEPs fuel expense due to a $3 million increase in natural gas costs primarily from higher gas prices and an $11 million increase in coal costs; a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather and a 3% increase in TEPs customer base; and a $19 million increase in TEPs wholesale revenues due to higher market prices for power compared to last year. a $22 million decrease in O&M. Higher maintenance costs at TEPs coal fired plants were offset by an increase of $10 million in pre tax gains on the sale of excess SO2 Emission Allowances by TEP; a $6 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and a $17 million decrease in total interest expense related to the financial restructuring of TEP in May 2005. 2004 Included: expenses of $8 million related to a proposed but terminated acquisition of UniSource Energy. Utility Sales and Revenues Customer growth, weather and other consumption factors affect retail sales of electricity. Electric wholesale revenues are affected by market prices in the wholesale energy market, the availability of TEP generating resources, and the level of wholesale forward contract activity. K 38 Table of Contents The table below provides trend information on retail sales by major customer class and electric wholesale sales made by TEP in the last three years as well as weather data for TEPs service territory.

Wholesale revenues increased $9 million in 2006 compared with last year. In 2006, wholesale revenues included $3 million in transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in net unrealized gain due to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Wholesale kWh sales increased 8% primarily due to the higher availability of TEPs coal plants; however, margins on wholesale sales were lower due to a 16% decrease in the average market price of wholesale energy. TEPs margins on wholesale sales were higher in 2005, as hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico boosted market prices for wholesale energy in the last six months of the year. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Mark to Market Adjustments on Trading Activity The table below summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) on TEPs forward sales and purchases of energy. Net unrealized gains (losses) on forward sales of energy are presented on the income statement in wholesale revenues. Net unrealized gains (losses) on forward purchases of energy are presented on the income statement in purchased power expense.

Residential kWh sales increased 5% and commercial kWh sales increased 4% during 2005. Despite lower coal plant availability and a 3% decrease in wholesale kWh sales, wholesale revenues increased $18 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared with 2004. The average wholesale market price of energy was $59 per MWh in 2005, compared with $44 per MWh in 2004. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Operating Expenses 2006 Compared with 2005 Fuel and Purchased Power TEPs fuel and purchased power expense, and energy resources for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are detailed below: Generation Expense 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of kWh Millions of Dollars Coal Fired Generation Four Corners 812 783 749 $ 12 $ 11 $ 10 Navajo 1,215 1,221 1,244 17 16 15 San Juan 2,486 2,484 2,435 56 53 48 Springerville 5,826 5,572 5,731 96 94 92 Sundt 4 623 787 735 14 16 14 Total Coal Fired Generation 10,962 10,847 10,894 $ 195 $ 190 $ 179 Gas Fired Generation Luna 516 24 Other Units 334 368 432 31 36 34 Total Gas Fired Generation 850 368 432 55 36 34 Solar and Other Generation 9 9 8 Total Generation (1) 11,821 11,224 11,334 250 226 213 Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 103 131 73 Net Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Forward Purchases of Energy 6 2 Total Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 109 133 73 Total Resources 13,528 12,863 12,656 $ 359 $ 359 $ 286 Less Line Losses and Company Use 886 806 821 Total Energy Sold 12,642 12,057 11,835 (1) Fuel expense in 2006 excludes $8 million related to Springerville Unit 3; the fuel costs incurred on behalf of Unit 3 are recorded in Fuel Expense and the reimbursement by Tri State is recorded in Other Revenue. The start of commercial operation of Luna and higher coal plant availability in the summer months led to a $24 million increase in fuel expense in 2006 (excluding fuel expenses at Springerville Unit 3); however, purchased power expense decreased $24 million as these same factors reduced TEPs need to purchase power during the summer months to meet retail demand. Gas fired generation more than doubled in 2006, causing gas related fuel expense to increase $19 million, or 53%. Coal fired generation increased 1%, leading to a $5 million increase in coal related fuel expense. Lunas generation output reported in the table above includes energy generated during its test phase, but does not include any associated fuel costs which were capitalized and reported as project costs. Despite a 4% increase in purchased energy volumes, purchased power expense was $24 million, or 18%, lower due to a decrease in average wholesale energy prices in 2006 as well as fewer short term purchases during the summer months when market prices for wholesale energy are typically higher. In September 2006, TEP began purchasing energy from Tri State under a 100 MW purchased power agreement. The table below shows TEPs average resource cost per kWh generated: K 40 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 cents per kWh Coal 1.78 1.75 1.64 Gas 6.69 9.78 7.87 All sources 2.61 2.01 1.88 *In 2006, the average cost of gas generation per kWh excludes test energy produced at Luna and its associated fuel costs. TRA amortization increased $10 million in 2006. Amortization of the TRA is the result of the Settlement Agreement with the ACC, which changed the accounting method for TEPs generation operations. This item reflects the recovery, through 2008, of transition recovery assets which were previously regulatory assets of the generation business. The amount of amortization is a function of the TRA balance and total kWh consumption by TEPs distribution customers. The table below shows estimated annual TRA amortization and unamortized TRA year end balances for 2007 and 2008. Estimated Unamortized TRA Amortization TRA Balance Millions of Dollars 2007 76 26 2008 26 Other Income (Deductions) In 2005, TEPs Income Statement included inter company Interest Income of $2 million. This represented Interest Income on a promissory note TEP received from UniSource Energy in exchange for the transfer to UniSource Energy of its stock in Millennium in 1998. UniSource Energy repaid the inter company promissory note on March 1, 2005. On UniSource Energys Consolidated Statement of Income, this Interest Income, as well as UniSource Energys related interest expense, was eliminated as an inter company transaction. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, TEP Cash Flows, Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy, below. Operating Expenses 2005 Compared with 2004 Fuel and Purchased Power During 2005, planned outages at Springerville Unit 2, San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 and an extended unplanned outage at Springerville Unit 2 during the third quarter led to higher gas related fuel costs and an 82% increase in purchased power expense. Purchased power expense increased $60 million compared with 2004, due to a 19% increase in MWhs purchased and an increase in wholesale market prices for power. The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Palo Verde Index increased 34% in 2005 compared with average prices in 2004. A combination of higher coal and natural gas costs contributed to a $13 million increase in total fuel expense at TEPs generating plants in 2005. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change TEP adopted FIN 47 in December 2005 and recorded a one time $1 million after tax cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and Critical Accounting Estimates, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, below. K 41 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Competition In 2001, all of TEPs retail customers became eligible to choose an alternative energy service provider (ESP), however, only a small number of commercial and industrial customers initially chose an ESP. By 2002, none of TEPs retail customers were served by an alternative ESP. In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. In February 2006, the ACC Staff requested that a proceeding be opened to address the issue of retail electric competition. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules. TEP has met all conditions required by the ACC to facilitate electric retail competition, including ACC approval of TEPs direct access tariffs. See Rates, ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement, below. TEP competes against gas service suppliers and others that provide energy services. Other forms of energy technologies may provide competition to TEPs services in the future, but to date, are generally not financially viable alternatives for its retail customers. Self generation by TEPs large industrial customers could also provide competition for TEPs services in the future, but has not had a significant impact to date. In the wholesale market, TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy. ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement Beginning in May 2005, TEP filed a series of pleadings requesting the ACC to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the methodology that will be applied to determine TEPs rates for generation service after 2008. TEP filed the pleadings in response to the Arizona Court of Appeals ruling related to retail competition and market pricing and a lack of agreement as to the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement by a number of participants in TEPs rate proceedings. TEP believes that the Settlement Agreement contemplated market based rates for generation service after 2008. See Competition, above for information regarding the recent court ruling. In April 2006, the ACC ordered that a procedure be established to allow for an expeditious and complete review of, among other things, the Settlement Agreement and its effect on how TEPs rates for generation services will be determined after December 31, 2008. The testimony filed by a number of participants in this proceeding, including the ACC Staff and Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO), reflect differing interpretations of the Settlement Agreement and a belief that TEP is required to charge cost of service rates for generation service in 2009. According to testimony filed by TEP, its average retail rate would increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. TEP also proposed two alternatives to charging market based rates for generation in 2009: a market phase in proposal with an initial rate increase capped at 12%; and a cost of service (including an $850 million regulatory asset and energy cost adjustment clause) proposal that would increase average retail rates in 2009 approximately 26% over current rates. See TEP Testimony, The Market Phase in Proposal, and The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal, below for more information. In February 2007, parties in this proceeding participated in settlement discussions, however were unable to reach a settlement. A public hearing before an ACC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) is scheduled to begin on March 6, 2007. Following the public hearing, the ALJ will propose a recommended opinion and order for consideration by the ACC. We expect the ALJ to issue a recommendation in the second quarter of 2007. If the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement allowing TEP to charge market based rates for generation service in 2009 and orders TEP to return to cost of service generation rates without compensating TEP for financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, TEP will file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages. K 42 Table of Contents Rates Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Rules that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. The Rules and the Settlement Agreement established: a period from November 1999 through 2008 for TEP to transition its generation assets from a cost of service based rate structure to a market, or competitive, rate structure; the recovery through rates during the transition period of $450 million of stranded generation costs through a fixed competitive transition charge (Fixed CTC); capped rates for TEP retail customers through 2008; an ACC interim review of TEP retail rates in 2004; unbundling of electric services with separate rates or prices for generation, transmission, distribution, metering, meter reading, billing and collection, and ancillary services; a process for ESPs to become licensed by the ACC to sell generation services at market prices to TEP retail customers; access for TEP retail customers to buy market priced generation services from ESPs beginning in 2000 (currently, no TEP customers are purchasing generation services from ESPs); transmission and distribution services would remain subject to regulation on a cost of service basis; and beginning in 2009, TEPs generation would be market based and its retail customers would pay the market rate for generation services. Track A and Track B Proceedings During 2002 and 2003, the ACC reexamined circumstances that had changed since it approved the Rules in 1999. The outstanding issues were divided into two groups. Track A related primarily to the divestiture of generation assets while Track B related primarily to the competitive energy bidding process. Under the ACCs Rules, TEP and other utilities were required to divest their generation assets. TEP later requested a waiver of the divestiture requirement. The Track A order granted TEPs request and eliminated the divesture requirement. As a result, generation assets remain at TEP. At the same time, the ACC ordered the parties, including TEP, to develop a competitive bidding process and reduced the minimum amount of power to be acquired in the competitive bidding process to only that portion not supplied by TEPs existing resources. The ACC Track B order defined the competitive bidding process TEP must use to obtain capacity and energy requirements. The Track B order did not address TEPs purchased power or asset acquisitions occurring subsequent to the 2003 competitive solicitation. 2004 General Rate Case Information In June 2004, as required by the Settlement Agreement, TEP filed general rate case information with the ACC. TEPs filing did not propose any change in retail rates and, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no rate case filed by TEP through 2008 may result in a net rate increase. However, absent the restriction on raising rates, TEP believes that the data in its filing would have justified an increase in retail rates of 16%. The general rate case information used a historical test year ended December 31, 2003 and established, based on TEPs standard offer service, that TEP was experiencing a revenue deficiency of $111 million. None of the intervenor testimony filed proposed any decrease to TEPs rates. Testimony filed by the ACC Staff, Residential Utility Consumer Office and Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition indicated revenue deficiencies for TEP of $67 million, $32 million and $38 million, respectively. In 2005, the ALJ issued a procedural order suspending the remaining testimony filing deadlines and hearing in the 2004 rate review. K 43 Table of Contents TEP Testimony In August 2006, TEP filed testimony in the ACC proceedings to review the Settlement Agreement. TEPs testimony states its belief that it is entitled to charge market based generation service rates in 2009 and has complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. TEP testimony states that the Settlement Agreement provided the terms and conditions by which TEP is to transition into the competitive electric marketplace. The rate impact of charging market based generation service rates in 2009 would vary with market conditions which are influenced by the cost of natural gas. Assuming a natural gas cost of $7 per MMBtu, which equates to a wholesale power price of approximately $60 per MWh, TEPs average retail rate would be expected to increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. The Settlement Agreement required TEP to significantly change the way it conducted business. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, TEP agreed to: (i) rate reductions in 1999 and 2000; (ii) a rate freeze from July 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008, taking all the risk of inflation and cost increases; (iii) unbundled tariffed rates; (iv) accelerate depreciation of certain generation related assets; (v) offset the standard offer generation rate (Market Generation Credit) by the amount of the Floating Competition Transition Charge; (vi) open its exclusive service territory to competition for generation service; (vii) assume the volatility and risk of market rates in 2009; and (viii) a rate check in 2004 when rates could not increase but could actually decrease. In the testimony, TEP states that if the ACC or other parties to the Settlement Agreement seek to unilaterally change the contract and order TEP back to cost of service, which is a breach that will force TEP to protect its rights in court and seek an order, which may include an award for damages. TEP states that, if the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement, does not agree to one of TEPs alternative proposals, and orders that TEPs generation service rates will be based on traditional cost of service ratemaking without compensating TEP for the financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, then TEP must: (1) file a rate case and (2) immediately file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages arising from the ACCs breach of the Settlement Agreement. TEP states that the financial impacts and costs directly attributable to the Settlement Agreement exceed $850 million. In the testimony, TEP offered alternatives to charging market based generation service rates after December 31, 2008, as described below. The Market Phase In Proposal TEP proposed a market rate phase in plan in the event that the ACC desires to maintain a competitive wholesale generation market, but wants to mitigate the immediate impact of market rates. Elements of the market rate phase in include: A cap would be set such that no customer class would realize an initial rate increase in excess of 12%. The phase in period would begin in 2009, last approximately four years and then be fully market based; TEPs current rates would remain frozen through the end of 2008; and Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs. The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal TEPs cost of service proposal presents a framework for returning TEP to cost of service regulation for generation service if the ACC determines that it will abandon the concept of a competitive wholesale and retail generation market. Elements of the proposal include: A new regulatory asset of $850 million to be included in rate base will be created to compensate TEP for the financial impacts and costs incurred in performing under the Settlement Agreement; An energy cost adjustment clause (ECAC) to recover energy costs associated with serving the incremental retail load above that filed in its cost of service test year; Immediate filing of a cost of service rate case in 2007; K 44 Table of Contents Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs; and Restore exclusivity of TEPs certificate of convenience and necessity. The proposed ECAC would differ from some other purchase power and fuel clauses in that it would not include any fuel or purchased power price risks or plant operating risks associated with serving the test year portion of TEPs retail load. Also, the ECAC would not be a straight pass through of purchased power costs to serve the incremental load. In the event that TEPs actual fuel and purchased power costs related to the incremental load exceeds the ECAC rate, TEP would not be able to pass the excess costs through to customers. However, in the event that those costs are less than the ECAC rate, TEP would be entitled to retain those earnings. If the ACC adopts TEPs cost of service proposal and approves a new regulatory asset of $850 million and implementation of the ECAC mechanism, TEP expects that its average retail rate in 2009 would increase by approximately 26% over current rates. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate or purchase at least 15% of their total annual retail energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025, with smaller amounts required in earlier years starting when the REST tariff submitted by an affected utility is approved by the ACC. To provide an opportunity for full recovery of the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the adopted REST rules allow for a new tariff to be implemented separate and apart from the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. The rules require affected utilities to annually file with the ACC a REST tariff request with a REST implementation plan to recover the cost of purchasing or installing and operating the renewable resources. The tariff amount is annually subject to ACC approval. The REST rules require utilities to file annual compliance reports outlining the results of the renewable programs implemented the prior year, highlighting steps they are taking to meet the REST annual renewable energy requirements. The REST rules adopted by the ACC must be certified by the Arizona Attorney General before taking effect. As of February 23, 2007, the Attorney General had not issued an opinion certifying the REST rules. Western Energy Markets As a participant in the Western U.S. wholesale power markets, TEP is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions and market participants. TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy at market based rates in the wholesale market. At the end of 2006, electric generating capacity in Arizona was approximately 25,600 MW, an increase of 61% since 2001. A majority of the growth is the result of 17 new or upgraded gas fired generating units with a combined capacity of approximately 9,700 MW. The completion of Springerville Unit 3 in 2006 provided 400 MW of new coal fired generation located in Arizona. Market Prices The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index decreased in 2006, as did the average price for natural gas based on the Permian Index. We cannot predict whether changes in various factors that influence demand and supply will cause prices to change during 2007. K 45 Table of Contents Average Market Price for Around the Clock Energy $/MWh Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 48 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 78 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 50 Year ended December 31, 2005 59 Average Market Price for Natural Gas $/MMBtu Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 5.58 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 9.67 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 6.05 Year ended December 31, 2005 7.17 In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel and gas indexed purchased power with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP currently has approximately 35% of this exposure hedged for the summer peak period of 2007 (June September) at a weighted average price of $7.18 per MMBtu. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. Market prices may also affect TEPs wholesale revenues. TEP commits to future sales of energy as part of its ongoing efforts to hedge its excess generation based on projected generation capability, forward prices and generation costs. For the first quarter of 2007, TEP has sold forward approximately 255,000 MWh at an average price of $70 per MWh, which excludes on peak hours in April through September. We expect the market price and demand for capacity and energy to continue to be influenced by factors including: availability and price of natural gas; weather; continued population growth in the Western U.S.; economic conditions in the Western U.S.; availability of generating capacity throughout the Western U.S.; the extent of electric utility industry restructuring in Arizona, California and other Western states; FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets; availability of hydropower; transmission constraints; and environmental regulations and the cost of compliance. Coal Supply On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The cost of coal and transportation under the agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. Based on these agreements, and increases at other coal fired plants, we expect TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants to increase by approximately $17 million, or 9% in 2007. Emission Allowances TEP has SO2 Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to operate its generating units. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. From time to time, TEP will sell a portion of its excess SO2 Emission Allowances. The table below summarizes sales made in 2005 and 2006, and forward sales of SO2 Emission Allowances, as of December 31, 2006. K 46 Table of Contents Delivery Allowances Sold Pre tax Gain (millions) 2005 15,000 $13 2006 10,000 7 2007 10,000 8 In addition to the allowances contracted to be sold in 2007, TEP expects to have approximately 20,000 excess SO2 Emission Allowances through 2009. Springerville Units 3 and 4 Springerville Unit 3, which commenced commercial operation in July 2006, is a 400 MW coal fired generating facility located at the same site as Springerville Units 1 and 2. Tri State is leasing 100% of Unit 3 from a financial owner. TEP allocates a portion of the fixed costs of the existing common facilities to the additional generating unit. TEP operates Unit 3 and will receive annual pre tax benefits of approximately $15 million in the form of transmission revenues, rental payments and other fees and cost savings. As part of the project, Tri State provided funding to improve sulfur dioxide scrubbers, low nitrogen oxide burners and other emission control upgrades for Units 1 and 2, which were completed in 2005. SRP is purchasing 100 MW of capacity from Tri State under a 30 year power purchase agreement. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired generating facility at the same Springerville site. Construction of Unit 4 has begun and, under the terms of existing regulatory permits, is required to be completed by December 31, 2009. Prior to Unit 4s completion, TEP may be required, along with Tri State, to exercise best efforts to find a replacement purchaser for SRP to purchase 100 MW of capacity from Unit 3. If TEP and Tri State are unable to find such a replacement purchaser, TEP would then purchase 100 MW of output from Unit 4, beginning with the commercial operation of Unit 4. Given the current level of wholesale power market prices, we believe it is unlikely that TEP would be required to find a replacement purchaser or to purchase SRPs 100 MW. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TEP Cash Flows During 2007, TEP expects to generate sufficient internal cash flows to fund most of its construction expenditures as well as its operating activities, required debt maturities and dividends to UniSource Energy. Cash flows may vary during the year, with cash flow from operations typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. As a result of the varied seasonal cash flow, TEP will use, as needed, its revolving credit facility to fund its business activities. The table below shows the cash available to TEP after capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and payments on capital lease obligations: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Capital Expenditures (156 ) (150 ) (129 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Scheduled Repayments of Long Term Debt (2 ) Less: Retirement of Capital Lease Obligations (61 ) (53 ) (49 ) Plus: Proceeds from Investment in Lease Debt 22 14 12 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* $ 32 $ 54 $ 107 K 47 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Net Cash Flows Investing Activities (GAAP) (182 ) (129 ) (126 ) Net Cash Flows Financing Activities (GAAP) (79 ) (174 ) (101 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* 32 54 107 * Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments, both non GAAP measures of liquidity, should not be considered as alternatives to Net Cash Flows Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity. We believe that Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments provide useful information to investors as measures of liquidity and our ability to fund our capital requirements, make required payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and pay dividends to UniSource Energy. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures, TEP may use its revolving credit facility on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements from TEPs strong customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of TEPs rate related proceedings. Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities decreased by $16 million compared with the same period in 2005. Net cash flows were impacted by: 2006 included: a $28 million increase in cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs, due primarily to retail customer growth, higher availability of excess power to sell into the wholesale market; and the availability of Luna to offset some of TEPs purchased power requirements; and a $16 million decrease in total interest paid due to lower capital lease obligation balances, lower long term debt balances and lower annual fees under the TEP credit agreement that was entered into in May 2005 and amended in August 2006; a $20 million increase in other cash receipts due primarily to payments from Tri State for fees and the reimbursement of operating costs related to Springerville Unit 3; offset by a $42 million increase in income taxes paid due to a $31 million payment made to the IRS and state authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments; an $11 million increase in O&M costs due primarily to operating costs at Luna and higher generating plant maintenance costs; an $8 million decline in proceeds from the sale of excess emission allowances; a $4 million increase in taxes other than income taxes; and a $3 million increase in wages paid. 2005 included: $11 million of interest received from UniSource Energy related to an inter company note repaid in the first quarter of 2005. K 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $53 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to: a $9 million increase in proceeds from investments in Springerville Lease Debt; offset by a $6 million increase in capital expenditures related to TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna and growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; and TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease, which represents approximately 53 MW of capacity. Capital Expenditures TEPs forecasted capital expenditures are summarized below: Category 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars Transmission, Distribution and Other Facilities $ 144 $ 149 $ 120 $ 183 $ 184 Generation Facilities 36 47 67 33 98 Environmental 18 42 8 8 10 Total $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 292 Capital expenditures for TEP of $855 million for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $216 million, or 34% higher than our 2005 forecast. This increase is the result of several factors including: strong customer growth; higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; the reinforcement and expansion of distribution lines; and environmental upgrades to generating facilities. These estimated expenditures include costs for TEP to comply with current federal and state environmental regulations. These estimates do not include the costs to construct the proposed Tucson to Nogales, Arizona transmission line. All of these estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual construction expenditures may be different from these estimates due to changes in business conditions, construction schedules, environmental requirements, and changes to TEPs business arising from retail competition. TEP plans to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash flow. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line If all regulatory approvals are received, the future costs to construct the transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona is expected to be approximately $95 million. Through December 31, 2006, approximately $11 million in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses have been incurred on this project. If the required approvals are not received, TEP may be required to expense a portion of the costs that have been capitalized related to the project, propose alternative methods to the ACC for improving reliability and spend additional amounts to implement such alternatives. See Item 1. Business, Tucson Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. In addition to TEPs forecasted capital expenditures for construction, TEPs other capital requirements include its required debt maturities and capital lease obligations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities, and Capital Lease Obligations. Investments in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity At December 31, 2006, TEP had $181 million of investments in lease debt and equity on its balance sheet. The yields on TEPs investments in Springerville Lease Debt, at the date of purchase, range from 8.9% to 12.7%. The table below provides a summary of the investment balances in lease debt. K 49 Table of Contents Lease Debt Investment Balance Leased Asset December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 In Millions Investments in Lease Debt: Springerville Unit 1 $ 81 $ 91 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 52 65 Total Investment in Lease Debt $ 133 $ 156 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $95 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. The following factors contributed to the decrease: 2006 included: a $30 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility; offset by a $16 million increase in dividends paid to UniSource Energy; and an $8 million increase in scheduled payments made on capital lease obligations. 2005 included: a $110 million equity investment by UniSource Energy; and $95 million from UniSource Energy as a repayment for an inter company loan; offset by $282 million to repay long term debt; $5 million for debt issuance and retirement costs. At December 31, 2006, there were $30 million in outstanding borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility. TEP Credit Agreement In August 2006, TEP amended and restated its existing credit agreement (TEP Credit Agreement). The amendment reduced the interest rate and fees payable on TEPs borrowings and letters of credit, increased the amount of its revolving credit facility to $150 million from $60 million, and extended the maturity to August 2011 from May 2010. In addition to the revolving credit facility, the TEP Credit Agreement includes a $341 million letter of credit facility which supports $329 million of tax exempt variable rate bonds. The TEP Credit Agreement is secured by $491 million of 1992 Mortgage Bonds. Interest rates and fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 0.55% per annum and amounts drawn under a letter of credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum. TEP has the option of paying interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 0.55% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The TEP Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and sale leaseback agreements. The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP to meet a minimum cash coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement, it may pay dividends to UniSource Energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the TEP Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the TEP Credit Agreement; change in control, as defined; failure of TEP or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million; or certain bankruptcy events at TEP or certain subsidiaries. K 50 Table of Contents Springerville Common Facilities Leases In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one half ownership interest in the common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station. TEP refinanced the lease debt totaling $68 million in June 2006. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The refinancing had no impact on the Springerville Common Facilities capital lease obligation or asset. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. The LIBOR rate in effect on December 31, 2006 was 5.63%, and 3.68% on December 31, 2005, which resulted in a total interest rate on the lease debt of 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy In March 2005, UniSource Energy repaid to TEP a debt obligation in the principal amount of $95 million plus accrued interest of $11 million. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Capital Contribution from UniSource Energy In May 2005, UniSource Energy made a $110 million capital contribution to TEP. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Bond Repurchases and Redemptions TEP made a sinking fund payment of $1 million on its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs in January 2005. In March 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $31 million of its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2008, as well as the remaining $21 million of its 7.5% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2006. In May 2005, TEP used the proceeds from the repayment of the note from UniSource Energy and the capital contribution from UniSource Energy to purchase $147 million of its 1997 Pima Series B and $74 million of its 1997 Pima Series C fixed rate tax exempt bonds (Repurchased Bonds) at a price of $101.50 per $100 principal amount. In May 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $4 million of bonds outstanding under those series. TEP does not currently plan on canceling the Repurchased Bonds, which will remain outstanding under their respective indentures; however, the Repurchased Bonds will not be presented in our financial statements. TEP may choose to resell the Repurchased Bonds to third parties or cancel them in the future. Mortgage Indentures In June 2005, TEP terminated its 1941 Mortgage (formerly known as its First Mortgage). TEPs remaining mortgage is its 1992 Mortgage (formerly known as its Second Mortgage). TEPs mortgage indenture creates a lien on and security interest in most of TEPs utility plant assets. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos, is not subject to this lien and security interest. TEPs mortgage indenture allows TEP to issue additional mortgage bonds on the basis of (1) a percentage of net utility property additions and or (2) the principal amount of retired mortgage bonds. The amount of bonds that TEP may issue is also subject to a net earnings test under the indenture. TEPs Credit Agreement, which totals $491 million and is secured by 1992 Mortgage Bonds, limits the amount of mortgage bonds that may be outstanding to no more than $840 million. At December 31, 2006, TEP had a total of $629 million in outstanding mortgage bonds, consisting of $491 million in bonds securing the TEP Credit Agreement, and $138 million in bonds securing the 7.50% Collateral Trust Bonds due in 2008. Although the 1992 Mortgage would allow TEP to issue additional bonds, the limit imposed by the TEP Credit Agreement is more restrictive and is currently the governing limitation. K 51 Table of Contents Tax Exempt Local Furnishing Bonds TEP has financed a substantial portion of utility plant assets with industrial development revenue bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authorities of Pima County and Apache County. The interest on these bonds is excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal tax purposes. This exclusion is allowed because the facilities qualify as facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. These bonds are sometimes referred to as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. To qualify for this exclusion, the facilities must be part of a system providing electric service to customers within not more than two contiguous counties. TEP provides electric service to retail customers in the City of Tucson and certain other portions of Pima County, Arizona and to Fort Huachuca in contiguous Cochise County, Arizona. TEP has financed the following facilities, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of tax exempt local furnishing bonds: Springerville Unit 2, Sundt Unit 4, a dedicated 345 kV transmission line from Springerville Unit 2 to TEPs retail service area (the Express Line), and a portion of TEPs local transmission and distribution system in the Tucson metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had approximately $359 million of tax exempt local furnishing bonds outstanding. Approximately $257 million in principal amount of such bonds financed Springerville Unit 2 and the Express Line. In addition, approximately $38 million of remaining lease debt related to the Sundt Unit 4 lease obligation was issued as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. Various events might cause TEP to have to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds: formation of an RTO or ISO; asset divestiture; changes in tax laws; or changes in system operations. TEP believes that its qualification as a local furnishing system should not be lost so long as (1) the RTO or ISO would not change the operation of the Express Line or the transmission facilities within TEPs local service area, (2) the RTO or ISO allows pricing of transmission service such that the benefits of tax exempt financing continue to accrue to retail customers, and (3) energy produced by Springerville Unit 2 and TEPs local generating units continues to be consumed in TEPs local service area. However, there is no assurance that such qualification can be maintained. Any redemption or defeasance of these bonds would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater amount. Capital Lease Obligations At December 31, 2006, TEP had $647 million of total capital lease obligations on its balance sheet. The table below provides a summary of the outstanding lease amounts in each of the obligations. Leased Asset Capital Lease Obligation Balance at December 31, 2006 Expiration In Millions Springerville Unit 1 $381 2015 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 112 2015 Springerville Common Facilities 107 2020 Sundt Unit 4 46 2011 Other Leases 1 2008 Total Capital Lease Obligations $647 Except for TEPs 14% equity ownership in the Springerville Unit 1 Leases and its 13% equity ownership in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, TEP will not own these assets at the expiration of the leases. TEP may renew the leases or purchase the leased assets at such time. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, while the purchase price option is fixed for the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Facilities. See UniSource Energy, Contractual Obligations, footnote (3), for more information about the fixed purchase price amounts.

We have no other commercial commitments to report. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: TEPs Credit Agreement contains pricing for its Revolving Credit Facility based on TEPs credit ratings. A change in TEPs credit ratings can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of interest TEP pays on its borrowings. TEPs Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including interest coverage and leverage tests. Failure to comply with these covenants would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with these covenants. See TEP Credit Agreement, above. TEP conducts its wholesale marketing and risk management activities under certain master agreements whereby TEP may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values, a change in TEPs credit ratings or if there has been a material change in TEPs creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, TEP has not been required to post such credit enhancement. Dividends on Common Stock TEP declared and paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $62 million in 2006, $46 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. TEP can pay dividends if it maintains compliance with the TEP Credit Agreement and certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. K 53 Table of Contents The Federal Power Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital accounts. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe that there is a reasonable basis to pay dividends from current year earnings. UNS GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UniSource Energy formed two operating companies, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, to acquire the Arizona electric and gas assets from Citizens in 2003, as well as an intermediate holding company, UES, to hold the common stock of UNS Gas and UNS Electric. UNS Gas reported net income of $4 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $6 million in 2004. We expect operations at UNS Gas to vary with the seasons, with peak energy usage occurring in the winter months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had approximately 145,000 retail customers, a 5% increase from last year. The table below shows UNS Gas therm sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Approximately one half of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas while the remainder benefits retail customers through a credit to the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below.

In 2006, retail revenues increased $24 million and purchased energy expense increased $23 million, due primarily to the PGA surcharge increase, which became effective in November 2005. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation Energy, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Gas retail rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism. The PGA mechanism has two components, the PGA factor and the PGA surcharge or credit. The PGA factor is a mechanism that compares the twelve month rolling weighted average gas cost to the base cost of gas, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve month period. The actual gas and transportation costs that are either under or over collected through the base rate of $0.40 per therm or $4.00 per MMBtu and the PGA factor are charged or credited to a balancing account (PGA bank). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the average PGA factor was approximately $0.33 per therm or $3.33 per MMBtu. The current annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor is $0.10 per therm in a twelve month period. As part of its general rate case proceeding with the ACC, UNS Gas requested to remove the cap to allow for more timely recovery of actual gas costs. See General Rate Case Filing, below. When the ACC designated under or over recovery trigger points of $6.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge or credit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred from or to customers over a period deemed appropriate by the ACC. On December 31, 2006, the PGA bank balance was over collected by $2 million on the basis as billed to customers. In December 2006, the ACC approved a proposal by UNS Gas that lowered the PGA surcharge to $0.05 per therm. The $0.05 per therm PGA surcharge will remain in effect through April 2007. Based on current projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the lower surcharge amount will allow it to timely recover its gas costs and still provide rate relief to its customers. Changes in the market price for gas, sales volumes and surcharge amount could significantly change the PGA bank balance in the future. General Rate Case Filing UNS Gas current rates have been in place since August 2003 and were designed to provide a 9.05% return on original cost rate base of $118 million. As a result of increased growth in UNS Gas service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Gas to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Gas request: Test year Year ended December 31, 2005 Original cost rate base $162 million Revenue deficiency $10 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 7% Cost of debt 6.60% Cost of equity 11.00% Hypothetical capital structure 50% equity / 50% debt Weighted average cost of capital 8.80% K 55 Table of Contents UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices, inappropriate price signals to customers and the potential for over or under collections to result in the accumulation of large bank balances. In February 2007, ACC staff filed testimony that indicated a revenue deficiency for UNS Gas of approximately $5 million; RUCOs testimony indicated a revenue deficiency of approximately $2 million. The procedural schedule for the UNS Gas rate case is as follows: Filing Date UNS Gas rebuttal testimony March 9, 2007 ACC Staff & intervenor rebuttal testimony March 30, 2007 UNS Gas rejoinder testimony April 6, 2007 Hearing before ALJ April 16, 2007 UNS Gas expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the second half of 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Gas capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $23 million. UNS Gas expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a large portion of its construction expenditures. If natural gas prices rise and UNS Gas is not allowed to recover its projected gas costs or PGA bank balance on a timely basis, UNS Gas may require additional funding to meet operating and capital requirements. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contribution from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Gas general rate case that was filed in July 2006. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 32 $ 14 $ 21 Capital Expenditures 23 23 19 Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Gas are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Gas $38 $33 $27 $28 $26 UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver In August 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric amended and restated their existing unsecured revolving credit agreement (UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver). The amendment reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings and, upon ACC approval, will increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to $60 million from $40 million, and extend the maturity from April 2008 to August 2011. Currently, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $30 million, but the total combined amount borrowed cannot exceed $40 million. Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. UNS Gas is only liable for UNS Gas borrowings, and similarly, UNS Electric is only liable for UNS Electrics borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. UES guarantees the obligations of both UNS Gas and UNS Electric. K 56 Table of Contents UNS Gas and UNS Electric have the option of paying interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver contains restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, mergers and sales of assets; it also contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for each borrower. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were each in compliance with the terms of the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. If an event of default occurs, the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, certain change in control transactions, certain bankruptcy events of UNS Gas or UNS Electric, or failure of UES, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to make payments or default on debt greater than $4 million. UNS Gas expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Gas had no outstanding borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Gas has $100 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding consisting of $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2011 and $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2015 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas restricts transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens, restricted payments and incurrence of indebtedness, and also contains a minimum net worth test. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Gas must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Gas may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $7 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Gas Supply Contracts UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005. The agreement was automatically extended one year and will continue to extend on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. Prices for incremental gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the market prices for the period during which the gas is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas hedged approximately 48% of its expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March). Additionally, UNS Gas has approximately 36% of its expected gas consumption hedged for April through October 2007, and 29% hedged for the period November 2007 through March 2008. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. UNS Gas currently has a transportation agreement with EPNG to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. This agreement has specific contract volumes in each month and specific receipt point rights from the available supply basins (San Juan and Permian). The average daily capacity rights of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March). EPNG filed a rate case in 2005 with new, higher rates effective in January 2006, subject to refund. The rate case participants reached a negotiated settlement and filed an agreement with FERC on December 6, 2006. FERC is expected to take action on the settlement agreement in the first half of 2007. UNS Gas contract with EPNG expires in August 2011, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. K 57 Table of Contents UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. The current contract with Transwestern expires in February 2007. UNS Gas entered into a new firm transportation contract with Transwestern through February 2012 with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. The new capacity rights under this agreement are: 250,000 therms per day October through April; 15,000 therms per day in May; and 10,000 therms per day June through September. Transwestern filed a rate case in October 2006 with new, higher rates to be effective in April 2007. The rate case participants are attempting to negotiate a settlement prior to the new rates becoming effective. The aggregate annual minimum transportation charges are expected to be approximately $9 million and $2 million for the EPNG and Transwestern contracts, respectively. These costs are passed through to our customers via the PGA. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Gas may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Gas will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures. UNS ELECTRIC RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNS Electric reported net income of $5 million in 2006 and 2005, and $4 million in 2004. Similar to TEPs operations, we expect UNS Electrics operations to be seasonal in nature, with peak energy demand occurring in the summer months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had approximately 93,000 retail customers, a 4% increase from last year. Retail kWh sales were 6% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. The table below shows UNS Electrics kWh sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The plan addressed all aspects of implementation. It included UNS Electrics unbundled distribution tariffs for both standard offer customers and customers that choose competitive retail access, as well as Direct Access and Settlement Fee schedules. UNS Electrics direct access rates for both transmission and ancillary services would be based upon its FERC Open Access Transmission Tariff. The plan is subject to review and approval by the ACC, which has not yet considered the plan. As a result of the court decisions concerning the ACCs Rules, we are unable to predict when and how the ACC will address this plan. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Competition, above for information regarding the Arizona Court of Appeals decision. Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Electrics retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit to the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under or over recovery of costs. The ACC has approved a PPFAC surcharge of $0.01825 per kWh to recover transmission costs and the cost of the current full requirements power supply agreement with PWMT. General Rate Case Filing UNS Electrics retail rates were last adjusted in August 2003. As a result of increased growth in UNS Electrics service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Electric to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Electrics request: Test year 12 months ended June 30, 2006 Original cost rate base $141 million Revenue deficiency $8.5 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 5.5% Cost of long term debt 8.2% Cost of equity 11.8% Actual capital structure 49% equity / 51% debt Weighted average cost of capital 9.9% K 59 Table of Contents The procedural schedule for the UNS Electric rate case is as follows: Filing Date ACC Staff and Intervenor testimony June 28, 2007 UNS Electric rebuttal testimony August 14, 2007 ACC Staff and Intervenor surrebuttal August 24, 2007 UNS Electric rejoinder testimony August 31, 2007 Hearing before ALJ September 10, 2007 UNS Electric also requested the ACC to approve the acquisition of the 90 MW BMGS combustion turbine project under development by UED with a post test year rate base adjustment effective June 1, 2008. The cost of the BMGS is expected to cost $60 million. UNS Electric expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in late 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. UNS Electric also requested that a new PPFAC surcharge take effect when the current power supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff See, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Electrics capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $39 million. UNS Electric expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a portion of its construction expenditures. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Electrics general rate case that was filed in December 2006. In June 2006, UniSource Energy contributed $10 million of capital to UNS Electric. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 14 $ 21 $ 19 Capital Expenditures 39 30 19 To improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County, UNS Electric completed a 20 MW gas fired combustion turbine at the Valencia site in 2006, and plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time. The turbine improves reliability while the approval and permitting process for the 345 kV Tucson to Nogales transmission line continues. In 2006, UNS Electrics capital expenditures included $7 million related to the turbine. See Item 1. Business, TEP Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Electric are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Electric $43 $40 $42 $27 $34 K 60 Table of Contents UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver See UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver above for description of UNS Electrics unsecured revolving credit agreement. UNS Electric expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. At February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had $25 million outstanding under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Electric has $60 million of 7.61% senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2008 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreements for UNS Electric contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens to secure indebtedness, restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness, and minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Electric must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Electric may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $5 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Electric Power Supply and Transmission Contracts UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT), which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price per MWh. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric is in the process of securing replacement energy resources when its supply contract ends with PWMT in 2008. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $27 million. The new UNS Electric power purchase contracts are subject to master agreements whereby UNS Electric may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values or if there has been a material change in creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had not been required to post such credit enhancement. UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electrics transmission capacity agreements with WAPA provide for annual rate adjustments and expire in February 2008 and June 2011. The contract that expires in 2008 also contains a capacity adjustment clause. Under the terms of the agreements, UNS Electrics aggregated minimum fixed transmission charges are expected to be $12 million in 2007 through 2011. UNS Electric made payments under these contracts of $8 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Electric contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Electric may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Electric will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures. K 61 Table of Contents OTHER NON REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below summarizes the income (loss) for the Other non reportable segments in the last three years. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars UniSource Energy Parent Company $ (6 ) $ (6 ) $ (5 ) Gains on Millennium Investments 2 5 Losses on Millennium Investments (1 ) (3 ) (4 ) Millennium Investments Net (1 ) 1 UED (1 ) Total Other Loss From Continuing Operations $ (7 ) $ (7 ) $ (5 ) Discontinued Operations Net of Tax (2 ) (5 ) (5 ) Total Other Net Loss $ (9 ) $ (12 ) $ (10 ) UniSource Energy Parent Company UniSource Energy parent company expenses include interest expense (net of tax) related to the UniSource Energy Convertible Senior Notes, the UniSource Credit Agreement, and in 2004 and 2005, a note payable from UniSource Energy to TEP, which was repaid in March 2005. UED In 2006, UED purchased two electric generating turbines for $17 million. The turbines will be part of the 90 MW BMGS, to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, and, pending ACC approval is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. Construction is planned to begin during the third quarter of 2007 with an estimated completion date of May 2008. Including the purchase of the turbines, the total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $60 million. UED is financing the BMGS project with borrowings from UniSource Energy under an inter company note payable. At December 31, 2006, there was $22 million outstanding and interest is payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 1.25%. In 2005, UED had no significant operations. In 2004, UED recognized an impairment loss on its note receivable from an independent power producer. As UEDs recovery of the note receivable from the entity is subordinated to the rights of others, UED wrote off the entire $2 million balance due on the note at the time that Haddington, an investor in the independent power producer, determined that its investment was impaired. In 2004, UEDs net loss was $1 million. Discontinued Operations Global Solar Global Solar recorded losses of $2 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $5 million in 2004. On March 31, 2006, Millennium completed the sale of its interest in Global Solar. In these financial statements, UniSource Energy accounts for Global Solar as a discontinued operation and recognizes 100% of Global Solars losses. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Millennium Investments MEG is in the process of winding down its activities and does not expect to engage in any significant new activities. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of MEGs trading assets was $11 million and the fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million. Nations Energy Corporation (Nations Energy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, has been inactive since 2001. As of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, Nations Energy had a deferred tax asset of $3 million related to investment losses that has not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax return. K 62 Table of Contents Millennium is in the process of exiting its remaining investments. At December 31, 2006, the book value of Millenniums investments was $28 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Millennium made a $5 million dividend payment to UniSource Energy in February 2007 and is expected to make additional dividend payments totaling $10 million to UniSource Energy during the first half of 2007. In 2006, Millennium funded $2 million to Haddington under an existing commitment. In 2005, Haddington sold one of its investments and Millennium received a $6 million distribution related to the sale. In 2004, Millennium received a $7 million distribution from Haddington related to the gain on a sale of one of its investments. Millenniums remaining commitment is $1 million to Valley Ventures. In 2006, Millennium received the remaining payment of $5 million on a note receivable from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation and, in 2005, received a payment of $4 million. Millennium funded the remainder of its commitment to IPS in 2006. Millennium owns less than 10% of the equity of IPS. In 2005, Millennium received a $4 million payment from its investment in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V., (Sabinas) a Mexican limited liability company. The $4 million payment was treated as the return of capital and the book value of the investment in Sabinas was reduced to approximately $14 million. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. A $2 million payment due to Millennium in June 2006 was cancelled in exchange for payment by Mimosa, an affiliate of Sabinas, for up to $2 million to obtain a valuation of the interest in coal reserves and associated gas held by Mimosa. This evaluation is being performed under Millenniums direction, primarliy to determine the impact of current regulatory changes in Mexico on the value of the Sabinas investment. We expect the evaluation to be completed in 2007. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding required to fund Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. We believe such cash and returns will be adequate to fund Millenniums remaining commitments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. UniSource Energy and TEP consider Critical Accounting Estimates to be those that could result in materially different financial statement results if our assumptions regarding application of accounting principles were different. UniSource Energy and TEP describe their Critical Accounting Estimates below. Other significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates. Accounting for Rate Regulation TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric generally use the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (FAS 71), require special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to currently charge their customers to recover certain expenses, but instead may require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71 requires that TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are allowed to charge their customers. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then amortize these items as expense to the income statement as these charges are recovered from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced. The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of FAS 71 include: an independent regulator sets rates; the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering service; and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator. K 63 Table of Contents TEP Upon approval by the ACC of a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) in November 1999, TEP discontinued application of FAS 71 for its generation operations. TEP continues to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations, which include the transmission and distribution portions of its business. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $118 million at December 31, 2006. Regulatory assets of $61 million are not presently included in the rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. These regulatory assets are being recovered through the cost of service or are authorized to be collected in future base rates. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $163 million at December 31, 2005. TEP regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations. If TEP stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write off the related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2006, if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately $71 million. While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows, TEPs cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its regulatory assets. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $13 million at December 31, 2006 compared with regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities of $3 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electrics regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006 and $7 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electric has $11 million of regulatory liabilities and $1 million of regulatory assets that are not included in rate base. UNS Gas and UNS Electric regularly assess whether they can continue to apply FAS 71 to their cost based rate regulated operations. If UNS Gas and UNS Electric stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, they would write off the related balances of regulatory assets as an expense and regulatory liabilities as income on their income statements. Based on the balances of regulatory liabilities and assets at December 31, 2006, if UNS Gas and UNS Electric had stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, UNS Gas would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $8 million and UNS Electric would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $7 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics cash flows would not be affected if they stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited their ability to recover the cost of their regulatory assets. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, issued by the FASB, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred. A legal obligation is a liability that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract. A legal obligation can also be associated with the retirement of a long lived asset whose timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We are required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity should capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is adjusted to its present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the income statement each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the recorded amount. TEP In 2005, TEP implemented FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). The implementation of FIN 47 required TEP to update an existing inventory, originally created for the implementation of FAS 143, and to determine which, if any, of the conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated. The ability to reasonably estimate conditional asset retirement obligations was a matter of management judgment, based upon managements ability to estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, a method or potential method of settlement and probabilities associated with the potential dates and methods of settlement of TEPs conditional asset retirement obligations. In determining whether its conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated, management considered TEPs past practices, industry practices, managements intent and the estimated economic life of the assets. The fair value of the K 64 Table of Contents conditional asset retirement obligations were then estimated using an expected present value technique. Changes in managements assumptions regarding settlement dates, settlement methods or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liability recorded by TEP at December 31, 2006 as well as the associated cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded. The liabilities associated with conditional asset retirement obligations will be adjusted on an ongoing basis due to the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original estimates of undiscounted cash flows. These adjustments could have a significant impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information regarding the implementation and ongoing application of FIN 47, see Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Prior to implementing FAS 143, costs for final removal of all owned generation facilities were accrued as an additional component of depreciation expense. Under FAS 143, only the costs to remove an asset with legally binding retirement obligations will be accrued over time through accretion of the asset retirement obligation and depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had a liability of $4 million associated with its final asset retirement obligations. TEP has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets specified in land leases for its jointly owned Navajo and Four Corners Generating Stations. The land on which these stations reside is leased from the Navajo Nation. The provisions of the leases require the lessees to remove the facilities upon request of the Navajo Nation at the expiration of the leases. TEP also has certain environmental obligations at the San Juan Generating Station. TEP has estimated that its share of the cost to remove the Navajo and Four Corners facilities and settle the San Juan environmental obligations will be approximately $40 million at the date of retirement. No other legal obligations to retire generation plant assets were identified. In 2004, TEP, Phelps Dodge Energy Services, LLC and PNM Resources, Inc. each purchased from Duke Energy North America, LLC a one third interest in a limited liability company which owns the natural gas fired Luna Energy Facility (Luna) in Southern New Mexico. Luna is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was placed into commercial operation in April 2006. See Item 1. Business, Future Generating Resources TEP. The new owners assumed asset retirement obligations to remove certain piping and evaporation ponds and to restore the ground to its original condition. TEP has estimated its share to settle the obligations will be approximately $2 million at the date of retirement. TEP has various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. TEP operates its transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, TEP is not recognizing the costs of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had accrued $80 million for the net cost of removal for the interim retirements from its transmission, distribution and general plant. As of December 31, 2005, TEP had accrued $75 million for these removal costs. The amount is recorded as a regulatory liability. Amounts recorded under FAS 143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, estimating when final removal will occur, and the credit adjusted risk free interest rates to be used to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future as expense for asset retirement obligations. If TEP retires any asset at the end of its useful life, without a legal obligation to do so, it will record retirement costs at that time as incurred or accrued. TEP does not believe that the implementation of FAS 143 will result in any change in retail rates since all matters relating to the rate making treatment of TEPs generating assets have been determined pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric have various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. UNS Gas and UNS Electric operate their transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are not recognizing the cost of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. K 65 Table of Contents For the net cost of removal for interim retirements from transmission, distribution and general plant, UNS Gas accrued $4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $3 million as of December 31, 2005. UNS Electric accrued $2 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1 million as of December 31, 2005. The amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We record plan assets, obligations, and expenses related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions on discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries. TEP As a result of adopting FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in December 2006, TEP recognized the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability. The underfunded status was measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans. We expect volatility in the liability recognized in the balance sheet in future years as the funded status of our plans can change significantly due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience. The adjustment required to recognize the pension liability on adoption of this statement resulted in (i) recognition of a regulatory asset of $32 million representing a reasonable appropriation of the actuarial losses and prior service costs of TEPs pension plans that are probable of recovery in rates by its regulated operations in future periods and (ii) an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $17 million for our unregulated operations. We recorded the required increase in our other postretirement benefit obligation as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8 million as the ACC allows TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to recover other postretirement costs through rates only as benefit payments are made. Any change in the funded status of our plans due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience will be recognized as an adjustment to regulatory assets and other comprehensive income. TEP discounted its future pension plan obligations at 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP discounted its other postretirement plan obligations at a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP determines the discount rate annually based on the rates currently available on high quality, non callable, long term bonds. TEP looks to bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency whose future cash flows match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. For TEPs pension plans, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $7 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. A similar increase in the discount rate would decrease the PBO by approximately $8 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. For TEPs other postretirement benefit plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $2 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact plan expense by approximately $0.1 million. TEP calculates the market related value of plan assets using the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date. TEP assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.3% at December 31, 2006 and 8.5% at December 31, 2005. In establishing its assumption as to the expected return on plan assets, TEP reviews the plans asset allocation and develops return assumptions for each asset class based on advice from an investment consultant and the plans actuary that includes both historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets. Pension expense decreases as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases. A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact pension expense in 2007 by less than $0.5 million. TEP used an initial health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in valuing its postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2006. This rate reflects both market conditions and the plans experience. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A 1% increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. A similar decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. TEP will record pension expense of approximately $9 million and other postretirement benefit expense of $5 million ratably through 2007. TEP will make required pension plan K 66 Table of Contents contributions of $10 million in 2007. TEPs other postretirement benefit plan is not funded. TEP expects to make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $3 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted their future pension plan obligations using a rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. For UNS Gas and UNS Electrics pension plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact the benefit obligation and pension expense by less than $0.5 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record pension expense of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will make a pension plan contribution of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted its other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, compared with 5.8% at December 31, 2005. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record postretirement medical benefit expense and make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $0.1 million in 2007. Accounting for Derivative Instruments, Trading Activities and Hedging Activities A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from another investment or designated benchmark. TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically for one month, three months, or one year, within established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources (e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods). TEP enters into forward sales contracts when it forecasts that it has excess supply and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. A portion of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. However, some of these forward contracts which are derivatives satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Common Stock Equity, rather than being reflected in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments can be accounted for under multiple methods depending upon facts and circumstances, which can lead to variability in earnings. TEP has a natural gas supply agreement, that expires in February 2007, under which it purchases its gas requirements for its generating units located in Tucson, Arizona at spot market prices. TEP also has agreements to purchase power that are priced using spot market gas prices. These contracts meet the definition of normal purchases and are not required to be marked to market. In an effort to minimize price risk on these purchases, TEP enters into commodity price swap agreements under which TEP purchases gas at fixed prices and simultaneously sells gas at spot market prices. The spot market price in the swap agreements is tied to the same index as the purchases under the natural gas supply and purchased power contracts. These swap agreements, which expire during the summer months through 2009, were entered into with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of TEPs expected summer monthly gas risk prior to entering into the month. The swap agreements are marked to market on a monthly basis; however, since the agreements satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income rather than being reflected in the income statement. In June 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap in order to reduce the risk associated with unfavorable changes in variable interest rate payments related to changes in LIBOR. The swap has the effect of converting approximately $37 million of variable rate lease payments for the Springerville Common Lease to a fixed rate. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the interest rate swap is derived from models based on well recognized financial principles, which provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the swap as of the valuation date. Other models can be used to estimate the fair value of the swap and these models, which may use different assumptions or methods, may yield different results. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the swap is a liability of $2 million. TEP manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standardized agreement, which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. UNS Gas does not currently have any contracts that are required to be marked to market. UNS Gas does have a natural gas supply and management agreement under which it purchases substantially all of its gas requirements K 67 Table of Contents at market prices from BP Energy Company (BP). However, the contract terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its gas purchases by entering into fixed price forward contracts with BP at various times during the year. This enables UNS Gas to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of the expected monthly gas consumption prior to entering into the month. These forward contracts, as well as the main gas supply contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and therefore are not required to be marked to market. UNS Electric presently has a full requirements power supply agreement that enables it to meet its load. The agreement expires May 31, 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. In order to reduce exposure to energy price risk resulting from the procurement of power, UNS Electric has entered into forward power purchase contracts for specified amounts of energy at specified prices over a given period of time, within established limits. UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative and are marked to market by recording unrealized gains or losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In December 2006, the ACC issued an order allowing UNS Electric to record the unrealized net gains or losses as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. MEG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to Emission Allowances. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In accordance with UniSource Energys intention to cease making capital contributions to Millennium, Millennium has significantly reduced the holdings and activity of MEG. MEGs activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP, UNS Electric and MEGs derivative instruments at December 31, 2006, are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value. For TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. For MEGs remaining trading contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $0.1 million. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG). To date, the DIG has issued more than 100 interpretations to provide guidance in applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). As the DIG or the FASB continues to issue interpretations, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may change the conclusions they have reached and, as a result, the accounting treatment and financial statement impact could change in the future. See Market Risks Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A. K 68 Table of Contents Unbilled Revenue TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric TEPs, UNS Gass and UNS Electrics retail revenues include an estimate of MWhs/therms delivered but unbilled at the end of each period. Unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require managements judgment including estimates of retail sales and customer usage patterns. The unbilled revenue is estimated by comparing the estimated MWhs/therms delivered to the MWhs/therms billed to TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric retail customers. The excess of estimated MWhs/therms delivered over MWhs/therms billed is then allocated to the retail customer classes based on estimated usage by each customer class. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then record revenue for each customer class based on the various bill rates for each customer class. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of TEPs actual load, the unbilled revenue amount increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. The unbilled revenue amount for UNS Gas sales increases during the fall and winter months and decreases during the spring and summer months, whereas, the unbilled revenue amount for UNS Electric sales increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. Plant Asset Depreciable Lives TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric We calculate depreciation expense based on our estimate of the useful lives of our plant assets. The estimated useful lives, and resulting depreciation rates used to calculate depreciation expense for the transmission and distribution businesses of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have been approved by the ACC in prior rate decisions. Depreciation rates for transmission and distribution cannot be changed without ACC approval. The estimated remaining useful lives of TEPs generating facilities are based on managements best estimate of the economic life of the units. These estimates are based on engineering estimates, economic analysis, and statistical analysis of TEPs past experience in maintaining the stations. Our generation assets are currently depreciated over periods ranging from 23 to 70 years from the original in service dates. During the second quarter of 2005, a study requested by the participants in the San Juan Generating Station was completed which indicated San Juans economic useful life had changed from previous estimates. As a result of the study and other analysis performed, TEP lengthened the estimated useful life of San Juan from 40 to 60 years beginning April 1, 2005. TEPs annual depreciation expense related to San Juan decreased by $6 million as a result. During the first quarter of 2004, TEP engaged an independent third party to review the economic estimated useful lives of its owned generating assets in Springerville, Arizona. TEP then hired another independent third party to perform a depreciation study for its generation assets, taking into consideration the newly determined economic useful life for the Springerville assets, and changes in generation plant life information used by the operators and other participants of the joint power plants in which TEP participates. As a result of these analyses, TEP lengthened the useful lives of various generation assets for periods ranging from 11 to 22 years in July 2004. Consequently, depreciation rates and the corresponding depreciation expense have been revised prospectively to reflect the life extensions. The annual impact of these changes in depreciation rates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $9 million. Deferred Tax Valuation We record deferred tax liabilities for amounts that will increase income taxes on future tax returns. We record deferred tax assets for amounts that could be used to reduce income taxes on future tax returns. We record a valuation allowance, or reserve, for the deferred tax asset amount that we may not be able to use on future tax returns. We estimate the valuation allowance based on our interpretation of the tax rules, prior tax audits, tax planning strategies, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future taxable income. At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy had no valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, UniSource Energy had a valuation allowance of $7 million relating to net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amounts. The $7 million valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2005, relates to losses generated by the Millennium entities. As a result of the sale of Global Solar, the NOL and related valuation allowance were removed from the UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, UniSource Energys deferred income tax assets include $7 million and $9 million, respectively, related to unregulated investment losses of Millennium. These losses have not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax returns. If UniSource Energy were unable to K 69 Table of Contents recognize such losses through its consolidated income tax return in the foreseeable future, UniSource Energy would be required to write off these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, TEP had no valuation allowance. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB recently issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), FASB Interpretations (FIN), FASB Staff Positions (FSP), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issues (EITF): EITF 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation), approved June 2006, requires that we disclose our accounting policy regarding presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. Additionally, we must disclose the amounts of any taxes reported on a gross basis in interim and annual financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosures. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS 109, issued July 2006, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 requires disclosure of a rollforward of total unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. TEP recognized between $1 million and $2 million of income as an increase to Common Stock Equity on January 1, 2007 on the adoption of FIN 48. FAS 157, Fair Value Measurement, issued September 2006, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 clarifies that the exchange price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. We are required to disclose inputs used to develop fair value measurements and the effect of any of our assumptions on earnings or changes in net assets for the period. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our financial statements, and will incorporate these additional disclosure requirements in our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, issued September 2006, prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As we do not accrue planned major maintenance activities in advance, we anticipate no impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this FSP. FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, issued September 2006, requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and benefit obligation. FAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the incremental effect of adopting FAS 158. In the third quarter of 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law, which will be effective January 1, 2008. The new law will affect the manner in which many companies, including UniSource Energy and TEP, administer their pension plans. The legislation will require companies to increase the amount by which they fund their pension plans, increase premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for defined benefit plans, amend plan documents and provide additional disclosures in regulatory filings and to plan participants. We are currently assessing the impact it may have on our financial statements. SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. UniSource Energy and TEP are including the following cautionary statements to K 70 Table of Contents make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward looking statements made by or for UniSource Energy or TEP in this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions with respect to financing and rate structures. 8. Changes affecting the cost of competing energy alternatives, including changes in available generating technologies and changes in the cost of natural gas. 9. Changes in accounting principles or the application of such principles to our businesses. 10. Changes in the depreciable lives of our assets. 11. Unanticipated changes in future liabilities relating to employee benefit plans due to changes in market values of retirement plan assets and health care costs. 12. The outcome of any ongoing or future litigation. 13. Ability to obtain financing through debt and or equity issuance, which can be affected by various factors, including interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks We are exposed to various forms of market risk. Changes in interest rates, returns on marketable securities, and changes in commodity prices may affect our future financial results. K 71 Table of Contents For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements, above. Risk Management Committee We have a Risk Management Committee responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to the wholesale energy marketing activities of TEP, the emissions and trading activities of MEG, and the fuel and power procurement activities at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. Our Risk Management Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis and as needed, consists of officers from the finance, accounting, legal, wholesale marketing, transmission and distribution operations, and the generation operations departments of UniSource Energy. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to commodity price risk, the Risk Management Committee sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to credit risk, the Risk Management Committee reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits. Interest Rate Risk TEP is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on certain of its variable rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEPs debt included $329 million of tax exempt variable rate debt. The average interest rate on TEPs variable rate debt (excluding letter of credit fees) was 3.47% in 2006 and 2.48% in 2005. In June 2006, TEP refinanced variable rate lease debt totaling $68 million related to its Springerville Common Facilities Leases. The notes underlying the leases mature in June 2017 and January 2020. The notes were amended to provide that interest will be payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The interest rate in effect on the lease debt was 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. A 1% increase (decrease) in average interest rates would result in a decrease (increase) in TEPs pre tax income by approximately $4 million. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. Marketable Securities Risk TEP is exposed to fluctuations in the return on its marketable securities, which is comprised of investments in debt securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEP had marketable debt securities with an estimated fair value of $139 million and $165 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These debt securities represent TEPs investments in lease debt underlying certain of TEPs capital lease obligations. Changes in the fair value of such debt securities do not present a material risk to TEP, as TEP intends to hold these investments to maturity. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances. TEP Purchases and Sales of Energy To manage its exposure to energy price risk, TEP enters into forward contracts to buy or sell energy at a specified price and future delivery period. Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected excess generating capability, forward prices and generation costs, using a diversified market approach to provide a balance between long term, mid term and spot energy sales. TEP generally enters into forward purchases during its summer peaking period to ensure it can meet its load and reserve requirements and account for other contracts and resource contingencies. TEP also enters into limited forward purchases and sales to optimize its resource portfolio and take advantage of locational differences in price. These positions are managed on both a volumetric and dollar basis and are closely monitored using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk K 72 Table of Contents Management Committee. For example, the risk management policies provide that TEP should not take a short position in the third quarter and must have owned generation backing up all forward sales positions at the time the sale is made. TEPs risk management policies also restrict entering into forward positions with maturities extending beyond the end of the next calendar year except for approved hedging purposes. The majority of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales of electric energy and are not considered to be derivatives under FAS 133. TEP records revenues on its normal sales and expenses on its normal purchases in the period in which the energy is delivered. From time to time, however, TEP enters into forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. When TEP has derivative forward contracts, it marks them to market using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers for power traded over the counter at Palo Verde and at other southwestern U.S. trading hubs. TEP believes that these broker quotations used to calculate the mark to market values represent accurate measures of the fair values of TEPs positions because of the short term nature of TEPs positions, as limited by risk management policies, and the liquidity in the short term market. To adjust the value of its derivative forward power sales and purchases, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $6 $(1) $ TEP also reported the following net unrealized gains and losses on forward power sales and purchases in Wholesale Sales and Purchased Power. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $1 $(1) $2 TEP uses sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an unfavorable change in market prices on the fair value of its derivative forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Natural Gas TEP is also subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of natural gas. In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and to meet local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchase power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. In 2006, the average market price of natural gas was $6.05 per MMBtu, or 16% lower than 2005. The table below summarizes TEPs gas generation output and purchased power for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of MWhs % of Total Resources Gas Fired Generation 848 368 432 6% 3% 3% Purchased Power 1,644 1,639 1,322 12% 13% 10% K 73 Table of Contents To adjust the value of its derivative gas swap contracts, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Unrealized Gain (Loss) $(17) $11 $3 As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. Coal TEP is subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of coal used to fuel its coal fired generating plants. In 2003, TEP amended and extended the long term coal supply contract for Springerville Units 1 and 2 through 2020 and expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. During the extension period from 2011 through 2020, the coal price will be determined by the cost of Powder River Basin coal delivered to Springerville Unit 3 subject to a floor and ceiling. Based on current coal market conditions, this range would be from $24 to $30 per ton. TEP estimates its future minimum annual payments under this contract to be $45 million through 2010, the initial contract expiration date, and $14 million from 2011 through 2020. TEPs coal transportation contract at Springerville runs through June of 2011. TEP estimates minimum annual payments under this contract to be $13 million through 2010 and $7 million in 2011. In December 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through December 2008. Although TEP expects to pay $20 million annually, the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. In 2007, the impact on TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants is expected to increase by $17 million, or 9%. The long term rail contract for Sundt Unit 4 is in effect until the earliest of 2015, the remaining life of Sundt Unit 4 or the life of the coal mine. This rail contract requires TEP to transport at least 75,000 tons of coal per year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $2 million or to make a minimum payment of $1 million. TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan, where coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. In 2003, the Four Corners coal contract was extended through July 2016. This contract requires TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated annual cost of $6 million. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. The contracts to purchase coal for use at the jointly owned facilities require TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated average annual cost of $21 million for the next five years.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. UNS Gas UNS Gas is subject to commodity price risk, primarily from the changes in the price of natural gas purchased for its customers. This risk is mitigated through the PGA mechanism which provides an adjustment to UNS Gas retail rates to recover the actual costs of gas and transportation. UNS Gas further reduces this risk by purchasing forward fixed price contracts for a portion of its projected gas needs under its Price Stabilization Plan. UNS Gas purchases at least 45% of its estimated gas needs in this manner. UNS Electric UNS Electric is currently not exposed to commodity price risk for its purchase of electricity as it has a fixed price full requirements supply agreement with PWMT and a PPFAC mechanism which fully recovers the costs incurred K 74 Table of Contents under such contract on a timely basis. This supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $23 million. Because a portion of the costs under these contracts will vary from period to period based on the market price of gas, the PPFAC, as currently structured, may not provide recovery of the costs incurred under these new contracts on a timely basis. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. MEG MEG trades Emission Allowances and related instruments; however, its current activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. We manage the market risk of this line of business by setting notional limits by product, as well as limits to the potential change in fair market value under a 33% change in price or volatility. We closely monitor MEGs trading activities, which include swap agreements, options and forward contracts, using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk Management Committee. MEG marks its trading positions to market on a daily basis using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers and options pricing models for positions that extend through 2007. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the fair value of MEGs trading assets combined with Emission Allowances it holds in escrow was $11 million and $38 million, respectively. The fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million at December 31, 2006 and $24 million at December 31, 2005. For 2006, MEG reflected a $10 million unrealized loss and a $10 million realized gain on its income statement, compared with an unrealized gain of $11 million and a realized loss of $11 million in the same period last year. For MEGs remaining trading contracts at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $1 million.

Total Unrealized Gain (Loss) Prices actively quoted $ 4 $ 2 $ $ 6 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 3 3 Total $ 4 $ 5 $ $ 9 Credit Risk UniSource Energy is exposed to credit risk in its energy related marketing and trading activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. We manage the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standard agreement which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. We calculate counterparty credit exposure by adding any outstanding receivable (net of amounts payable if a netting agreement exists) to the mark to market value of any forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, TEPs total credit exposure related to its wholesale marketing and gas hedging activities was approximately $34 million. Approximately $2 million of TEPs exposure is to non investment grade companies. TEP had five counterparties with exposures of greater than 10% of its total credit exposure, totaling approximately $23 million. MEGs total credit exposure related to its trading activities was $5 million and was concentrated primarily with two counterparties. MEG has no credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties. UNS Gas is subject to credit risk from non performance by its supply counterparty, BP Energy (BP), to the extent that this contract has a mark to market value in favor of UNS Gas. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas K 75 Table of Contents has purchased under fixed price contracts approximately 48% of the expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March) and approximately 29% of its expected consumption for the 2007/2008 winter season. At December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had no credit exposure under its supply contract with BP. UNS Electric has begun to enter into energy purchase agreements to replace the full requirements contract it has with PWMT that expires in May 2008. To the extent that such contracts have a positive mark to market value, UNS Electric would be exposed to credit risk under those contracts. At December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had less than $1 million in credit exposure under such contracts.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, for more information regarding the Springerville and Sundt leases. K 4 Table of Contents Luna Energy Facility The Luna Energy Facility (Luna), located in southern New Mexico, is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was completed in April 2006. TEPs one third share of the plants capacity is 190 MW. Luna allows TEP to displace some of its less efficient gas fired generation and purchased power requirements and to make additional short term energy sales in the wholesale market. TEPs total investment of $49 million was funded with internal cash. Purchases and Interconnections TEP purchases power from other utilities and power marketers. TEP may enter into contracts: (a) to purchase energy under long term contracts to serve retail load and long term wholesale contracts, (b) to purchase capacity or energy during periods of planned outages or for peak summer load conditions, and (c) to purchase energy for resale to certain wholesale customers under load and resource management agreements. Finally, TEP may purchase energy in the daily and hourly markets to meet higher than anticipated demands, to cover unplanned generation outages, or when it is more economical than generating its own energy. TEP is a member of various regional reserve sharing, reliability and power sharing organizations. These relationships allow TEP to call upon other utilities during emergencies, such as plant outages and system disturbances, and reduce the amount of reserves TEP is required to carry. Springerville Units 3 and 4 In conjunction with the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station, TEP entered into a contract to purchase up to 100 MW of capacity of system resources from Tri State Generation and Transmission Association (Tri State), which leases 100% of the 400 MW Springerville Unit 3 from a financial owner. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Springerville Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired plant at the Springerville site. Under certain conditions, TEP would be required to purchase 100 MW of Unit 4 capacity from SRP. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Springerville Units 3 and 4.

Peak demand occurs during the summer months due to the cooling requirements of TEPs retail customers. Retail peak demand has grown at an average annual rate of approximately 6% from 2002 to 2006. The chart above shows the relationship over a five year period between TEPs peak demand and its energy resources. TEPs margin is the difference between total energy resources and coincident peak demand, and the reserve margin is the ratio of margin to coincident peak demand. TEP maintains a minimum reserve margin in excess of 7% to comply with reliability criteria set forth by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. TEPs actual reserve margin in 2006 was 8%. Forecasted retail peak demand for 2007 is approximately 2,476 MW, compared with actual peak demand of 2,365 MW in 2006. Except for certain peak hours during the summer, TEP believes it will have sufficient resources to meet expected demand in 2007 with its existing generation capacity and power purchase agreements. K 5 Table of Contents Future Generating Resources TEP will continue to add peaking resources to serve the Tucson area as needed based upon our forecasts of retail and firm wholesale load, as well as statewide transmission infrastructure. TEP currently forecasts that it may need additional peaking resources of 150 MW in 2015. FUEL SUPPLY Fuel Summary Fuel cost and usage information is provided below on a delivered to the boiler basis: Average Cost per MMBtu Percentage of Total Btu Consumed Consumed 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Coal $1.69 $1.69 $1.57 94% 96% 96% Gas $7.03 $8.09 $6.75 6% 4% 4% All Fuels $2.03 $1.93 $1.79 100% 100% 100% Coal TEPs principal fuel for electric generation is low sulfur, bituminous or sub bituminous coal from mines in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. The majority of its coal supplies are purchased under long term contracts, which result in more predictable prices. The average cost per ton of coal, including transportation for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $32.36, $32.43, and $30.20, respectively.

TEP Operated Generating Facilities TEP is the sole owner (or lessee) and operator of the Springerville Units 1 and 2 and Sundt Unit 4 Generating Stations. The coal supplies for the Springerville Units 1 and 2 are transported approximately 200 miles by railroad from Northwestern New Mexico. TEP expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. The coal supply agreement for Sundt Unit 4 expired on December 31, 2006. On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The coal supplies are transported approximately 1,300 miles by railroad from Colorado. The cost of coal and transportation under the new agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. TEP expects to pay approximately $20 million annually, compared with approximately $14 million annually under the old agreement, however the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. K 6 Table of Contents Generating Facilities Operated by Others TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan. These are mine mouth generating stations located adjacent to the coal reserves. The coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. Natural Gas Supply TEP typically uses generation from its facilities fueled by natural gas and purchased power, in addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchased power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs from the Permian Basin, and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. TEP entered into a Gas Procurement Agreement with Southwest Gas Corporation (SWG) in 2001, with a primary term of five years. Starting January 1, 2006, interim supply terms were put into place on a month to month basis until terminated by either party with 30 days notice and did not include a minimum volume obligation. SWG provided notice to TEP to terminate this agreement effective February 28, 2007. TEP is currently negotiating a new contract and tariff terms with SWG for supply to its Tucson gas plants starting March 1, 2007, as well as evaluating other supply options. TEP does not expect any gas supply disruptions to its plants. TEP purchased gas transportation for Luna from El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) from the Permian basin to the plant site. The initial term of this agreement is from February 2006 to January 2009, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. WATER SUPPLY The Four Corners region of New Mexico, where the San Juan and Four Corners Generating Stations are located, experienced drought conditions in 2002 through 2004 that could have affected the water supply for these plants. TEP has a 50% ownership interest in each of San Juan Units 1 and 2 (322 MW capacity) and a 7% ownership interest in each of Four Corners Units 4 and 5 (110 MW capacity). In future years, drought conditions may affect the water supply of the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area. The operating agents for San Juan and Four Corners have negotiated supplemental water contracts with BHP Billiton and the Jicarilla Apache Nation to assist the generating plants in meeting their water requirements in the event of a shortage. Drought conditions within the southwestern region, combined with increased water usage in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, have caused water levels to recede at Lake Powell, which supplies operating water for the Navajo Generating Station. TEP has a 7.5% ownership interest in Navajo Units 1, 2 and 3 (168 MW capacity). The operating agent for Navajo, along with the other plant owners, are evaluating options to ensure adequate water supply is available in the event drought conditions adversely affect the water level at Lake Powell. TRANSMISSION ACCESS TEP has transmission access and power transaction arrangements with over 120 electric systems or suppliers. TEP is taking steps to increase the capacity and reliability of its transmission and distribution system. In 2004, TEP completed a 500 kV connection that increased its energy import capability from the region, allowing TEP to decrease the use of its less efficient gas generating units in favor of more economical purchases of energy in the wholesale market. TEP also has various ongoing projects that are designed to increase access to the regional wholesale energy market and improve the reliability and efficiency of its existing transmission and distribution systems. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line TEP and UNS Electric are parties to a project development agreement for the joint construction of a 62 mile transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona. The project was initiated in response to an order by the ACC to improve reliability to UNS Electrics retail customers in Nogales, Arizona. K 7 Table of Contents In 2002, the ACC approved the location and construction of the proposed 345 kV transmission line along the Western Corridor route subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining all required permits from state and federal agencies. TEP is currently seeking approvals for the project from the Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The DOE has completed a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project in which it would accept any of the routes in the EIS but the U.S. Forest Service has indicated the Central route as its preferred alternative, rather than the Western Corridor route. Based on the alternative proposals and passage of time since it approved the location of the line, the ACC, in 2005, ordered TEP to review the status of electric service reliability in Nogales, Arizona and the need for the 345 kV transmission line. The ACC also indicated that it would review any new information regarding the location of the proposed transmission line. In 2005, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for the ACC issued a recommended opinion and order reaffirming the ACCs original position requiring the construction of the Tucson to Nogales transmission line. After a hearing on the issue in February 2006, the ACC directed the ALJ to amend the recommendation to direct the Line Siting Committee of the ACC to gather facts related to options for improving service reliability in Nogales, Arizona. TEP expects the ALJ to issue, and the ACC to address, an amended recommended opinion and order related to the Nogales transmission line in 2007. RATES AND REGULATION The FERC and the ACC regulate portions of TEPs utility accounting practices and electricity rates. The FERC regulates the terms and prices of TEPs transmission services and wholesale electricity sales. In 1996, TEP filed a tariff at FERC governing the rates, terms and conditions of open access transmission services. In 1997, TEP was granted a FERC tariff to sell power at market based rates. The ACC has authority over rates charged to retail customers, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. State Historically, the ACC determined TEPs rates for retail sales of electric energy on a cost of service basis, which was designed to provide, after recovery of allowable operating expenses, an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on TEPs fair value rate base. Fair value rate base was generally determined by reference to the original cost and the reconstruction cost (net of depreciation) of utility plant in service to the extent deemed used and useful, and to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items, plus a working capital component. Over time, additions to utility plant in service increased rate base and depreciation and retirements of utility plant reduced rate base. Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Retail Electric Competition Rules (Rules) that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Rates, for more information. Arizona Court of Appeals Decision Invalidating Certain Retail Electric Competition Rules In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. Based on this decision, we expect that the ACC will address the competition rules in an administrative proceeding. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Competition, for more information.

TEP believes that all existing facilities are in compliance and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. Federal Clean Air Act Amendments The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), through the Acid Rain Program, requires reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions; this affects all of TEPs generating facilities (except 142 MW of its internal combustion turbines). TEPs generating units affected by CAAA Phase II have been allocated SO2 Emission Allowances based on past operational history. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO2. Generating units subject to CAAA Phase II must hold Emission Allowances equal to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset excess emissions in future years. TEP has Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to comply with the CAAA Phase II SO2 regulations. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. Potential changes to the allocation of SO2 allowances may impact these expectations in future years. Title V of the CAAA requires that all of TEPs generating facilities obtain more stringent air quality permits. All TEP facilities (including those jointly owned and operated by others) have obtained these permits. TEP received a new Title V permit for the Springerville generating station in 2006. TEP expects that a new Title V permit will be issued for the Sundt generating station in 2007. Because TEP has submitted a permit renewal application for the Sundt facility, under its Title V permit, TEP can continue to operate the plant. TEP must pay an annual emission based fee for each generating facility subject to a Title V permit. These emission based fees are included in the CAAA compliance expenses discussed below. The CAAA also requires multi year studies of visibility impairment in specified areas and studies of hazardous air pollutants. The results of these studies will impact the development of future regulation of electric utility generating units. Mercury Emissions In 2005, the EPA adopted regulations relating to mercury emissions requiring states to develop rules for implementing federal requirements. Arizona adopted its mercury emission limits in 2007 and TEP must meet these limits by 2013. TEP is analyzing the potential impact of the Arizona regulations on its operations but does not expect the capital costs to exceed $5 million. TEP is also monitoring the New Mexico and Navajo Nation mercury emission regulations affecting plants for which TEP has an ownership share. Until these state procedures are adopted, TEP cannot determine if it will be significantly affected. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies are considering the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. At this time, we do not know whether any such regulations will be adopted, the scope of such regulations or how any such regulations could affect our operations. K 10 Table of Contents Regional Haze The EPAs Regional Haze Rule requires states to develop plans to restore visibility in Federal Class I Areas (such as parks, monuments and wilderness areas) to their natural conditions by 2064. State plans must be submitted to the EPA in December 2007, could require pollution control upgrades at some of TEPs power plants. The level of control required, if any, will not be known until the state plans are submitted and approved by EPA. If required, controls would need to be in place by 2013 or later. TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may reduce operating efficiency. State Regulations Arizona and New Mexico have adopted regulations restricting the emissions from existing and future coal, oil and gas fired plants. TEP believes that all existing generating facilities are in compliance with all existing state regulations. These regulations are in some instances more stringent than those adopted by the EPA. The principal generating units of TEP are located relatively close to national parks, monuments, wilderness areas and Indian reservations. These areas have relatively high air quality and TEP could be subject to control standards that relate to the prevention of significant deterioration of visibility and tall stack limitation rules. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Contingencies, Litigation and Claims Related to San Juan Generating Station. In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate 15% of their total energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025. To offset the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the REST rules allow a change in the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, TEP, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, for more information. Capital and Operating Costs TEP capitalized $1 million in 2006, $1 million in 2005 and $9 million in 2004 in construction costs to comply with environmental requirements and expects to capitalize $18 million in 2007 and $42 million in 2008. The increase in environmental capital expenditures in 2007 and 2008 is due primarily to pollution control upgrades to be made at San Juan. TEP recorded expenses of $10 million in 2006, $11 million in 2005 and $9 million in 2004 related to environmental compliance, including the cost of lime used to scrub the stack gas. TEP expects environmental expenses to be $11 million in 2007. TEP may incur additional costs to comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating facilities. Compliance with these changes may result in a reduction in operating efficiency. In order to meet Title V permit requirements in connection with the construction of Springerville Unit 3, the Unit 3 project paid approximately $90 million for upgrades to pollution control equipment on Springerville Units 1 and 2 and common facilities. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, Resolution of Springerville Generating Station Complaint. UNS GAS SERVICE TERRITORY AND CUSTOMERS UNS Gas is a gas distribution company serving approximately 145,000 retail customers in Mohave, Yavapai, Coconino, and Navajo counties in Northern Arizona, as well as Santa Cruz County in Southeast Arizona. These counties comprise approximately 50% of the territory in the state of Arizona, with a population of approximately 773,000 in 2006. UNS Gas customer base is primarily residential. Total revenues derived from residential customers were approximately 61% in 2006, while sales to other retail customer classes accounted for approximately 30% of total revenues. Approximately 9% of total revenues in 2006 were derived from gas transportation services and a Negotiated Sales Program (NSP). UNS Gas supplies natural gas transportation service to the 600 MW Griffith Power Plant located near Kingman, Arizona, under a 20 year contract which expires in 2021. UNS Gas also supplies natural gas to some of its large transportation customers through an NSP approved by the ACC. One half K 11 Table of Contents of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas, while the other half benefits retail customers through a credit to the purchased gas adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. GAS SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005, but the agreement automatically extends for one year on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. The market price for gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the period during which the commodity is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas buys most of the gas it distributes from the San Juan Basin in the Four Corners region. The gas is delivered on the El Paso and Transwestern interstate pipeline systems. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its customers demands. With EPNG, the average daily capacity right of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March) to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, UNS Gas Supply Contracts, for more information. RATES AND REGULATION The ACC regulates UNS Gas with respect to retail gas rates, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. UNS Gas retail gas rates include a monthly customer charge, a base rate charge for delivery services and the cost of gas (expressed in cents per therm), and a PGA. Purchased Gas Adjustor The PGA mechanism is intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or returned to customers through the PGA mechanism. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, for more information. General Rate Case In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case to recover the costs related to serving its growing customer base. UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Gas, Rates, for more information. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS UNS Gas is subject to environmental regulation of air and water quality, resource extraction, waste disposal and land use by federal, state and local authorities. UNS Gas believes that all existing facilities are in compliance with all existing regulations and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. K 12 Table of Contents UNS ELECTRIC SERVICE TERRITORY AND CUSTOMERS UNS Electric is an electric transmission and distribution company serving approximately 93,000 retail customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz Counties. These counties had a population of approximately 240,000 in 2006. UNS Electrics customer base is primarily residential, with some small commercial and both light and heavy industrial customers. Peak demand for 2006 was 417 MW. POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION Power Supply UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT) which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric owns and operates the Valencia Power Plant (Valencia), located in Nogales, Arizona. Valencia consists of four gas and diesel fueled combustion turbine units and provides approximately 68 MW of peaking resources. This includes a 20 MW unit installed in 2006. The facility is directly interconnected with the distribution system serving the city of Nogales and the surrounding areas. Under the PWMT agreement, Valencia will be dispatched by PWMT when needed for local reliability or when it is economic relative to other PWMT resources. Transmission UNS Electric imports the power it purchases from PWMT into its Mohave County and Santa Cruz County service territories over Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electric is currently negotiating a network transmission service agreement to replace its primary transmission capacity agreement with WAPA for the Parker Davis system that expires in February 2008. The new agreement is expected to have no expiration date and be effective by the end of the first quarter of 2007. UNS Electric also has a long term electric point to point transmission capacity agreement with WAPA for the Southwest Intertie system that expires in 2011. UNS Electric plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time to improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County. Future Power Supply UNS Electric is in the process of evaluating and securing power supply resources to ensure adequate resources are in place when its PWMT agreement expires in May 2008. In 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods for one to five years beginning in June 2008. In addition, as part of its general rate case filing, UNS Electric included a proposal to purchase the 90 MW Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS) in 2008, which is under development by UED. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had 28% of its total expected resource needs for June 2008; this includes purchased power contracts as well as generating assets. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations and Other, UED, below for more information. RATES AND REGULATION UNS Electric is regulated by the ACC with respect to retail electric rates, quality of service, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated parties, and by the FERC with respect to wholesale power contracts and interstate transmission service. UNS Electrics retail electric rates include a purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC), which allows for UNS Electric to recover the actual costs of its power purchases. General Rate Case In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case to recover the costs related to serving its growing customer base. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UNS Electric, Rates, for more information. K 13 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS UNS Electric is subject to environmental regulation of air and water quality, resource extraction, waste disposal and land use by federal, state and local authorities. UNS Electric believes that all existing facilities are in compliance with all existing regulations and will be in compliance with expected environmental regulations. Like TEP, UNS Electric is subject to the ACCs REST rules. See TEP Electric Utility Operations, Environmental Matters, State Regulation, above. OTHER UED UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the 90 MW gas fired BMGS in Kingman, Arizona. In October 2006, UED purchased two electric generating gas turbines that will be part of the BMGS. Completion of the project is estimated to occur in May 2008. Pending ACC approval, BMGS is expected to be used as a resource for UNS Electric. Millennium Investments Through affiliates, Millennium holds investments in unregulated energy and emerging technology companies. At December 31, 2006, Millenniums assets represented 3% of UniSource Energys total assets. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding for Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Other, Liquidity and Capital Resources. Consolidated Millennium Investments Southwest Energy Solutions, Inc. (SES), a wholly owned Millennium subsidiary, provides electrical contracting services in Arizona to commercial, industrial and governmental customers in both high voltage and inside wiring capacities. SES also provides meter reading services to TEP and UNS Electric. Millennium Environmental Group, Inc. (MEG), a wholly owned Millennium subsidiary, manages and trades emission allowances and other environmental related products, including derivative instruments. MEG is in the process of winding down its activities and does not anticipate engaging in any significant new activities. Nations Energy Corporation (Nations Energy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, has been inactive since 2001. Equity Method Millennium Investments Haddington Energy Partners II, LP (Haddington) is a limited partnership that funds energy related investments. A member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors has an investment in Haddington, has a non management advisory role with respect to Haddington Ventures, LLP, a limited partnership that is the general partner of Haddington, and also is a voting member of the investment committee that makes decisions with respect to investments in Haddington. Millennium committed $15 million in capital, excluding fees, to Haddington in exchange for approximately 31% ownership. As of December 31, 2006, Millennium had invested $15 million in Haddington since its inception, and received distributions of $15 million. Millennium has no remaining commitment to Haddington. Millenniums total investment balance in Haddington at December 31, 2006 was $5 million. Valley Ventures III, LP (Valley Ventures) is a venture capital fund that focuses on investments in information technology, microelectronics and biotechnology, primarily within the southwestern U.S. Another member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors was a general partner of the company that manages the fund until January 1, 2006, at which time the Board member terminated his role and interest as a general partner but maintained a non voting financial interest in the company. Millennium committed $6 million, including fees, to the fund and owns approximately 15% of the fund. As of December 31, 2006, Millennium has not received any distributions from Valley Ventures and had $1 million remaining on this commitment, which is expected to be funded over the next two to three years. Millenniums total investment balance in Valley Ventures at December 31, 2006 was $4 million. K 14 Table of Contents Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Sabinas) is a Mexican limited liability company created to develop up to 800 MW of coal fired generation in the Sabinas region of Coahuila, Mexico. Sabinas also owns 19.5% of Minerales de Monclova, S.A. de C.V. (Mimosa). Mimosa is an owner of coal and associated gas reserves and a supplier of metallurgical coal to the Mexican steel industry and thermal coal to the major electric utility in Mexico. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (AHMSA) and affiliates own the remaining 50%. UniSource Energys Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors of AHMSA. Since 1999, both AHMSA and Mimosa are parties to a suspension of payments procedure, under applicable Mexican law, which is the equivalent of a U.S. Chapter 11 proceeding. Under certain circumstances, Millennium has the right to sell (a put option) its interest in Sabinas to an AHMSA affiliate for $20 million plus any accrued service fee. Millenniums remaining investment balance in Sabinas at December 31, 2006 was $14 million. Discontinued Operations Global Solar Energy On March 31, 2006, Millennium completed the sale of its interest in Global Solar. The operating results of Global Solar are reported as discontinued operations. EMPLOYEES (As of December 31, 2006) TEP had 1,260 employees, of which approximately 54% are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local No. 1116.

UniSource Energys code of ethics, and any amendments made to the code of ethics, is also available on UniSource Energys website. Information contained at UniSource Energys website is not part of any report filed with the SEC by UniSource Energy or TEP. K 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The business and financial results of UniSource Energy and TEP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and in other documents we file with the SEC. Regulatory and other restrictions limit the ability of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to make distributions to UniSource Energy. UniSource Energy is a holding company that is dependent on the earnings and distributions of funds from its subsidiaries to service its debt and pay dividends to shareholders. Restrictions include: TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are restricted from lending or transferring funds or issuing securities without ACC approval; The Federal Power Act restricts electric utilities ability to pay dividends out of funds that are properly included in their capital account. TEP has an accumulated deficit rather than positive retained earnings. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe there is a reasonable basis for TEP to pay dividends from current year earnings. However, the FERC could attempt to stop TEP from paying further dividends or could seek to impose additional restrictions on the payment of dividends; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric must be in compliance with their respective debt agreements to make dividend payments to UniSource Energy. UniSource Energy does not expect to receive distributions from UNS Gas or UNS Electric before 2008 due to the need to apply internally generated funds to the growth of these businesses. TEPs retail rates are capped through 2008, which could negatively impact TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEPs current retail rates were established under a Settlement Agreement approved by the ACC in 1999. Under the Settlement Agreement, TEPs rates are capped until December 31, 2008. Operational failures or unscheduled outages at TEPs generating stations, especially during peak seasons, could result in unanticipated power purchases which could significantly increase the cost of serving TEPs retail load. Operational failures or damage to TEPs facilities, from storms or other events, could result in increased operating and capital expenses. In the event that any power purchase, natural gas or coal costs, operation and maintenance or other expenses increase, TEP could be adversely affected unless it were able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs with other cost reductions or increases in income and cash flow or otherwise seek rate recovery of such increased costs under emergency provisions of the Settlement Agreement. TEP may not be able to recover such costs. Uncertainty exists as to what methodology the ACC will use to set TEPs retail rates after December 31, 2008, which could negatively impact TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. There is disagreement between the participants in TEPs regulatory proceedings about what is to happen to the rates TEP charges for generation service after December 31, 2008. TEP believes the Settlement Agreement requires it to charge market based generation service rates while other participants, including ACC staff, disagree. The Settlement Agreement also requires TEP to record and amortize a $450 million transition recovery asset (TRA) and collect the balance from customers though a Fixed Competition Transition Charge (Fixed CTC). Based on current projections of retail sales, the TRA is expected to be fully amortized by mid 2008. The Fixed CTC currently produces revenues of slightly less than one cent per kWh sold, or approximately $90 million annually. If TEP is required to reduce its retail rates by the amount of the Fixed CTC, and is not allowed to charge market rates for its generation services or to adjust other rate components to reflect a higher cost of service, TEPs retail revenues will decrease approximately 12% relative to 2006 revenues from current retail rates. K 16 Table of Contents Restrictions on rate increases and the ability to recover fuel costs at UNS Gas could negatively impact its liquidity, cash flows and net income. UNS Gas filed a general rate case in July 2006. Under the terms of an ACC order, any resulting rate increase may not become effective until August 1, 2007. UNS Gas is subject to operational risks, including operational failures or damage to facilities which could result in unplanned operation, maintenance and capital expenditures. UNS Gas could be adversely affected unless it was able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs. UNS Gas has an automatic gas price adjustment mechanism, known as the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA), through which increases or decreases in the cost of gas can be passed on to customers. The PGA is subject to a cap on how much the factor can change in a 12 month period and anything above the cap must be approved by the ACC. In 2006, the cost of gas represented more than 77% of UNS Gas total operating costs. Natural gas prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and expose UNS Gas to commodity price risks to the extent they cannot be collected from customers in a timely manner. If UNS Gas is unable to recover its fuel costs or other costs of providing service in a timely manner, its liquidity could be adversely affected and it may be more difficult for UNS Gas to satisfy its obligations, including purchasing and paying for gas. In addition, it may be more difficult for UNS Gas to comply with the obligations and restrictive covenants of its debt agreements, which limit its ability to borrow money, and could result in an event of default. Restrictions on rate increases and the ability to recover purchased power and fuel costs at UNS Electric could negatively impact its liquidity, cash flows and net income. UNS Electric filed a general rate case in December 2006. Under the terms of an ACC order, any resulting rate increase may not become effective until August 1, 2007. Operational failures or damage to UNS Electrics facilities from storms or other events could result in increased operating and capital expenditures. UNS Electric could be adversely affected unless it was able to find ways of offsetting these increased costs. The expiration of UNS Electrics power supply agreement will require UNS Electric to find alternate sources for its energy needs, which may not be recovered through rates. UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement for 100% of its customers energy needs that expires May 2008. UNS Electric pays a fixed price per MWh for the power it purchases under the agreement. In 2006, UNS Electric sold approximately 1.6 million MWh to its retail customers. In 2008, UNS Electric will need a replacement source of energy for its customer base, which grew at 4% in 2006. UNS Electric has a purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) through which increases or decreases in the cost of power and fuel can be passed on to customers. The cost of UNS Electrics existing power supply agreement is being fully recovered through the PPFAC. The ACC must approve any change to the PPFAC. UNS Electric may be required to post margin under its power supply agreements which could negatively impact its liquidity. UNS Electric is in the process of evaluating and securing power supply resourced to replace the full requirements power supply agreement which expires in May 2008. The agreements under which UNS Electric contracts for such resources include requirements to post credit enhancement in the form of cash or letters of credit under certain circumstances, including changes in market prices which affect contract values, or a change in the creditworthiness of UNS Electric. In order to post such credit enhancement, UNS Electric would have to use available cash, draw under its revolving credit agreement, or issue letters of credit under its revolving credit agreement. As of February 23, 2007, the maximum amount that UNS Electric may use under its revolving credit facility is $30 million (to be increased to $45 million upon approval of a matter pending before the ACC). K 17 Table of Contents TEPs, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics revenues, results of operations and cash flows are seasonal, and are subject to weather conditions, economic conditions and customer usage patterns, which are beyond the Companys control. TEP typically earns the majority of its operating revenue and net income in the third quarter because of higher air conditioning usage by its retail customers due to hot summer weather. Furthermore, TEP typically reports limited net income in the first quarter because of relatively mild winter weather in its retail service territory. UNS Gas peak sales occur in the winter; UNS Electrics peak sales occur in the summer. Cool summers or warm winters may adversely affect the utility subsidiaries operating revenues and net income by reducing sales. Changes in federal energy regulation may affect TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are subject to comprehensive and changing governmental regulation at the federal level that continues to change the structure of the electric and gas utility industries and the ways in which these industries are regulated. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC has jurisdiction over rates for electric transmission in interstate commerce and rates for wholesale sales of electric power, including terms and prices of transmission services and sales of electricity at wholesale prices. Deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may result in increased competition resulting in an erosion of TEP and UNS Electrics retail customer base and a reduction in TEPs wholesale revenues. In 1999, the ACC approved rules providing a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona. As a result of the energy crisis in California in 2000 and 2001 and the volatility of natural gas prices, the competitive retail market in Arizona that was anticipated in 1999 did not materialize. In addition, a 2005 Arizona Court of Appeals ruling held certain portions of the ACCs retail competition rules invalid. Currently, none of TEP or UNS Electrics customers are receiving energy from other providers; however we cannot predict if retail competition will enter the Arizona market. Competition in wholesale markets has greatly escalated due to increased participation by utilities, non utility generators, independent power producers and other wholesale power marketers and brokers. Since 2001, electric generating capacity in Arizona has increased 61% to 25,600 MW, of which approximately 9,700 MW is from gas fired generators. Increased competition combined with increased supply and fewer creditworthy counterparties could reduce the prices at which TEP sells electricity in the wholesale market. In 2006, TEPs wholesale revenues were $188 million or 19% of TEPs total revenues. UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and results of operations. UniSource Energy has no operations of its own and derives all of its revenues and cash flow from its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, total debt (including capital lease obligations) to total capitalization for UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries was 72%. The substantial amount of indebtedness of UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries could: require UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to pay principal and interest on its debt, which could reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; make UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries more vulnerable to restrictions imposed by new governmental regulations as well as changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of its business strategy or other purposes; limit the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to UniSource Energy; and make it more difficult for UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries to comply with the obligations of its debt instruments, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements. K 18 Table of Contents The terms of UniSource Energys and its subsidiaries existing debt instruments and future debt instruments may restrict UniSource Energys current and future operations, particularly the ability to respond to changes in its business or to take certain actions. The UniSource Energy Credit Agreement, the TEP Credit Agreement and other existing debt instruments contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on UniSource Energy, including restrictions on the ability to engage in acts that may be in UniSource Energys best long term interests. The TEP Credit Agreement includes financial covenants, including requirements to maintain certain minimum cash coverage ratios and not to exceed certain maximum total leverage ratios. The UniSource Credit Agreement contains similar financial covenants. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in UniSource Energys and its subsidiaries existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect UniSource Energys ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The cost of renewing or purchasing TEPs leased assets, or the cost of procuring alternate sources of generation or purchased power, could adversely affect TEPs results of operations, net income and cash flows. TEP, under separate sale and leaseback arrangements, leases the following generation facilities: Springerville Unit 1; Sundt Unit 4; Springerville Coal Handling Facilities; and Springerville Common Facilities. . TEP may renew the leases or purchase the assets when the leases expire at various times between 2011 and 2021. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, whereas fixed purchase price options exist for the coal handling and common facilities leases. Upon expiration of the coal handling and common facilities leases (whether at the end of the initial term or any renewal term), TEP has the obligation under agreements with the Springerville Units 3 and 4 owners to purchase such facilities, and the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 14% and 17% interest, respectively, in these facilities. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations which may increase their cost of operations or expose them to environmentally related litigation and liabilities. UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental regulations affecting present and future operations, including regulations regarding air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. Many of these regulations arise from TEPs use of coal as the primary fuel for energy generation. Existing environmental regulations may be revised or new regulations may be adopted or become applicable to UniSource Energys utility subsidiaries. Compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. The U.S. Congress is considering the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. At this time, we do not know whether any such regulations will be adopted, the scope of such regulations or how any such regulations could affect our operations. TEP is also contractually obligated to pay a portion of its environmental reclamation costs at generating stations in which it has a minority interest and possibly at the mines that supply these generating stations. While TEP has recorded the portion of its costs that can be determined at this time, the total costs for final reclamation at these sites are unknown and could be substantial. TEP may be required to redeem significant amounts of its outstanding tax exempt bonds. TEP has financed a portion of its utility plant assets with tax exempt bonds for which the exemption from income taxes requires that the financed facilities be used for the local furnishing of electric energy. Approximately $359 million of these bonds were outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Various events, including, in certain K 19 Table of Contents circumstances, the formation of an RTO or an independent system operator, asset divestitures, changes in tax laws or changes in system operations, could require TEP to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds which would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater principal amount. TEP may not be permitted to construct a Tucson to Nogales transmission line and TEP or UNS Electric may be required to find alternate ways to improve reliability in UNS Electrics Santa Cruz service area. In 2001, TEP entered into an agreement to build an approximately 60 mile transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona, in response to an order from the ACC to improve reliability to UNS Electrics retail customers in Nogales. Required regulatory approvals have delayed the construction of the transmission line, and in 2005, the ACC initiated proceedings to review the status of service in Nogales and need for the 345 kV line. If TEP does not receive required approvals or if we abandon the project, it may be required to expense a portion of the $11 million it has incurred through December 31, 2006, in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses. In such an event, TEP or UNS Electric may be required to make additional expenditures to improve reliability. In the event TEP or UNS Electric are not able to recover such expenditures, their results of operations and net income could be adversely affected. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES TEP PROPERTIES TEPs transmission facilities, located in Arizona and New Mexico, transmit electricity from TEPs remote electric generating stations at Four Corners, Navajo, San Juan, Springerville and Luna to the Tucson area for use by TEPs retail customers (see Item 1. Business Generating and Other Resources). The transmission system is interconnected at various points in Arizona and New Mexico with a number of regional utilities. TEP has arrangements with approximately 120 companies to interchange generation capacity and transmission of energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP owned or participated in an overhead electric transmission and distribution system consisting of: 512 circuit miles of 500 kV lines; 1,098 circuit miles of 345 kV lines; 365 circuit miles of 138 kV lines; 437 circuit miles of 46 kV lines; and 2,631 circuit miles of lower voltage primary lines. The underground electric distribution system is comprised of 4,201 cable miles. TEP owns approximately 60% of the poles on which the lower voltage lines are located. Electric substation capacity consisted of 101 substations with a total installed transformer capacity of 6,738,947 kilovolt amperes. Substantially all of the utility assets owned by TEP are subject to the lien of the 1992 Mortgage. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos Resources Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of TEP (San Carlos), is not subject to the lien. The electric generating stations (except as noted below), operating headquarters, warehouse and service center are located on land owned by TEP. The electric distribution and transmission facilities owned by TEP are located: on property owned by TEP; under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state lands under franchises, easements or other rights which are generally subject to termination; under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the record holder of title; or over American Indian reservations under grant of easement by the Secretary of Interior or lease by American Indian tribes. It is possible that some of the easements, and the property over which the easements were granted, may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired. K 20 Table of Contents Springerville is located on land parcels held by TEP under a long term surface ownership agreement with the State of Arizona. Four Corners and Navajo are located on properties held under easements from the United States and under leases from the Navajo Nation, respectively. TEP, individually and in conjunction with PNM in connection with San Juan, has acquired easements and leases for transmission lines and a water diversion facility located on land owned by the Navajo Nation. TEP has also acquired easements for transmission facilities, related to San Juan, Four Corners, and Navajo, across the Zuni, Navajo and Tohono Oodham Indian Reservations. TEP, in conjunction with PNM and Phelps Dodge, holds an undivided ownership interest in the property on which Luna is located. TEPs rights under these various easements and leases may be subject to defects such as: possible conflicting grants or encumbrances due to the absence of or inadequacies in the recording laws or record systems of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the American Indian tribes; possible inability of TEP to legally enforce its rights against adverse claimants and the American Indian tribes without Congressional consent; or failure or inability of the American Indian tribes to protect TEPs interests in the easements and leases from disruption by the U.S. Congress, Secretary of the Interior, or other adverse claimants. These possible defects have not interfered and are not expected to materially interfere with TEPs interest in and operation of its facilities. TEP, under separate sale and leaseback arrangements, leases the following generation facilities (which do not include land): coal handling facilities at Springerville; a 50% undivided interest in the Springerville Common Facilities; Springerville Unit 1 and the remaining 50% undivided interest in the Springerville Common Facilities; and Sundt Unit 4 and related common facilities.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Contractual Obligations, for additional information on TEPs capital lease obligations. UES PROPERTIES UNS Gas As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas transmission and distribution system consisted of approximately 78 miles of steel transmission mains, 4,223 miles of steel and plastic distribution mains, and 148,432 customer service lines. UNS Electric As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electrics transmission and distribution system consisted of approximately 56 circuit miles of 115 kV transmission lines, 236 circuit miles of 69 kV transmission lines, and 3,432 circuit miles of underground and overhead distribution lines. UNS Electric also owns 39 substations having a total installed capacity of 1,641,250 kilovolt amperes and the 65 MW Valencia plant. The gas and electric distribution and transmission facilities owned by UNS Gas and UNS Electric are located: on property owned by UNS Gas or UNS Electric; under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state lands under franchises, easements or other rights which are generally subject to termination; or under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the record holder of title. It is possible that some of the easements, and the property over which the easements were granted, may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired. K 21 Table of Contents ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Operations, for litigation related to ACC orders and retail competition. We discuss other legal proceedings in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. City of Tacoma In June 2004, the City of Tacoma, Washington filed a lawsuit (City of Tacoma v. American Electric Power Services Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Ct. W.D. Wash.)) against TEP and various other electricity generators and marketers alleging that the defendants violated antitrust laws by colluding to affect the price of electricity in the Pacific Northwest from May 2000 through 2001. In September 2004, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. TEP, along with other defendants, filed a joint motion to dismiss, which was granted on February 11, 2005. The City of Tacoma appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit and the appeal is now pending. TEP believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest them. ITEM 4.

NON GAAP MEASURES Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change which is a non cash item. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is presented here as a measure of liquidity because it can be used as an indication of a companys ability to incur and service debt and is commonly used as an analytical indicator in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and we do not intend Adjusted EBITDA to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered to be an alternative to cash flows from operations or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP or an indicator of our operating performance. UniSource Energy and TEP believe Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors as a measure of liquidity.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis explains the results of operations, the general financial condition, and the outlook for UniSource Energy and its three primary business segments and includes the following: outlook and strategies, operating results during 2006 compared with 2005, and 2005 compared with 2004, factors which affect our results and outlook, liquidity, capital needs, capital resources, and contractual obligations, dividends, and critical accounting estimates. UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns the outstanding common stock of TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. (UES), Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. (Millennium), and UniSource Energy Development Company (UED). TEP, an electric utility, has provided electric service to the community of Tucson, Arizona, for over 100 years. UES was established in 2003, when it acquired the Arizona gas and electric properties from Citizens. UES, through its two operating subsidiaries, UNS Gas, Inc. (UNS Gas) and UNS Electric, Inc. (UNS Electric), provides gas and electric service to 30 communities in Northern and Southern Arizona. Millennium has existing investments in unregulated businesses; however no new investments are planned at Millennium. UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS), a gas turbine project in Northern Arizona that, subject to approval, is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. We conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold its interest in Global Solar Energy, Inc. (Global Solar), its largest holding. At December 31, 2006, the investment in Millennium represented 3% of UniSource Energys Total Assets. UNISOURCE ENERGY CONSOLIDATED OUTLOOK AND STRATEGIES Our financial prospects and outlook for the next few years will be affected by many competitive, regulatory and economic factors. Our plans and strategies include the following: Efficiently manage our generation, transmission and distribution resources and seek ways to control our operating expenses while maintaining and enhancing reliability and profitability; Expand TEPs portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand and respond to wholesale market opportunities; Expand UNS Electrics portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand upon the expiration of the full requirements contract with PWMT; Resolve the uncertainty surrounding TEPs rates for generation service after 2008, while preserving TEPs benefits under the Settlement Agreement; Receive ACC approval of rate increases for UNS Gas and UNS Electric to provide adequate revenues to cover the rising cost of providing service to their customers; Enhance the value of existing generation assets by working with Salt River Project to support the construction of Springerville Unit 4; Enhance the value of TEPs transmission system while continuing to provide reliable access to generation for TEP and UNS Electrics retail customers and market access for all generating assets; K 29 Table of Contents Continue to develop synergies between UNS Gas,UNS Electric and TEP; Improve capital structure; and Promote economic development in our service territories. To accomplish our goals, during 2007 we expect to spend the following on capital expenditures: Segment Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 UNS Gas 38 UNS Electric 43 Other (1) 27 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 (1) Represents capital expenditures by UED related to the 90 MW BMGS to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, in UNS Electrics service area. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. While we believe that our plans and strategies will continue to have a positive impact on our financial prospects and position, we recognize that we continue to be highly leveraged, and as a result, our access to the capital markets may be limited or more expensive than for less leveraged companies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview UniSource Energy recorded Income Before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change of $69 million in 2006, $52 million in 2005 and $51 million in 2004. Net Income of $67 million in 2006 includes a $2 million loss from discontinued operations; net income of $46 million in 2005 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations and a $1 million loss from the cumulative effect of an accounting change; and net income of $46 million in 2004 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations. 2006 Compared With 2005 The improvement in UniSource Energys results in 2006 is due primarily to: the higher availability of TEPs coal fired generating plants; the start of commercial operations at Luna in April 2006; retail customer growth at TEP; interest savings related to various financing activities in 2005 and 2006; and the commencement of commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in August 2006. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below, and Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, below. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold Global Solar for $16 million in cash and an option to purchase, under certain conditions, 5% to 10% of Global Solar in the future. In 2006, UniSource Energy recorded an after tax loss of approximately $2 million related to the discontinued operations and disposal of Global Solar. See Other Non Reportable Segments, Results of Operations, Discontinued Operations Global Solar, below. 2005 Compared With 2004 UniSource Energys results in 2005 were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned outages at several of TEPs coal plants. One of TEPs largest coal plants suffered a nearly month long outage in August 2005, during a period when customer demand was high and energy prices were boosted by the impact of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher natural gas prices and the cost of purchasing replacement power during the outage contributed to an 82% increase in TEPs purchased power expense. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below. Also in 2005, UniSource Energy completed a financial restructuring, issuing $240 million of debt and using the proceeds to repay an inter company note and infuse capital into its subsidiaries. TEP retired approximately $321 million of debt and capital lease obligations (net of proceeds received from TEPs investment in lease debt).

Generally, cash from operations is lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. We use our available cash primarily to: fund capital expenditures at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric; pay dividends to shareholders; and reduce leverage. The primary source of liquidity for UniSource Energy, the parent company, is dividends it receives from its subsidiaries, primarily TEP. Also, under our tax sharing agreement, our subsidiaries make income tax payments to UniSource Energy, which makes payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The table below provides a summary of the liquidity position of UniSource Energy on a stand alone basis and each of its segments.

The matter is pending before the ACC. (2) Includes cash and cash equivalents at Millennium. Executive Overview Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities were $283 million or $9 million higher than 2005. The increase is due primarily to: an increase in TEPs cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs; higher UNS Gas retail revenues; and the wind down of activity at MEG; partially offset by a $32 million payment made to the IRS and state tax authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $76 million higher in 2006 primarily due to: TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease; growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; utility system growth at UNS Gas and UNS Electric; the purchase of two gas turbines by UED; and TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna. Forecasted Capital Expenditures Business Segment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 293 UNS Gas 38 33 27 28 26 UNS Electric 43 39 42 28 34 Other 27 10 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 $ 320 $ 264 $ 280 $ 353 Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $331 million, or 39% higher than forecasted amounts reported in 2006. This increase is the result of several factors including: higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; generation needs for UNS Electric; and continued strong customer growth in UniSource Energys utility service territories. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities were $36 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors impacting cash used for financing activities in 2006 include: an increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings and lower debt issuance costs; partially offset by an increase in net repayments of long term debt; higher payments on capital lease obligations by TEP; higher dividends paid by UniSource Energy to its shareholders. In 2005, UniSource Energy issued $240 million of debt, which it used to repay an inter company note to TEP and infuse K 32 Table of Contents capital into its subsidiaries. TEP used the proceeds from the inter company note repayment and capital infusion to retire $282 million of debt. As a result of the activities described above, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased to $104 million at December 31, 2006, from $145 million at December 31, 2005. We invest cash balances in high grade money market securities with an emphasis on preserving the principal amounts invested. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures at UniSource Energys subsidiaries, the revolving credit facilities at UniSource Energy, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may be used on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements of the strong utility customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt, as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy to its subsidiaries. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of rate related proceedings at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. For more information concerning liquidity and capital resources, see Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Other Non Reportable Segments, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. Convertible Senior Notes In March 2005, UniSource Energy issued $150 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, which are unsecured and are not guaranteed by TEP or any other UniSource Energy subsidiary. Each $1,000 of Convertible Senior Notes is convertible into 26.6667 shares of our Common Stock at any time, representing a conversion price of approximately $37.50 per share of our Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Beginning in March 2010, UniSource Energy will have the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, for cash, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the notes will have the right to require UniSource Energy to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, for cash on March 1, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or if certain specified fundamental changes involving UniSource Energy occur. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a fundamental change that occurs prior to March 2010, UniSource Energy may be required to pay a make whole premium on notes converted in connection with the fundamental change. The make whole premium will be payable in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock or the consideration into which UniSource Energy Common Stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with such fundamental change. A fundamental change involving UniSource Energy will be deemed to have occurred if: (1) certain transactions occur as a result of which there is a change in control of UniSource Energy; or (2) UniSource Energy Common Stock ceases to be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq National Market or another established automated over the counter trading market in the United States. The notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes. The failure to make required payments on the notes or comply with the terms of the indenture may constitute an event of default. In addition, events of default may arise upon the acceleration of $50 million of indebtedness for borrowed money of UniSource Energy or TEP, or certain events of bankruptcy involving UniSource Energy or TEP. UniSource Energy Credit Agreement In August 2006, UniSource Energy amended and restated its existing credit agreement (UniSource Credit Agreement). The amendment extended the maturity from April 2010 to August 2011, reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings, and changed the amounts available under the term loan and the revolving credit facilities. As amended, the UniSource Credit Agreement consists of a $30 million term loan facility and a $70 million revolving credit facility. Prior to the amendment, the UniSource Credit Agreement included a $90 million term loan facility ($84 million outstanding) and a $15 million revolving credit facility (zero outstanding). On August 11, 2006, UniSource Energy repaid the $84 million outstanding term loan with $30 million of available cash, $30 million drawn under the new term loan and $24 million drawn under the revolving credit facility. K 33 Table of Contents Quarterly principal payments of $1.5 million on the outstanding term loan are due beginning in September 2006, with the balance due at maturity. At December 31, 2006, there was $27 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $20 million outstanding under the UniSource Energy revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 6.67%. In January 2007, UniSource Energy repaid the $20 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. We have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 1.25% or the sum of the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate and 0.25%. The UniSource Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of assets, and certain investments and acquisitions. We must also meet: (1) a minimum cash flow to debt service coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a standalone basis and (2) a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. We may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, we have more than $15 million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving credit. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the terms of the UniSource Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the UniSource Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UniSource Credit Agreement, failure of UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million, or certain bankruptcy events at UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries. Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. We entered into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness of a subsidiary on a stand alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees at December 31, 2006 were: UES guarantee of $160 million of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas and UNS Electric to purchase the Citizens Arizona gas and electric system assets; UES guarantee of a $40 million revolving credit facility available to UNS Gas and UNS Electric; and UniSource Energys guarantee of approximately $5 million in natural gas and supply payments and building lease payments for UNS Gas and UNS Electric. To the extent liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have indemnified the purchasers of interests in certain investments from additional taxes due for years prior to the sale. The terms of the indemnifications provide for no limitation on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided by all tax laws and paid all tax obligations. We have not made any payments under the terms of these indemnifications to date. We believe that the likelihood that UniSource Energy would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. K 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following charts display UniSource Energys consolidated contractual obligations by maturity and by type of obligation as of December 31, 2006.

TEPs Variable Rate IDBs are backed by LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August 2011. Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022, the above maturity reflects a redemption or repurchase of such bonds in 2011 as though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit Agreement. (2) Includes letter of credit and remarketing fees on variable rate debt. The interest rates for variable rate debt are estimated using Eurodollar futures rates for an approximation of LIBOR. For variable rate IDBs, a discount is applied to estimated LIBOR based on the historical discount the IDBs have had to LIBOR. (3) Beginning with commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in September 2006, Tri State is reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the common facilities on an ongoing basis, including 14% of the Springerville Common Lease payments and 17% of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments. Similar reimbursement obligations are required after Unit 4 is constructed. TEP remains the obligor under these capital leases. Capital Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction associated with this reimbursement. (4) Annual payments under the Springerville Unit 1 lease vary in accordance with the amortization schedules of the debt underlying the capital lease, with significantly larger principal payments occurring in 2007, 2008 and 2011. (5) Purchase obligations reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. The total amount paid under these contracts depends on the quantity purchased and transported. TEP and UES requirements are expected to be in excess of K 35 Table of Contents these minimums. UniSource Energy has excluded open purchase orders of approximately $13 million expected to be fulfilled in 2007. (6) Based on prior years expenditures, TEP expects to spend approximately $200 million annually for the purchase and transportation of coal through 2010. TEP is unable to estimate how much it will spend under these contracts beyond 2010 due to the impact of the amended Springerville coal contract. (7) Includes TEP and UNS Electrics forward power purchases. TEP has not included capacity payments under TEPs purchased power agreement with Tri State which may be reduced in increments of 25 MW with 90 days notice. To date, TEP has received no such notice. If Tri State does not give notice to reduce capacity, the minimum capacity payments will be $31 million annually in 2007 through 2010 and $21 million in 2011. UniSource Energy also has not included amounts payable to PWMT under UNS Electrics full requirements power supply agreement as payments under this contract are usage based with no fixed demand charges and are recovered through the purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) mechanism. We expect to spend approximately $100 million annually under this contract through May 2008. (8) Amounts include UNS Gas fixed price forward gas purchases and firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern. Incremental gas purchases are excluded as prices and volumes vary. Amounts also exclude swap agreements which are marked to market on a monthly basis and do not include any minimum payment obligation. UNS Gas entered into forward gas purchases for 2007 through 2010 totaling $9 million subsequent to December 31, 2006, which are excluded from the table above. (9) Excludes TEPs liability for final environmental reclamation at the coal mines which supply the remote generating stations. TEP estimates its undiscounted final reclamation liability is $41 million with reclamation beginning in 2028. See Note 6. Also excludes asset retirement obligations expected to occur through 2066. See Note 3. Also, excludes Millenniums equity commitments totaling $1 million over two years to fund subsidiaries (Valley Ventures) as suitable investments are identified. (10) These obligations represent TEP and UES minimum required contributions to pension plans in 2007 and TEPs expected postretirement benefit costs to cover medical and life insurance claims as determined by the plans actuaries. TEP and UES do not know and have not included pension contributions beyond 2007 due to the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts. TEP funds the postretirement benefit plan on a pay as you go basis. (11) These obligations represent TEPs share of the cost of new pollution control equipment based on its ownership of San Juan. Under a settlement agreement signed in March 2005 with the New Mexico Environmental Department and environmental activist groups, the co owners of San Juan will install new technology at the generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx, and SO2 emissions. In addition, TEPs share of increased operating and maintenance costs associated with the new technologies is expected to be approximately $12 million over the next 10 years. (12) TEP has agreed with the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP is obligated to acquire the facilities at fixed prices of $120 million in 2015, $38 million in 2017, and $68 million in 2021. Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 17% and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: We do not have any provisions in any of our debt or lease agreements that would cause an event of default or cause amounts to become due and payable in the event of a credit rating downgrade. None of our contracts or financing structures contains provisions or acceleration clauses due to changes in our stock price. Dividends on Common Stock On February 9, 2007, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.225 per share on its Common Stock. The first quarter dividend, totaling approximately $8 million, will be paid March 14, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. During 2006, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.21 per share, totaling approximately $29 million. In 2005, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.19 per share, totaling approximately $26 million. Income Tax Position At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal and state income tax filing purposes, the following carryforward amounts: UniSource Energy TEP Amount Expiring Amount Expiring Millions of Dollars Year Millions of Dollars Year Capital Loss $ 37 2010 2011 $ AMT Credit 48 34 K 36 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Service Matters On its 2002 tax return, TEP filed for an automatic change in accounting method relating to the capitalization of indirect costs to the production of electricity and self constructed assets. The new accounting method was also used on the 2003 and 2004 returns for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. In August 2005, the IRS issued a ruling which draws into question the ability of electric and gas utilities to use the new accounting method. As a result, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have filed amended returns for 2002, 2003 and 2004 to remove the benefit previously claimed using the accounting method. In 2006, TEP and UNS Electric remitted tax and interest of $23 million and $1 million respectively to the IRS; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric remitted $8 million to state authorities. In December 2006, the IRS issued a final notice to the company disallowing the use of the accounting method. We are in the process of filing a protest and will proceed to appeals. TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial condition and results of operations of TEP are currently the principal factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of UniSource Energy on an annual basis. The following discussion relates to TEPs utility operations, unless otherwise noted. 2006 Compared With 2005 TEP recorded net income of $67 million in 2006 compared with $48 million in 2005. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2006 included: a $53 million increase in total operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather during the second quarter and retail customer growth; a $9 million increase in wholesale revenues due primarily to $3 million of transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in unrealized gains related to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Margins on wholesale sales were lower than last year due to a decline in the average market price for power; a $23 million increase in other revenues due primarily to fees and reimbursements received from Tri State for fuel and O&M costs related to Springerville Unit 3; a $24 million decrease in purchased power expense due to increased production at TEPs coal fired generating plants and the availability of Luna to offset some of the wholesale purchases to meet retail customer demand during peak summer periods. Purchased power expense also reflects a $4 million increase in unrealized losses due to mark to market adjustments on forward purchases of energy; offset by a $31 million increase in fuel expense due to increased generation at TEPs coal fired plants, gas related fuel expense at Luna and $8 million of fuel costs associated with Springerville Unit 3; a $31 million increase in O&M expense. TEPs O&M includes $9 million of expenses related to Springerville Unit 3. In addition, pre tax gains related to the sale of excess SO2 emission allowances were $7 million lower than 2005. Other factors contributing to higher O&M include operating expenses at Luna; generating plant maintenance; and higher payroll expenses; a $10 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and K 37 Table of Contents a $13 million decrease in total interest expense due primarily to lower interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations, which was partially offset by interest paid to the IRS related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and fees incurred in the third quarter of 2006 related to amending TEPs Credit Agreement. In 2006, the net pre tax benefit recognized by TEP related to Springerville Unit 3 for transmission revenues, operating fees and its share of the common costs was $8 million. 2005 Compared With 2004 TEP recorded income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $49 million in 2005 compared with $46 million in 2004. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2005 Included: a $26 million decrease in TEPs total operating revenue less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $60 million increase in TEPs purchased power expense resulting primarily from an extended unplanned outage of Springerville Unit 2 in August 2005, planned maintenance outages at San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 during the second quarter and higher wholesale power prices; a $14 million increase in TEPs fuel expense due to a $3 million increase in natural gas costs primarily from higher gas prices and an $11 million increase in coal costs; a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather and a 3% increase in TEPs customer base; and a $19 million increase in TEPs wholesale revenues due to higher market prices for power compared to last year. a $22 million decrease in O&M. Higher maintenance costs at TEPs coal fired plants were offset by an increase of $10 million in pre tax gains on the sale of excess SO2 Emission Allowances by TEP; a $6 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and a $17 million decrease in total interest expense related to the financial restructuring of TEP in May 2005. 2004 Included: expenses of $8 million related to a proposed but terminated acquisition of UniSource Energy. Utility Sales and Revenues Customer growth, weather and other consumption factors affect retail sales of electricity. Electric wholesale revenues are affected by market prices in the wholesale energy market, the availability of TEP generating resources, and the level of wholesale forward contract activity. K 38 Table of Contents The table below provides trend information on retail sales by major customer class and electric wholesale sales made by TEP in the last three years as well as weather data for TEPs service territory.

Wholesale revenues increased $9 million in 2006 compared with last year. In 2006, wholesale revenues included $3 million in transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in net unrealized gain due to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Wholesale kWh sales increased 8% primarily due to the higher availability of TEPs coal plants; however, margins on wholesale sales were lower due to a 16% decrease in the average market price of wholesale energy. TEPs margins on wholesale sales were higher in 2005, as hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico boosted market prices for wholesale energy in the last six months of the year.

Despite lower coal plant availability and a 3% decrease in wholesale kWh sales, wholesale revenues increased $18 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared with 2004. The average wholesale market price of energy was $59 per MWh in 2005, compared with $44 per MWh in 2004. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Operating Expenses 2006 Compared with 2005 Fuel and Purchased Power TEPs fuel and purchased power expense, and energy resources for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are detailed below: Generation Expense 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of kWh Millions of Dollars Coal Fired Generation Four Corners 812 783 749 $ 12 $ 11 $ 10 Navajo 1,215 1,221 1,244 17 16 15 San Juan 2,486 2,484 2,435 56 53 48 Springerville 5,826 5,572 5,731 96 94 92 Sundt 4 623 787 735 14 16 14 Total Coal Fired Generation 10,962 10,847 10,894 $ 195 $ 190 $ 179 Gas Fired Generation Luna 516 24 Other Units 334 368 432 31 36 34 Total Gas Fired Generation 850 368 432 55 36 34 Solar and Other Generation 9 9 8 Total Generation (1) 11,821 11,224 11,334 250 226 213 Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 103 131 73 Net Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Forward Purchases of Energy 6 2 Total Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 109 133 73 Total Resources 13,528 12,863 12,656 $ 359 $ 359 $ 286 Less Line Losses and Company Use 886 806 821 Total Energy Sold 12,642 12,057 11,835 (1) Fuel expense in 2006 excludes $8 million related to Springerville Unit 3; the fuel costs incurred on behalf of Unit 3 are recorded in Fuel Expense and the reimbursement by Tri State is recorded in Other Revenue. The start of commercial operation of Luna and higher coal plant availability in the summer months led to a $24 million increase in fuel expense in 2006 (excluding fuel expenses at Springerville Unit 3); however, purchased power expense decreased $24 million as these same factors reduced TEPs need to purchase power during the summer months to meet retail demand. Gas fired generation more than doubled in 2006, causing gas related fuel expense to increase $19 million, or 53%. Coal fired generation increased 1%, leading to a $5 million increase in coal related fuel expense. Lunas generation output reported in the table above includes energy generated during its test phase, but does not include any associated fuel costs which were capitalized and reported as project costs. Despite a 4% increase in purchased energy volumes, purchased power expense was $24 million, or 18%, lower due to a decrease in average wholesale energy prices in 2006 as well as fewer short term purchases during the summer months when market prices for wholesale energy are typically higher. In September 2006, TEP began purchasing energy from Tri State under a 100 MW purchased power agreement. The table below shows TEPs average resource cost per kWh generated: K 40 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 cents per kWh Coal 1.78 1.75 1.64 Gas 6.69 9.78 7.87 All sources 2.61 2.01 1.88 *In 2006, the average cost of gas generation per kWh excludes test energy produced at Luna and its associated fuel costs. TRA amortization increased $10 million in 2006. Amortization of the TRA is the result of the Settlement Agreement with the ACC, which changed the accounting method for TEPs generation operations. This item reflects the recovery, through 2008, of transition recovery assets which were previously regulatory assets of the generation business. The amount of amortization is a function of the TRA balance and total kWh consumption by TEPs distribution customers. The table below shows estimated annual TRA amortization and unamortized TRA year end balances for 2007 and 2008. Estimated Unamortized TRA Amortization TRA Balance Millions of Dollars 2007 76 26 2008 26 Other Income (Deductions) In 2005, TEPs Income Statement included inter company Interest Income of $2 million. This represented Interest Income on a promissory note TEP received from UniSource Energy in exchange for the transfer to UniSource Energy of its stock in Millennium in 1998. UniSource Energy repaid the inter company promissory note on March 1, 2005. On UniSource Energys Consolidated Statement of Income, this Interest Income, as well as UniSource Energys related interest expense, was eliminated as an inter company transaction. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, TEP Cash Flows, Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy, below. Operating Expenses 2005 Compared with 2004 Fuel and Purchased Power During 2005, planned outages at Springerville Unit 2, San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 and an extended unplanned outage at Springerville Unit 2 during the third quarter led to higher gas related fuel costs and an 82% increase in purchased power expense. Purchased power expense increased $60 million compared with 2004, due to a 19% increase in MWhs purchased and an increase in wholesale market prices for power. The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Palo Verde Index increased 34% in 2005 compared with average prices in 2004. A combination of higher coal and natural gas costs contributed to a $13 million increase in total fuel expense at TEPs generating plants in 2005. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change TEP adopted FIN 47 in December 2005 and recorded a one time $1 million after tax cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and Critical Accounting Estimates, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, below. K 41 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Competition In 2001, all of TEPs retail customers became eligible to choose an alternative energy service provider (ESP), however, only a small number of commercial and industrial customers initially chose an ESP. By 2002, none of TEPs retail customers were served by an alternative ESP. In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. In February 2006, the ACC Staff requested that a proceeding be opened to address the issue of retail electric competition. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules. TEP has met all conditions required by the ACC to facilitate electric retail competition, including ACC approval of TEPs direct access tariffs. See Rates, ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement, below. TEP competes against gas service suppliers and others that provide energy services. Other forms of energy technologies may provide competition to TEPs services in the future, but to date, are generally not financially viable alternatives for its retail customers. Self generation by TEPs large industrial customers could also provide competition for TEPs services in the future, but has not had a significant impact to date. In the wholesale market, TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy. ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement Beginning in May 2005, TEP filed a series of pleadings requesting the ACC to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the methodology that will be applied to determine TEPs rates for generation service after 2008. TEP filed the pleadings in response to the Arizona Court of Appeals ruling related to retail competition and market pricing and a lack of agreement as to the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement by a number of participants in TEPs rate proceedings. TEP believes that the Settlement Agreement contemplated market based rates for generation service after 2008. See Competition, above for information regarding the recent court ruling. In April 2006, the ACC ordered that a procedure be established to allow for an expeditious and complete review of, among other things, the Settlement Agreement and its effect on how TEPs rates for generation services will be determined after December 31, 2008. The testimony filed by a number of participants in this proceeding, including the ACC Staff and Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO), reflect differing interpretations of the Settlement Agreement and a belief that TEP is required to charge cost of service rates for generation service in 2009. According to testimony filed by TEP, its average retail rate would increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. TEP also proposed two alternatives to charging market based rates for generation in 2009: a market phase in proposal with an initial rate increase capped at 12%; and a cost of service (including an $850 million regulatory asset and energy cost adjustment clause) proposal that would increase average retail rates in 2009 approximately 26% over current rates. See TEP Testimony, The Market Phase in Proposal, and The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal, below for more information. In February 2007, parties in this proceeding participated in settlement discussions, however were unable to reach a settlement. A public hearing before an ACC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) is scheduled to begin on March 6, 2007. Following the public hearing, the ALJ will propose a recommended opinion and order for consideration by the ACC. We expect the ALJ to issue a recommendation in the second quarter of 2007. If the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement allowing TEP to charge market based rates for generation service in 2009 and orders TEP to return to cost of service generation rates without compensating TEP for financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, TEP will file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages. K 42 Table of Contents Rates Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Rules that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. The Rules and the Settlement Agreement established: a period from November 1999 through 2008 for TEP to transition its generation assets from a cost of service based rate structure to a market, or competitive, rate structure; the recovery through rates during the transition period of $450 million of stranded generation costs through a fixed competitive transition charge (Fixed CTC); capped rates for TEP retail customers through 2008; an ACC interim review of TEP retail rates in 2004; unbundling of electric services with separate rates or prices for generation, transmission, distribution, metering, meter reading, billing and collection, and ancillary services; a process for ESPs to become licensed by the ACC to sell generation services at market prices to TEP retail customers; access for TEP retail customers to buy market priced generation services from ESPs beginning in 2000 (currently, no TEP customers are purchasing generation services from ESPs); transmission and distribution services would remain subject to regulation on a cost of service basis; and beginning in 2009, TEPs generation would be market based and its retail customers would pay the market rate for generation services. Track A and Track B Proceedings During 2002 and 2003, the ACC reexamined circumstances that had changed since it approved the Rules in 1999. The outstanding issues were divided into two groups. Track A related primarily to the divestiture of generation assets while Track B related primarily to the competitive energy bidding process. Under the ACCs Rules, TEP and other utilities were required to divest their generation assets. TEP later requested a waiver of the divestiture requirement. The Track A order granted TEPs request and eliminated the divesture requirement. As a result, generation assets remain at TEP. At the same time, the ACC ordered the parties, including TEP, to develop a competitive bidding process and reduced the minimum amount of power to be acquired in the competitive bidding process to only that portion not supplied by TEPs existing resources. The ACC Track B order defined the competitive bidding process TEP must use to obtain capacity and energy requirements. The Track B order did not address TEPs purchased power or asset acquisitions occurring subsequent to the 2003 competitive solicitation. 2004 General Rate Case Information In June 2004, as required by the Settlement Agreement, TEP filed general rate case information with the ACC. TEPs filing did not propose any change in retail rates and, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no rate case filed by TEP through 2008 may result in a net rate increase. However, absent the restriction on raising rates, TEP believes that the data in its filing would have justified an increase in retail rates of 16%. The general rate case information used a historical test year ended December 31, 2003 and established, based on TEPs standard offer service, that TEP was experiencing a revenue deficiency of $111 million. None of the intervenor testimony filed proposed any decrease to TEPs rates. Testimony filed by the ACC Staff, Residential Utility Consumer Office and Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition indicated revenue deficiencies for TEP of $67 million, $32 million and $38 million, respectively. In 2005, the ALJ issued a procedural order suspending the remaining testimony filing deadlines and hearing in the 2004 rate review. K 43 Table of Contents TEP Testimony In August 2006, TEP filed testimony in the ACC proceedings to review the Settlement Agreement. TEPs testimony states its belief that it is entitled to charge market based generation service rates in 2009 and has complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. TEP testimony states that the Settlement Agreement provided the terms and conditions by which TEP is to transition into the competitive electric marketplace. The rate impact of charging market based generation service rates in 2009 would vary with market conditions which are influenced by the cost of natural gas. Assuming a natural gas cost of $7 per MMBtu, which equates to a wholesale power price of approximately $60 per MWh, TEPs average retail rate would be expected to increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. The Settlement Agreement required TEP to significantly change the way it conducted business. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, TEP agreed to: (i) rate reductions in 1999 and 2000; (ii) a rate freeze from July 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008, taking all the risk of inflation and cost increases; (iii) unbundled tariffed rates; (iv) accelerate depreciation of certain generation related assets; (v) offset the standard offer generation rate (Market Generation Credit) by the amount of the Floating Competition Transition Charge; (vi) open its exclusive service territory to competition for generation service; (vii) assume the volatility and risk of market rates in 2009; and (viii) a rate check in 2004 when rates could not increase but could actually decrease. In the testimony, TEP states that if the ACC or other parties to the Settlement Agreement seek to unilaterally change the contract and order TEP back to cost of service, which is a breach that will force TEP to protect its rights in court and seek an order, which may include an award for damages. TEP states that, if the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement, does not agree to one of TEPs alternative proposals, and orders that TEPs generation service rates will be based on traditional cost of service ratemaking without compensating TEP for the financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, then TEP must: (1) file a rate case and (2) immediately file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages arising from the ACCs breach of the Settlement Agreement. TEP states that the financial impacts and costs directly attributable to the Settlement Agreement exceed $850 million. In the testimony, TEP offered alternatives to charging market based generation service rates after December 31, 2008, as described below. The Market Phase In Proposal TEP proposed a market rate phase in plan in the event that the ACC desires to maintain a competitive wholesale generation market, but wants to mitigate the immediate impact of market rates. Elements of the market rate phase in include: A cap would be set such that no customer class would realize an initial rate increase in excess of 12%. The phase in period would begin in 2009, last approximately four years and then be fully market based; TEPs current rates would remain frozen through the end of 2008; and Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs. The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal TEPs cost of service proposal presents a framework for returning TEP to cost of service regulation for generation service if the ACC determines that it will abandon the concept of a competitive wholesale and retail generation market. Elements of the proposal include: A new regulatory asset of $850 million to be included in rate base will be created to compensate TEP for the financial impacts and costs incurred in performing under the Settlement Agreement; An energy cost adjustment clause (ECAC) to recover energy costs associated with serving the incremental retail load above that filed in its cost of service test year; Immediate filing of a cost of service rate case in 2007; K 44 Table of Contents Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs; and Restore exclusivity of TEPs certificate of convenience and necessity. The proposed ECAC would differ from some other purchase power and fuel clauses in that it would not include any fuel or purchased power price risks or plant operating risks associated with serving the test year portion of TEPs retail load. Also, the ECAC would not be a straight pass through of purchased power costs to serve the incremental load. In the event that TEPs actual fuel and purchased power costs related to the incremental load exceeds the ECAC rate, TEP would not be able to pass the excess costs through to customers. However, in the event that those costs are less than the ECAC rate, TEP would be entitled to retain those earnings. If the ACC adopts TEPs cost of service proposal and approves a new regulatory asset of $850 million and implementation of the ECAC mechanism, TEP expects that its average retail rate in 2009 would increase by approximately 26% over current rates. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate or purchase at least 15% of their total annual retail energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025, with smaller amounts required in earlier years starting when the REST tariff submitted by an affected utility is approved by the ACC. To provide an opportunity for full recovery of the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the adopted REST rules allow for a new tariff to be implemented separate and apart from the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. The rules require affected utilities to annually file with the ACC a REST tariff request with a REST implementation plan to recover the cost of purchasing or installing and operating the renewable resources. The tariff amount is annually subject to ACC approval. The REST rules require utilities to file annual compliance reports outlining the results of the renewable programs implemented the prior year, highlighting steps they are taking to meet the REST annual renewable energy requirements. The REST rules adopted by the ACC must be certified by the Arizona Attorney General before taking effect. As of February 23, 2007, the Attorney General had not issued an opinion certifying the REST rules. Western Energy Markets As a participant in the Western U.S. wholesale power markets, TEP is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions and market participants. TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy at market based rates in the wholesale market. At the end of 2006, electric generating capacity in Arizona was approximately 25,600 MW, an increase of 61% since 2001. A majority of the growth is the result of 17 new or upgraded gas fired generating units with a combined capacity of approximately 9,700 MW. The completion of Springerville Unit 3 in 2006 provided 400 MW of new coal fired generation located in Arizona. Market Prices The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index decreased in 2006, as did the average price for natural gas based on the Permian Index. We cannot predict whether changes in various factors that influence demand and supply will cause prices to change during 2007. K 45 Table of Contents Average Market Price for Around the Clock Energy $/MWh Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 48 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 78 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 50 Year ended December 31, 2005 59 Average Market Price for Natural Gas $/MMBtu Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 5.58 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 9.67 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 6.05 Year ended December 31, 2005 7.17 In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel and gas indexed purchased power with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP currently has approximately 35% of this exposure hedged for the summer peak period of 2007 (June September) at a weighted average price of $7.18 per MMBtu. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. Market prices may also affect TEPs wholesale revenues. TEP commits to future sales of energy as part of its ongoing efforts to hedge its excess generation based on projected generation capability, forward prices and generation costs. For the first quarter of 2007, TEP has sold forward approximately 255,000 MWh at an average price of $70 per MWh, which excludes on peak hours in April through September. We expect the market price and demand for capacity and energy to continue to be influenced by factors including: availability and price of natural gas; weather; continued population growth in the Western U.S.; economic conditions in the Western U.S.; availability of generating capacity throughout the Western U.S.; the extent of electric utility industry restructuring in Arizona, California and other Western states; FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets; availability of hydropower; transmission constraints; and environmental regulations and the cost of compliance. Coal Supply On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The cost of coal and transportation under the agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. Based on these agreements, and increases at other coal fired plants, we expect TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants to increase by approximately $17 million, or 9% in 2007. Emission Allowances TEP has SO2 Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to operate its generating units. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. From time to time, TEP will sell a portion of its excess SO2 Emission Allowances. The table below summarizes sales made in 2005 and 2006, and forward sales of SO2 Emission Allowances, as of December 31, 2006. K 46 Table of Contents Delivery Allowances Sold Pre tax Gain (millions) 2005 15,000 $13 2006 10,000 7 2007 10,000 8 In addition to the allowances contracted to be sold in 2007, TEP expects to have approximately 20,000 excess SO2 Emission Allowances through 2009. Springerville Units 3 and 4 Springerville Unit 3, which commenced commercial operation in July 2006, is a 400 MW coal fired generating facility located at the same site as Springerville Units 1 and 2. Tri State is leasing 100% of Unit 3 from a financial owner. TEP allocates a portion of the fixed costs of the existing common facilities to the additional generating unit. TEP operates Unit 3 and will receive annual pre tax benefits of approximately $15 million in the form of transmission revenues, rental payments and other fees and cost savings. As part of the project, Tri State provided funding to improve sulfur dioxide scrubbers, low nitrogen oxide burners and other emission control upgrades for Units 1 and 2, which were completed in 2005. SRP is purchasing 100 MW of capacity from Tri State under a 30 year power purchase agreement. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired generating facility at the same Springerville site. Construction of Unit 4 has begun and, under the terms of existing regulatory permits, is required to be completed by December 31, 2009. Prior to Unit 4s completion, TEP may be required, along with Tri State, to exercise best efforts to find a replacement purchaser for SRP to purchase 100 MW of capacity from Unit 3. If TEP and Tri State are unable to find such a replacement purchaser, TEP would then purchase 100 MW of output from Unit 4, beginning with the commercial operation of Unit 4. Given the current level of wholesale power market prices, we believe it is unlikely that TEP would be required to find a replacement purchaser or to purchase SRPs 100 MW. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TEP Cash Flows During 2007, TEP expects to generate sufficient internal cash flows to fund most of its construction expenditures as well as its operating activities, required debt maturities and dividends to UniSource Energy. Cash flows may vary during the year, with cash flow from operations typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. As a result of the varied seasonal cash flow, TEP will use, as needed, its revolving credit facility to fund its business activities. The table below shows the cash available to TEP after capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and payments on capital lease obligations: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Capital Expenditures (156 ) (150 ) (129 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Scheduled Repayments of Long Term Debt (2 ) Less: Retirement of Capital Lease Obligations (61 ) (53 ) (49 ) Plus: Proceeds from Investment in Lease Debt 22 14 12 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* $ 32 $ 54 $ 107 K 47 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Net Cash Flows Investing Activities (GAAP) (182 ) (129 ) (126 ) Net Cash Flows Financing Activities (GAAP) (79 ) (174 ) (101 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* 32 54 107 * Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments, both non GAAP measures of liquidity, should not be considered as alternatives to Net Cash Flows Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity. We believe that Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments provide useful information to investors as measures of liquidity and our ability to fund our capital requirements, make required payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and pay dividends to UniSource Energy. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures, TEP may use its revolving credit facility on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements from TEPs strong customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of TEPs rate related proceedings. Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities decreased by $16 million compared with the same period in 2005. Net cash flows were impacted by: 2006 included: a $28 million increase in cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs, due primarily to retail customer growth, higher availability of excess power to sell into the wholesale market; and the availability of Luna to offset some of TEPs purchased power requirements; and a $16 million decrease in total interest paid due to lower capital lease obligation balances, lower long term debt balances and lower annual fees under the TEP credit agreement that was entered into in May 2005 and amended in August 2006; a $20 million increase in other cash receipts due primarily to payments from Tri State for fees and the reimbursement of operating costs related to Springerville Unit 3; offset by a $42 million increase in income taxes paid due to a $31 million payment made to the IRS and state authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments; an $11 million increase in O&M costs due primarily to operating costs at Luna and higher generating plant maintenance costs; an $8 million decline in proceeds from the sale of excess emission allowances; a $4 million increase in taxes other than income taxes; and a $3 million increase in wages paid. 2005 included: $11 million of interest received from UniSource Energy related to an inter company note repaid in the first quarter of 2005. K 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $53 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to: a $9 million increase in proceeds from investments in Springerville Lease Debt; offset by a $6 million increase in capital expenditures related to TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna and growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; and TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease, which represents approximately 53 MW of capacity. Capital Expenditures TEPs forecasted capital expenditures are summarized below: Category 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars Transmission, Distribution and Other Facilities $ 144 $ 149 $ 120 $ 183 $ 184 Generation Facilities 36 47 67 33 98 Environmental 18 42 8 8 10 Total $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 292 Capital expenditures for TEP of $855 million for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $216 million, or 34% higher than our 2005 forecast. This increase is the result of several factors including: strong customer growth; higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; the reinforcement and expansion of distribution lines; and environmental upgrades to generating facilities. These estimated expenditures include costs for TEP to comply with current federal and state environmental regulations. These estimates do not include the costs to construct the proposed Tucson to Nogales, Arizona transmission line. All of these estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual construction expenditures may be different from these estimates due to changes in business conditions, construction schedules, environmental requirements, and changes to TEPs business arising from retail competition. TEP plans to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash flow. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line If all regulatory approvals are received, the future costs to construct the transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona is expected to be approximately $95 million. Through December 31, 2006, approximately $11 million in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses have been incurred on this project. If the required approvals are not received, TEP may be required to expense a portion of the costs that have been capitalized related to the project, propose alternative methods to the ACC for improving reliability and spend additional amounts to implement such alternatives. See Item 1. Business, Tucson Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. In addition to TEPs forecasted capital expenditures for construction, TEPs other capital requirements include its required debt maturities and capital lease obligations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities, and Capital Lease Obligations. Investments in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity At December 31, 2006, TEP had $181 million of investments in lease debt and equity on its balance sheet. The yields on TEPs investments in Springerville Lease Debt, at the date of purchase, range from 8.9% to 12.7%. The table below provides a summary of the investment balances in lease debt.

The following factors contributed to the decrease: 2006 included: a $30 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility; offset by a $16 million increase in dividends paid to UniSource Energy; and an $8 million increase in scheduled payments made on capital lease obligations. 2005 included: a $110 million equity investment by UniSource Energy; and $95 million from UniSource Energy as a repayment for an inter company loan; offset by $282 million to repay long term debt; $5 million for debt issuance and retirement costs. At December 31, 2006, there were $30 million in outstanding borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility. TEP Credit Agreement In August 2006, TEP amended and restated its existing credit agreement (TEP Credit Agreement). The amendment reduced the interest rate and fees payable on TEPs borrowings and letters of credit, increased the amount of its revolving credit facility to $150 million from $60 million, and extended the maturity to August 2011 from May 2010. In addition to the revolving credit facility, the TEP Credit Agreement includes a $341 million letter of credit facility which supports $329 million of tax exempt variable rate bonds. The TEP Credit Agreement is secured by $491 million of 1992 Mortgage Bonds. Interest rates and fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 0.55% per annum and amounts drawn under a letter of credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum. TEP has the option of paying interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 0.55% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The TEP Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and sale leaseback agreements. The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP to meet a minimum cash coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement, it may pay dividends to UniSource Energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the TEP Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the TEP Credit Agreement; change in control, as defined; failure of TEP or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million; or certain bankruptcy events at TEP or certain subsidiaries. K 50 Table of Contents Springerville Common Facilities Leases In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one half ownership interest in the common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station. TEP refinanced the lease debt totaling $68 million in June 2006. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The refinancing had no impact on the Springerville Common Facilities capital lease obligation or asset. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. The LIBOR rate in effect on December 31, 2006 was 5.63%, and 3.68% on December 31, 2005, which resulted in a total interest rate on the lease debt of 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy In March 2005, UniSource Energy repaid to TEP a debt obligation in the principal amount of $95 million plus accrued interest of $11 million. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Capital Contribution from UniSource Energy In May 2005, UniSource Energy made a $110 million capital contribution to TEP. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Bond Repurchases and Redemptions TEP made a sinking fund payment of $1 million on its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs in January 2005. In March 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $31 million of its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2008, as well as the remaining $21 million of its 7.5% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2006. In May 2005, TEP used the proceeds from the repayment of the note from UniSource Energy and the capital contribution from UniSource Energy to purchase $147 million of its 1997 Pima Series B and $74 million of its 1997 Pima Series C fixed rate tax exempt bonds (Repurchased Bonds) at a price of $101.50 per $100 principal amount. In May 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $4 million of bonds outstanding under those series. TEP does not currently plan on canceling the Repurchased Bonds, which will remain outstanding under their respective indentures; however, the Repurchased Bonds will not be presented in our financial statements. TEP may choose to resell the Repurchased Bonds to third parties or cancel them in the future. Mortgage Indentures In June 2005, TEP terminated its 1941 Mortgage (formerly known as its First Mortgage). TEPs remaining mortgage is its 1992 Mortgage (formerly known as its Second Mortgage). TEPs mortgage indenture creates a lien on and security interest in most of TEPs utility plant assets. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos, is not subject to this lien and security interest. TEPs mortgage indenture allows TEP to issue additional mortgage bonds on the basis of (1) a percentage of net utility property additions and or (2) the principal amount of retired mortgage bonds. The amount of bonds that TEP may issue is also subject to a net earnings test under the indenture. TEPs Credit Agreement, which totals $491 million and is secured by 1992 Mortgage Bonds, limits the amount of mortgage bonds that may be outstanding to no more than $840 million. At December 31, 2006, TEP had a total of $629 million in outstanding mortgage bonds, consisting of $491 million in bonds securing the TEP Credit Agreement, and $138 million in bonds securing the 7.50% Collateral Trust Bonds due in 2008. Although the 1992 Mortgage would allow TEP to issue additional bonds, the limit imposed by the TEP Credit Agreement is more restrictive and is currently the governing limitation. K 51 Table of Contents Tax Exempt Local Furnishing Bonds TEP has financed a substantial portion of utility plant assets with industrial development revenue bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authorities of Pima County and Apache County. The interest on these bonds is excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal tax purposes. This exclusion is allowed because the facilities qualify as facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. These bonds are sometimes referred to as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. To qualify for this exclusion, the facilities must be part of a system providing electric service to customers within not more than two contiguous counties. TEP provides electric service to retail customers in the City of Tucson and certain other portions of Pima County, Arizona and to Fort Huachuca in contiguous Cochise County, Arizona. TEP has financed the following facilities, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of tax exempt local furnishing bonds: Springerville Unit 2, Sundt Unit 4, a dedicated 345 kV transmission line from Springerville Unit 2 to TEPs retail service area (the Express Line), and a portion of TEPs local transmission and distribution system in the Tucson metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had approximately $359 million of tax exempt local furnishing bonds outstanding. Approximately $257 million in principal amount of such bonds financed Springerville Unit 2 and the Express Line. In addition, approximately $38 million of remaining lease debt related to the Sundt Unit 4 lease obligation was issued as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. Various events might cause TEP to have to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds: formation of an RTO or ISO; asset divestiture; changes in tax laws; or changes in system operations. TEP believes that its qualification as a local furnishing system should not be lost so long as (1) the RTO or ISO would not change the operation of the Express Line or the transmission facilities within TEPs local service area, (2) the RTO or ISO allows pricing of transmission service such that the benefits of tax exempt financing continue to accrue to retail customers, and (3) energy produced by Springerville Unit 2 and TEPs local generating units continues to be consumed in TEPs local service area. However, there is no assurance that such qualification can be maintained. Any redemption or defeasance of these bonds would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater amount. Capital Lease Obligations At December 31, 2006, TEP had $647 million of total capital lease obligations on its balance sheet. The table below provides a summary of the outstanding lease amounts in each of the obligations. Leased Asset Capital Lease Obligation Balance at December 31, 2006 Expiration In Millions Springerville Unit 1 $381 2015 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 112 2015 Springerville Common Facilities 107 2020 Sundt Unit 4 46 2011 Other Leases 1 2008 Total Capital Lease Obligations $647 Except for TEPs 14% equity ownership in the Springerville Unit 1 Leases and its 13% equity ownership in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, TEP will not own these assets at the expiration of the leases. TEP may renew the leases or purchase the leased assets at such time. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, while the purchase price option is fixed for the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Facilities. See UniSource Energy, Contractual Obligations, footnote (3), for more information about the fixed purchase price amounts.

We have no other commercial commitments to report. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: TEPs Credit Agreement contains pricing for its Revolving Credit Facility based on TEPs credit ratings. A change in TEPs credit ratings can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of interest TEP pays on its borrowings. TEPs Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including interest coverage and leverage tests. Failure to comply with these covenants would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with these covenants. See TEP Credit Agreement, above. TEP conducts its wholesale marketing and risk management activities under certain master agreements whereby TEP may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values, a change in TEPs credit ratings or if there has been a material change in TEPs creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, TEP has not been required to post such credit enhancement. Dividends on Common Stock TEP declared and paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $62 million in 2006, $46 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. TEP can pay dividends if it maintains compliance with the TEP Credit Agreement and certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. K 53 Table of Contents The Federal Power Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital accounts. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe that there is a reasonable basis to pay dividends from current year earnings. UNS GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UniSource Energy formed two operating companies, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, to acquire the Arizona electric and gas assets from Citizens in 2003, as well as an intermediate holding company, UES, to hold the common stock of UNS Gas and UNS Electric. UNS Gas reported net income of $4 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $6 million in 2004. We expect operations at UNS Gas to vary with the seasons, with peak energy usage occurring in the winter months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had approximately 145,000 retail customers, a 5% increase from last year. The table below shows UNS Gas therm sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Sales Revenues 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Therms Millions of Dollars Retail Therm Sales: Residential 70 69 71 $ 96 $ 79 $ 76 Commercial 30 29 29 38 29 28 Industrial 3 3 3 3 2 2 Public Authorities 7 7 7 8 7 6 Total Retail Therm Sales 110 108 110 145 117 112 Transport 23 27 3 3 3 Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) 17 21 21 12 16 12 Total Therm Sales 150 156 131 $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Through a Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) approved by the ACC, UNS Gas supplies natural gas to some of its large transportation customers. Approximately one half of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas while the remainder benefits retail customers through a credit to the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. The table below provides summary financial information for UNS Gas. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Gas Revenues $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Other Revenues 2 2 2 Total Operating Revenues 162 138 129 Purchased Energy Expense 114 91 82 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 25 23 23 Depreciation and Amortization 7 7 5 Taxes other than Income Taxes 3 3 3 Total Other Operating Expenses 149 124 113 Operating Income 13 14 16 Total Other Income 1 Total Interest Expense 7 6 6 Income Tax Expense 3 3 4 Net Income $ 4 $ 5 $ 6 K 54 Table of Contents Retail therm sales were 2% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. In 2006, retail revenues increased $24 million and purchased energy expense increased $23 million, due primarily to the PGA surcharge increase, which became effective in November 2005. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation Energy, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Gas retail rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism. The PGA mechanism has two components, the PGA factor and the PGA surcharge or credit. The PGA factor is a mechanism that compares the twelve month rolling weighted average gas cost to the base cost of gas, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve month period. The actual gas and transportation costs that are either under or over collected through the base rate of $0.40 per therm or $4.00 per MMBtu and the PGA factor are charged or credited to a balancing account (PGA bank). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the average PGA factor was approximately $0.33 per therm or $3.33 per MMBtu. The current annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor is $0.10 per therm in a twelve month period. As part of its general rate case proceeding with the ACC, UNS Gas requested to remove the cap to allow for more timely recovery of actual gas costs. See General Rate Case Filing, below. When the ACC designated under or over recovery trigger points of $6.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge or credit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred from or to customers over a period deemed appropriate by the ACC. On December 31, 2006, the PGA bank balance was over collected by $2 million on the basis as billed to customers. In December 2006, the ACC approved a proposal by UNS Gas that lowered the PGA surcharge to $0.05 per therm. The $0.05 per therm PGA surcharge will remain in effect through April 2007. Based on current projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the lower surcharge amount will allow it to timely recover its gas costs and still provide rate relief to its customers. Changes in the market price for gas, sales volumes and surcharge amount could significantly change the PGA bank balance in the future. General Rate Case Filing UNS Gas current rates have been in place since August 2003 and were designed to provide a 9.05% return on original cost rate base of $118 million. As a result of increased growth in UNS Gas service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Gas to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Gas request: Test year Year ended December 31, 2005 Original cost rate base $162 million Revenue deficiency $10 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 7% Cost of debt 6.60% Cost of equity 11.00% Hypothetical capital structure 50% equity / 50% debt Weighted average cost of capital 8.80% K 55 Table of Contents UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices, inappropriate price signals to customers and the potential for over or under collections to result in the accumulation of large bank balances. In February 2007, ACC staff filed testimony that indicated a revenue deficiency for UNS Gas of approximately $5 million; RUCOs testimony indicated a revenue deficiency of approximately $2 million. The procedural schedule for the UNS Gas rate case is as follows: Filing Date UNS Gas rebuttal testimony March 9, 2007 ACC Staff & intervenor rebuttal testimony March 30, 2007 UNS Gas rejoinder testimony April 6, 2007 Hearing before ALJ April 16, 2007 UNS Gas expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the second half of 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Gas capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $23 million. UNS Gas expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a large portion of its construction expenditures. If natural gas prices rise and UNS Gas is not allowed to recover its projected gas costs or PGA bank balance on a timely basis, UNS Gas may require additional funding to meet operating and capital requirements. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contribution from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Gas general rate case that was filed in July 2006. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 32 $ 14 $ 21 Capital Expenditures 23 23 19 Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Gas are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Gas $38 $33 $27 $28 $26 UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver In August 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric amended and restated their existing unsecured revolving credit agreement (UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver). The amendment reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings and, upon ACC approval, will increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to $60 million from $40 million, and extend the maturity from April 2008 to August 2011. Currently, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $30 million, but the total combined amount borrowed cannot exceed $40 million. Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. UNS Gas is only liable for UNS Gas borrowings, and similarly, UNS Electric is only liable for UNS Electrics borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. UES guarantees the obligations of both UNS Gas and UNS Electric. K 56 Table of Contents UNS Gas and UNS Electric have the option of paying interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver contains restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, mergers and sales of assets; it also contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for each borrower. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were each in compliance with the terms of the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. If an event of default occurs, the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, certain change in control transactions, certain bankruptcy events of UNS Gas or UNS Electric, or failure of UES, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to make payments or default on debt greater than $4 million. UNS Gas expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Gas had no outstanding borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Gas has $100 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding consisting of $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2011 and $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2015 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas restricts transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens, restricted payments and incurrence of indebtedness, and also contains a minimum net worth test. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Gas must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Gas may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $7 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Gas Supply Contracts UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005. The agreement was automatically extended one year and will continue to extend on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. Prices for incremental gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the market prices for the period during which the gas is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas hedged approximately 48% of its expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March). Additionally, UNS Gas has approximately 36% of its expected gas consumption hedged for April through October 2007, and 29% hedged for the period November 2007 through March 2008. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. UNS Gas currently has a transportation agreement with EPNG to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. This agreement has specific contract volumes in each month and specific receipt point rights from the available supply basins (San Juan and Permian). The average daily capacity rights of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March). EPNG filed a rate case in 2005 with new, higher rates effective in January 2006, subject to refund. The rate case participants reached a negotiated settlement and filed an agreement with FERC on December 6, 2006. FERC is expected to take action on the settlement agreement in the first half of 2007. UNS Gas contract with EPNG expires in August 2011, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. K 57 Table of Contents UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. The current contract with Transwestern expires in February 2007. UNS Gas entered into a new firm transportation contract with Transwestern through February 2012 with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. The new capacity rights under this agreement are: 250,000 therms per day October through April; 15,000 therms per day in May; and 10,000 therms per day June through September. Transwestern filed a rate case in October 2006 with new, higher rates to be effective in April 2007. The rate case participants are attempting to negotiate a settlement prior to the new rates becoming effective. The aggregate annual minimum transportation charges are expected to be approximately $9 million and $2 million for the EPNG and Transwestern contracts, respectively. These costs are passed through to our customers via the PGA. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Gas may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Gas will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures. UNS ELECTRIC RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNS Electric reported net income of $5 million in 2006 and 2005, and $4 million in 2004. Similar to TEPs operations, we expect UNS Electrics operations to be seasonal in nature, with peak energy demand occurring in the summer months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had approximately 93,000 retail customers, a 4% increase from last year. Retail kWh sales were 6% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. The table below shows UNS Electrics kWh sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The plan addressed all aspects of implementation. It included UNS Electrics unbundled distribution tariffs for both standard offer customers and customers that choose competitive retail access, as well as Direct Access and Settlement Fee schedules. UNS Electrics direct access rates for both transmission and ancillary services would be based upon its FERC Open Access Transmission Tariff. The plan is subject to review and approval by the ACC, which has not yet considered the plan. As a result of the court decisions concerning the ACCs Rules, we are unable to predict when and how the ACC will address this plan. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Competition, above for information regarding the Arizona Court of Appeals decision. Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Electrics retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit to the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under or over recovery of costs. The ACC has approved a PPFAC surcharge of $0.01825 per kWh to recover transmission costs and the cost of the current full requirements power supply agreement with PWMT. General Rate Case Filing UNS Electrics retail rates were last adjusted in August 2003. As a result of increased growth in UNS Electrics service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Electric to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Electrics request: Test year 12 months ended June 30, 2006 Original cost rate base $141 million Revenue deficiency $8.5 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 5.5% Cost of long term debt 8.2% Cost of equity 11.8% Actual capital structure 49% equity / 51% debt Weighted average cost of capital 9.9% K 59 Table of Contents The procedural schedule for the UNS Electric rate case is as follows: Filing Date ACC Staff and Intervenor testimony June 28, 2007 UNS Electric rebuttal testimony August 14, 2007 ACC Staff and Intervenor surrebuttal August 24, 2007 UNS Electric rejoinder testimony August 31, 2007 Hearing before ALJ September 10, 2007 UNS Electric also requested the ACC to approve the acquisition of the 90 MW BMGS combustion turbine project under development by UED with a post test year rate base adjustment effective June 1, 2008. The cost of the BMGS is expected to cost $60 million. UNS Electric expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in late 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. UNS Electric also requested that a new PPFAC surcharge take effect when the current power supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff See, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Electrics capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $39 million. UNS Electric expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a portion of its construction expenditures. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Electrics general rate case that was filed in December 2006. In June 2006, UniSource Energy contributed $10 million of capital to UNS Electric. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 14 $ 21 $ 19 Capital Expenditures 39 30 19 To improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County, UNS Electric completed a 20 MW gas fired combustion turbine at the Valencia site in 2006, and plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time. The turbine improves reliability while the approval and permitting process for the 345 kV Tucson to Nogales transmission line continues. In 2006, UNS Electrics capital expenditures included $7 million related to the turbine. See Item 1. Business, TEP Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Electric are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Electric $43 $40 $42 $27 $34 K 60 Table of Contents UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver See UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver above for description of UNS Electrics unsecured revolving credit agreement. UNS Electric expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. At February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had $25 million outstanding under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Electric has $60 million of 7.61% senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2008 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreements for UNS Electric contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens to secure indebtedness, restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness, and minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Electric must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Electric may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $5 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Electric Power Supply and Transmission Contracts UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT), which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price per MWh. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric is in the process of securing replacement energy resources when its supply contract ends with PWMT in 2008. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $27 million. The new UNS Electric power purchase contracts are subject to master agreements whereby UNS Electric may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values or if there has been a material change in creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had not been required to post such credit enhancement. UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electrics transmission capacity agreements with WAPA provide for annual rate adjustments and expire in February 2008 and June 2011. The contract that expires in 2008 also contains a capacity adjustment clause. Under the terms of the agreements, UNS Electrics aggregated minimum fixed transmission charges are expected to be $12 million in 2007 through 2011. UNS Electric made payments under these contracts of $8 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Electric contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Electric may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Electric will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures.

UED In 2006, UED purchased two electric generating turbines for $17 million. The turbines will be part of the 90 MW BMGS, to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, and, pending ACC approval is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. Construction is planned to begin during the third quarter of 2007 with an estimated completion date of May 2008. Including the purchase of the turbines, the total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $60 million. UED is financing the BMGS project with borrowings from UniSource Energy under an inter company note payable. At December 31, 2006, there was $22 million outstanding and interest is payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 1.25%. In 2005, UED had no significant operations. In 2004, UED recognized an impairment loss on its note receivable from an independent power producer. As UEDs recovery of the note receivable from the entity is subordinated to the rights of others, UED wrote off the entire $2 million balance due on the note at the time that Haddington, an investor in the independent power producer, determined that its investment was impaired. In 2004, UEDs net loss was $1 million. Discontinued Operations Global Solar Global Solar recorded losses of $2 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $5 million in 2004. On March 31, 2006, Millennium completed the sale of its interest in Global Solar. In these financial statements, UniSource Energy accounts for Global Solar as a discontinued operation and recognizes 100% of Global Solars losses. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Millennium Investments MEG is in the process of winding down its activities and does not expect to engage in any significant new activities. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of MEGs trading assets was $11 million and the fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million. Nations Energy Corporation (Nations Energy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, has been inactive since 2001. As of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, Nations Energy had a deferred tax asset of $3 million related to investment losses that has not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax return. K 62 Table of Contents Millennium is in the process of exiting its remaining investments. At December 31, 2006, the book value of Millenniums investments was $28 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Millennium made a $5 million dividend payment to UniSource Energy in February 2007 and is expected to make additional dividend payments totaling $10 million to UniSource Energy during the first half of 2007. In 2006, Millennium funded $2 million to Haddington under an existing commitment. In 2005, Haddington sold one of its investments and Millennium received a $6 million distribution related to the sale. In 2004, Millennium received a $7 million distribution from Haddington related to the gain on a sale of one of its investments. Millenniums remaining commitment is $1 million to Valley Ventures. In 2006, Millennium received the remaining payment of $5 million on a note receivable from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation and, in 2005, received a payment of $4 million. Millennium funded the remainder of its commitment to IPS in 2006. Millennium owns less than 10% of the equity of IPS. In 2005, Millennium received a $4 million payment from its investment in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V., (Sabinas) a Mexican limited liability company. The $4 million payment was treated as the return of capital and the book value of the investment in Sabinas was reduced to approximately $14 million. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. A $2 million payment due to Millennium in June 2006 was cancelled in exchange for payment by Mimosa, an affiliate of Sabinas, for up to $2 million to obtain a valuation of the interest in coal reserves and associated gas held by Mimosa. This evaluation is being performed under Millenniums direction, primarliy to determine the impact of current regulatory changes in Mexico on the value of the Sabinas investment. We expect the evaluation to be completed in 2007. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding required to fund Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. We believe such cash and returns will be adequate to fund Millenniums remaining commitments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. UniSource Energy and TEP consider Critical Accounting Estimates to be those that could result in materially different financial statement results if our assumptions regarding application of accounting principles were different. UniSource Energy and TEP describe their Critical Accounting Estimates below. Other significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates. Accounting for Rate Regulation TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric generally use the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (FAS 71), require special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to currently charge their customers to recover certain expenses, but instead may require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71 requires that TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are allowed to charge their customers. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then amortize these items as expense to the income statement as these charges are recovered from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced. The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of FAS 71 include: an independent regulator sets rates; the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering service; and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator. K 63 Table of Contents TEP Upon approval by the ACC of a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) in November 1999, TEP discontinued application of FAS 71 for its generation operations. TEP continues to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations, which include the transmission and distribution portions of its business. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $118 million at December 31, 2006. Regulatory assets of $61 million are not presently included in the rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. These regulatory assets are being recovered through the cost of service or are authorized to be collected in future base rates. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $163 million at December 31, 2005. TEP regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations. If TEP stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write off the related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2006, if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately $71 million. While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows, TEPs cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its regulatory assets. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $13 million at December 31, 2006 compared with regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities of $3 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electrics regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006 and $7 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electric has $11 million of regulatory liabilities and $1 million of regulatory assets that are not included in rate base. UNS Gas and UNS Electric regularly assess whether they can continue to apply FAS 71 to their cost based rate regulated operations. If UNS Gas and UNS Electric stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, they would write off the related balances of regulatory assets as an expense and regulatory liabilities as income on their income statements. Based on the balances of regulatory liabilities and assets at December 31, 2006, if UNS Gas and UNS Electric had stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, UNS Gas would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $8 million and UNS Electric would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $7 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics cash flows would not be affected if they stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited their ability to recover the cost of their regulatory assets. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, issued by the FASB, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred. A legal obligation is a liability that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract. A legal obligation can also be associated with the retirement of a long lived asset whose timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We are required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity should capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is adjusted to its present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the income statement each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the recorded amount. TEP In 2005, TEP implemented FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). The implementation of FIN 47 required TEP to update an existing inventory, originally created for the implementation of FAS 143, and to determine which, if any, of the conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated. The ability to reasonably estimate conditional asset retirement obligations was a matter of management judgment, based upon managements ability to estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, a method or potential method of settlement and probabilities associated with the potential dates and methods of settlement of TEPs conditional asset retirement obligations. In determining whether its conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated, management considered TEPs past practices, industry practices, managements intent and the estimated economic life of the assets. The fair value of the K 64 Table of Contents conditional asset retirement obligations were then estimated using an expected present value technique. Changes in managements assumptions regarding settlement dates, settlement methods or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liability recorded by TEP at December 31, 2006 as well as the associated cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded. The liabilities associated with conditional asset retirement obligations will be adjusted on an ongoing basis due to the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original estimates of undiscounted cash flows. These adjustments could have a significant impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information regarding the implementation and ongoing application of FIN 47, see Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Prior to implementing FAS 143, costs for final removal of all owned generation facilities were accrued as an additional component of depreciation expense. Under FAS 143, only the costs to remove an asset with legally binding retirement obligations will be accrued over time through accretion of the asset retirement obligation and depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had a liability of $4 million associated with its final asset retirement obligations. TEP has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets specified in land leases for its jointly owned Navajo and Four Corners Generating Stations. The land on which these stations reside is leased from the Navajo Nation. The provisions of the leases require the lessees to remove the facilities upon request of the Navajo Nation at the expiration of the leases. TEP also has certain environmental obligations at the San Juan Generating Station. TEP has estimated that its share of the cost to remove the Navajo and Four Corners facilities and settle the San Juan environmental obligations will be approximately $40 million at the date of retirement. No other legal obligations to retire generation plant assets were identified. In 2004, TEP, Phelps Dodge Energy Services, LLC and PNM Resources, Inc. each purchased from Duke Energy North America, LLC a one third interest in a limited liability company which owns the natural gas fired Luna Energy Facility (Luna) in Southern New Mexico. Luna is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was placed into commercial operation in April 2006. See Item 1. Business, Future Generating Resources TEP. The new owners assumed asset retirement obligations to remove certain piping and evaporation ponds and to restore the ground to its original condition. TEP has estimated its share to settle the obligations will be approximately $2 million at the date of retirement. TEP has various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. TEP operates its transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, TEP is not recognizing the costs of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had accrued $80 million for the net cost of removal for the interim retirements from its transmission, distribution and general plant. As of December 31, 2005, TEP had accrued $75 million for these removal costs. The amount is recorded as a regulatory liability. Amounts recorded under FAS 143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, estimating when final removal will occur, and the credit adjusted risk free interest rates to be used to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future as expense for asset retirement obligations. If TEP retires any asset at the end of its useful life, without a legal obligation to do so, it will record retirement costs at that time as incurred or accrued. TEP does not believe that the implementation of FAS 143 will result in any change in retail rates since all matters relating to the rate making treatment of TEPs generating assets have been determined pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric have various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. UNS Gas and UNS Electric operate their transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are not recognizing the cost of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. K 65 Table of Contents For the net cost of removal for interim retirements from transmission, distribution and general plant, UNS Gas accrued $4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $3 million as of December 31, 2005. UNS Electric accrued $2 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1 million as of December 31, 2005. The amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We record plan assets, obligations, and expenses related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions on discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries. TEP As a result of adopting FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in December 2006, TEP recognized the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability. The underfunded status was measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans. We expect volatility in the liability recognized in the balance sheet in future years as the funded status of our plans can change significantly due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience. The adjustment required to recognize the pension liability on adoption of this statement resulted in (i) recognition of a regulatory asset of $32 million representing a reasonable appropriation of the actuarial losses and prior service costs of TEPs pension plans that are probable of recovery in rates by its regulated operations in future periods and (ii) an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $17 million for our unregulated operations. We recorded the required increase in our other postretirement benefit obligation as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8 million as the ACC allows TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to recover other postretirement costs through rates only as benefit payments are made. Any change in the funded status of our plans due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience will be recognized as an adjustment to regulatory assets and other comprehensive income. TEP discounted its future pension plan obligations at 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP discounted its other postretirement plan obligations at a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP determines the discount rate annually based on the rates currently available on high quality, non callable, long term bonds. TEP looks to bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency whose future cash flows match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. For TEPs pension plans, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $7 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. A similar increase in the discount rate would decrease the PBO by approximately $8 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. For TEPs other postretirement benefit plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $2 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact plan expense by approximately $0.1 million. TEP calculates the market related value of plan assets using the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date. TEP assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.3% at December 31, 2006 and 8.5% at December 31, 2005. In establishing its assumption as to the expected return on plan assets, TEP reviews the plans asset allocation and develops return assumptions for each asset class based on advice from an investment consultant and the plans actuary that includes both historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets. Pension expense decreases as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases. A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact pension expense in 2007 by less than $0.5 million. TEP used an initial health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in valuing its postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2006. This rate reflects both market conditions and the plans experience. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A 1% increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. A similar decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. TEP will record pension expense of approximately $9 million and other postretirement benefit expense of $5 million ratably through 2007. TEP will make required pension plan K 66 Table of Contents contributions of $10 million in 2007. TEPs other postretirement benefit plan is not funded. TEP expects to make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $3 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted their future pension plan obligations using a rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. For UNS Gas and UNS Electrics pension plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact the benefit obligation and pension expense by less than $0.5 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record pension expense of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will make a pension plan contribution of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted its other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, compared with 5.8% at December 31, 2005. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record postretirement medical benefit expense and make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $0.1 million in 2007. Accounting for Derivative Instruments, Trading Activities and Hedging Activities A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from another investment or designated benchmark. TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically for one month, three months, or one year, within established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources (e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods). TEP enters into forward sales contracts when it forecasts that it has excess supply and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. A portion of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. However, some of these forward contracts which are derivatives satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Common Stock Equity, rather than being reflected in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments can be accounted for under multiple methods depending upon facts and circumstances, which can lead to variability in earnings. TEP has a natural gas supply agreement, that expires in February 2007, under which it purchases its gas requirements for its generating units located in Tucson, Arizona at spot market prices. TEP also has agreements to purchase power that are priced using spot market gas prices. These contracts meet the definition of normal purchases and are not required to be marked to market. In an effort to minimize price risk on these purchases, TEP enters into commodity price swap agreements under which TEP purchases gas at fixed prices and simultaneously sells gas at spot market prices. The spot market price in the swap agreements is tied to the same index as the purchases under the natural gas supply and purchased power contracts. These swap agreements, which expire during the summer months through 2009, were entered into with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of TEPs expected summer monthly gas risk prior to entering into the month. The swap agreements are marked to market on a monthly basis; however, since the agreements satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income rather than being reflected in the income statement. In June 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap in order to reduce the risk associated with unfavorable changes in variable interest rate payments related to changes in LIBOR. The swap has the effect of converting approximately $37 million of variable rate lease payments for the Springerville Common Lease to a fixed rate. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the interest rate swap is derived from models based on well recognized financial principles, which provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the swap as of the valuation date. Other models can be used to estimate the fair value of the swap and these models, which may use different assumptions or methods, may yield different results. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the swap is a liability of $2 million. TEP manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standardized agreement, which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. UNS Gas does not currently have any contracts that are required to be marked to market. UNS Gas does have a natural gas supply and management agreement under which it purchases substantially all of its gas requirements K 67 Table of Contents at market prices from BP Energy Company (BP). However, the contract terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its gas purchases by entering into fixed price forward contracts with BP at various times during the year. This enables UNS Gas to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of the expected monthly gas consumption prior to entering into the month. These forward contracts, as well as the main gas supply contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and therefore are not required to be marked to market. UNS Electric presently has a full requirements power supply agreement that enables it to meet its load. The agreement expires May 31, 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. In order to reduce exposure to energy price risk resulting from the procurement of power, UNS Electric has entered into forward power purchase contracts for specified amounts of energy at specified prices over a given period of time, within established limits. UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative and are marked to market by recording unrealized gains or losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In December 2006, the ACC issued an order allowing UNS Electric to record the unrealized net gains or losses as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. MEG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to Emission Allowances. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In accordance with UniSource Energys intention to cease making capital contributions to Millennium, Millennium has significantly reduced the holdings and activity of MEG. MEGs activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP, UNS Electric and MEGs derivative instruments at December 31, 2006, are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value. For TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. For MEGs remaining trading contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $0.1 million. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG). To date, the DIG has issued more than 100 interpretations to provide guidance in applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). As the DIG or the FASB continues to issue interpretations, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may change the conclusions they have reached and, as a result, the accounting treatment and financial statement impact could change in the future. See Market Risks Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A. K 68 Table of Contents Unbilled Revenue TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric TEPs, UNS Gass and UNS Electrics retail revenues include an estimate of MWhs/therms delivered but unbilled at the end of each period. Unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require managements judgment including estimates of retail sales and customer usage patterns. The unbilled revenue is estimated by comparing the estimated MWhs/therms delivered to the MWhs/therms billed to TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric retail customers. The excess of estimated MWhs/therms delivered over MWhs/therms billed is then allocated to the retail customer classes based on estimated usage by each customer class. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then record revenue for each customer class based on the various bill rates for each customer class. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of TEPs actual load, the unbilled revenue amount increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. The unbilled revenue amount for UNS Gas sales increases during the fall and winter months and decreases during the spring and summer months, whereas, the unbilled revenue amount for UNS Electric sales increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. Plant Asset Depreciable Lives TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric We calculate depreciation expense based on our estimate of the useful lives of our plant assets. The estimated useful lives, and resulting depreciation rates used to calculate depreciation expense for the transmission and distribution businesses of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have been approved by the ACC in prior rate decisions. Depreciation rates for transmission and distribution cannot be changed without ACC approval. The estimated remaining useful lives of TEPs generating facilities are based on managements best estimate of the economic life of the units. These estimates are based on engineering estimates, economic analysis, and statistical analysis of TEPs past experience in maintaining the stations. Our generation assets are currently depreciated over periods ranging from 23 to 70 years from the original in service dates. During the second quarter of 2005, a study requested by the participants in the San Juan Generating Station was completed which indicated San Juans economic useful life had changed from previous estimates. As a result of the study and other analysis performed, TEP lengthened the estimated useful life of San Juan from 40 to 60 years beginning April 1, 2005. TEPs annual depreciation expense related to San Juan decreased by $6 million as a result. During the first quarter of 2004, TEP engaged an independent third party to review the economic estimated useful lives of its owned generating assets in Springerville, Arizona. TEP then hired another independent third party to perform a depreciation study for its generation assets, taking into consideration the newly determined economic useful life for the Springerville assets, and changes in generation plant life information used by the operators and other participants of the joint power plants in which TEP participates. As a result of these analyses, TEP lengthened the useful lives of various generation assets for periods ranging from 11 to 22 years in July 2004. Consequently, depreciation rates and the corresponding depreciation expense have been revised prospectively to reflect the life extensions. The annual impact of these changes in depreciation rates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $9 million. Deferred Tax Valuation We record deferred tax liabilities for amounts that will increase income taxes on future tax returns. We record deferred tax assets for amounts that could be used to reduce income taxes on future tax returns. We record a valuation allowance, or reserve, for the deferred tax asset amount that we may not be able to use on future tax returns. We estimate the valuation allowance based on our interpretation of the tax rules, prior tax audits, tax planning strategies, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future taxable income. At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy had no valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, UniSource Energy had a valuation allowance of $7 million relating to net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amounts. The $7 million valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2005, relates to losses generated by the Millennium entities. As a result of the sale of Global Solar, the NOL and related valuation allowance were removed from the UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, UniSource Energys deferred income tax assets include $7 million and $9 million, respectively, related to unregulated investment losses of Millennium. These losses have not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax returns. If UniSource Energy were unable to K 69 Table of Contents recognize such losses through its consolidated income tax return in the foreseeable future, UniSource Energy would be required to write off these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, TEP had no valuation allowance. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB recently issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), FASB Interpretations (FIN), FASB Staff Positions (FSP), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issues (EITF): EITF 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation), approved June 2006, requires that we disclose our accounting policy regarding presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. Additionally, we must disclose the amounts of any taxes reported on a gross basis in interim and annual financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosures. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS 109, issued July 2006, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 requires disclosure of a rollforward of total unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. TEP recognized between $1 million and $2 million of income as an increase to Common Stock Equity on January 1, 2007 on the adoption of FIN 48. FAS 157, Fair Value Measurement, issued September 2006, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 clarifies that the exchange price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. We are required to disclose inputs used to develop fair value measurements and the effect of any of our assumptions on earnings or changes in net assets for the period. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our financial statements, and will incorporate these additional disclosure requirements in our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, issued September 2006, prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As we do not accrue planned major maintenance activities in advance, we anticipate no impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this FSP. FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, issued September 2006, requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and benefit obligation. FAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the incremental effect of adopting FAS 158. In the third quarter of 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law, which will be effective January 1, 2008. The new law will affect the manner in which many companies, including UniSource Energy and TEP, administer their pension plans. The legislation will require companies to increase the amount by which they fund their pension plans, increase premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for defined benefit plans, amend plan documents and provide additional disclosures in regulatory filings and to plan participants. We are currently assessing the impact it may have on our financial statements. SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. UniSource Energy and TEP are including the following cautionary statements to K 70 Table of Contents make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward looking statements made by or for UniSource Energy or TEP in this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

These may be in addition to other factors and matters discussed in other parts of this report: 1. Supply and demand conditions in wholesale energy markets, including volatility in market prices and illiquidity in markets, are affected by a variety of factors, which include the availability of generating capacity in the western U.S., including hydroelectric resources, weather, natural gas prices, the extent of utility restructuring in various states, transmission constraints, environmental regulations and cost of compliance, FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets, and economic conditions in the western U.S. 2. Effects of competition in retail and wholesale energy markets. 3. Changes in economic conditions, demographic patterns and weather conditions in our retail service areas. 4. Effects of restructuring initiatives in the electric industry and other energy related industries. 5. The creditworthiness of the entities with which we transact business or have transacted business. 6. Changes affecting our cost of providing electric and gas service including changes in fuel costs, generating unit operating performance, scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, interest rates, tax laws, environmental laws, and the general rate of inflation. 7. Changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions with respect to financing and rate structures. 8. Changes affecting the cost of competing energy alternatives, including changes in available generating technologies and changes in the cost of natural gas. 9. Changes in accounting principles or the application of such principles to our businesses. 10. Changes in the depreciable lives of our assets. 11. Unanticipated changes in future liabilities relating to employee benefit plans due to changes in market values of retirement plan assets and health care costs. 12. The outcome of any ongoing or future litigation. 13. Ability to obtain financing through debt and or equity issuance, which can be affected by various factors, including interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks We are exposed to various forms of market risk. Changes in interest rates, returns on marketable securities, and changes in commodity prices may affect our future financial results. K 71 Table of Contents For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements, above. Risk Management Committee We have a Risk Management Committee responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to the wholesale energy marketing activities of TEP, the emissions and trading activities of MEG, and the fuel and power procurement activities at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. Our Risk Management Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis and as needed, consists of officers from the finance, accounting, legal, wholesale marketing, transmission and distribution operations, and the generation operations departments of UniSource Energy. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to commodity price risk, the Risk Management Committee sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to credit risk, the Risk Management Committee reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits. Interest Rate Risk TEP is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on certain of its variable rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEPs debt included $329 million of tax exempt variable rate debt. The average interest rate on TEPs variable rate debt (excluding letter of credit fees) was 3.47% in 2006 and 2.48% in 2005. In June 2006, TEP refinanced variable rate lease debt totaling $68 million related to its Springerville Common Facilities Leases. The notes underlying the leases mature in June 2017 and January 2020. The notes were amended to provide that interest will be payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The interest rate in effect on the lease debt was 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. A 1% increase (decrease) in average interest rates would result in a decrease (increase) in TEPs pre tax income by approximately $4 million. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. Marketable Securities Risk TEP is exposed to fluctuations in the return on its marketable securities, which is comprised of investments in debt securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEP had marketable debt securities with an estimated fair value of $139 million and $165 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These debt securities represent TEPs investments in lease debt underlying certain of TEPs capital lease obligations. Changes in the fair value of such debt securities do not present a material risk to TEP, as TEP intends to hold these investments to maturity. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances. TEP Purchases and Sales of Energy To manage its exposure to energy price risk, TEP enters into forward contracts to buy or sell energy at a specified price and future delivery period. Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected excess generating capability, forward prices and generation costs, using a diversified market approach to provide a balance between long term, mid term and spot energy sales. TEP generally enters into forward purchases during its summer peaking period to ensure it can meet its load and reserve requirements and account for other contracts and resource contingencies. TEP also enters into limited forward purchases and sales to optimize its resource portfolio and take advantage of locational differences in price. These positions are managed on both a volumetric and dollar basis and are closely monitored using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk K 72 Table of Contents Management Committee. For example, the risk management policies provide that TEP should not take a short position in the third quarter and must have owned generation backing up all forward sales positions at the time the sale is made. TEPs risk management policies also restrict entering into forward positions with maturities extending beyond the end of the next calendar year except for approved hedging purposes. The majority of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales of electric energy and are not considered to be derivatives under FAS 133. TEP records revenues on its normal sales and expenses on its normal purchases in the period in which the energy is delivered. From time to time, however, TEP enters into forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. When TEP has derivative forward contracts, it marks them to market using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers for power traded over the counter at Palo Verde and at other southwestern U.S. trading hubs. TEP believes that these broker quotations used to calculate the mark to market values represent accurate measures of the fair values of TEPs positions because of the short term nature of TEPs positions, as limited by risk management policies, and the liquidity in the short term market. To adjust the value of its derivative forward power sales and purchases, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $6 $(1) $ TEP also reported the following net unrealized gains and losses on forward power sales and purchases in Wholesale Sales and Purchased Power. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $1 $(1) $2 TEP uses sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an unfavorable change in market prices on the fair value of its derivative forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Natural Gas TEP is also subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of natural gas. In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and to meet local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchase power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. In 2006, the average market price of natural gas was $6.05 per MMBtu, or 16% lower than 2005. The table below summarizes TEPs gas generation output and purchased power for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of MWhs % of Total Resources Gas Fired Generation 848 368 432 6% 3% 3% Purchased Power 1,644 1,639 1,322 12% 13% 10% K 73 Table of Contents To adjust the value of its derivative gas swap contracts, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Unrealized Gain (Loss) $(17) $11 $3 As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. Coal TEP is subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of coal used to fuel its coal fired generating plants. In 2003, TEP amended and extended the long term coal supply contract for Springerville Units 1 and 2 through 2020 and expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. During the extension period from 2011 through 2020, the coal price will be determined by the cost of Powder River Basin coal delivered to Springerville Unit 3 subject to a floor and ceiling. Based on current coal market conditions, this range would be from $24 to $30 per ton. TEP estimates its future minimum annual payments under this contract to be $45 million through 2010, the initial contract expiration date, and $14 million from 2011 through 2020. TEPs coal transportation contract at Springerville runs through June of 2011. TEP estimates minimum annual payments under this contract to be $13 million through 2010 and $7 million in 2011. In December 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through December 2008. Although TEP expects to pay $20 million annually, the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. In 2007, the impact on TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants is expected to increase by $17 million, or 9%. The long term rail contract for Sundt Unit 4 is in effect until the earliest of 2015, the remaining life of Sundt Unit 4 or the life of the coal mine. This rail contract requires TEP to transport at least 75,000 tons of coal per year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $2 million or to make a minimum payment of $1 million. TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan, where coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. In 2003, the Four Corners coal contract was extended through July 2016. This contract requires TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated annual cost of $6 million. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. The contracts to purchase coal for use at the jointly owned facilities require TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated average annual cost of $21 million for the next five years. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. UNS Gas UNS Gas is subject to commodity price risk, primarily from the changes in the price of natural gas purchased for its customers. This risk is mitigated through the PGA mechanism which provides an adjustment to UNS Gas retail rates to recover the actual costs of gas and transportation. UNS Gas further reduces this risk by purchasing forward fixed price contracts for a portion of its projected gas needs under its Price Stabilization Plan. UNS Gas purchases at least 45% of its estimated gas needs in this manner. UNS Electric UNS Electric is currently not exposed to commodity price risk for its purchase of electricity as it has a fixed price full requirements supply agreement with PWMT and a PPFAC mechanism which fully recovers the costs incurred K 74 Table of Contents under such contract on a timely basis. This supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $23 million. Because a portion of the costs under these contracts will vary from period to period based on the market price of gas, the PPFAC, as currently structured, may not provide recovery of the costs incurred under these new contracts on a timely basis. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. MEG MEG trades Emission Allowances and related instruments; however, its current activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. We manage the market risk of this line of business by setting notional limits by product, as well as limits to the potential change in fair market value under a 33% change in price or volatility. We closely monitor MEGs trading activities, which include swap agreements, options and forward contracts, using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk Management Committee. MEG marks its trading positions to market on a daily basis using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers and options pricing models for positions that extend through 2007. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the fair value of MEGs trading assets combined with Emission Allowances it holds in escrow was $11 million and $38 million, respectively. The fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million at December 31, 2006 and $24 million at December 31, 2005. For 2006, MEG reflected a $10 million unrealized loss and a $10 million realized gain on its income statement, compared with an unrealized gain of $11 million and a realized loss of $11 million in the same period last year. For MEGs remaining trading contracts at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $1 million. Unrealized Gain (Loss) of MEGs Trading Activities Millions of Dollars Source of Fair Value At December 31, 2006 Maturity 0 6 months Maturity 6 12 months Maturity over 1 yr. Total Unrealized Gain (Loss) Prices actively quoted $ 4 $ 2 $ $ 6 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 3 3 Total $ 4 $ 5 $ $ 9 Credit Risk UniSource Energy is exposed to credit risk in its energy related marketing and trading activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. We manage the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standard agreement which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. We calculate counterparty credit exposure by adding any outstanding receivable (net of amounts payable if a netting agreement exists) to the mark to market value of any forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, TEPs total credit exposure related to its wholesale marketing and gas hedging activities was approximately $34 million. Approximately $2 million of TEPs exposure is to non investment grade companies. TEP had five counterparties with exposures of greater than 10% of its total credit exposure, totaling approximately $23 million. MEGs total credit exposure related to its trading activities was $5 million and was concentrated primarily with two counterparties. MEG has no credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties. UNS Gas is subject to credit risk from non performance by its supply counterparty, BP Energy (BP), to the extent that this contract has a mark to market value in favor of UNS Gas. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas K 75 Table of Contents has purchased under fixed price contracts approximately 48% of the expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March) and approximately 29% of its expected consumption for the 2007/2008 winter season. At December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had no credit exposure under its supply contract with BP. UNS Electric has begun to enter into energy purchase agreements to replace the full requirements contract it has with PWMT that expires in May 2008. To the extent that such contracts have a positive mark to market value, UNS Electric would be exposed to credit risk under those contracts. At December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had less than $1 million in credit exposure under such contracts.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Operations, for litigation related to ACC orders and retail competition. We discuss other legal proceedings in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. City of Tacoma In June 2004, the City of Tacoma, Washington filed a lawsuit (City of Tacoma v. American Electric Power Services Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Ct. W.D. Wash.)) against TEP and various other electricity generators and marketers alleging that the defendants violated antitrust laws by colluding to affect the price of electricity in the Pacific Northwest from May 2000 through 2001. In September 2004, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. TEP, along with other defendants, filed a joint motion to dismiss, which was granted on February 11, 2005. The City of Tacoma appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit and the appeal is now pending. TEP believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest them. ITEM 4.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. NON GAAP MEASURES Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change which is a non cash item. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is presented here as a measure of liquidity because it can be used as an indication of a companys ability to incur and service debt and is commonly used as an analytical indicator in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and we do not intend Adjusted EBITDA to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered to be an alternative to cash flows from operations or any other items calculated in accordance with GAAP or an indicator of our operating performance. UniSource Energy and TEP believe Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors as a measure of liquidity. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis explains the results of operations, the general financial condition, and the outlook for UniSource Energy and its three primary business segments and includes the following: outlook and strategies, operating results during 2006 compared with 2005, and 2005 compared with 2004, factors which affect our results and outlook, liquidity, capital needs, capital resources, and contractual obligations, dividends, and critical accounting estimates. UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns the outstanding common stock of TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. (UES), Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. (Millennium), and UniSource Energy Development Company (UED). TEP, an electric utility, has provided electric service to the community of Tucson, Arizona, for over 100 years. UES was established in 2003, when it acquired the Arizona gas and electric properties from Citizens. UES, through its two operating subsidiaries, UNS Gas, Inc. (UNS Gas) and UNS Electric, Inc. (UNS Electric), provides gas and electric service to 30 communities in Northern and Southern Arizona. Millennium has existing investments in unregulated businesses; however no new investments are planned at Millennium. UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS), a gas turbine project in Northern Arizona that, subject to approval, is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. We conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold its interest in Global Solar Energy, Inc. (Global Solar), its largest holding. At December 31, 2006, the investment in Millennium represented 3% of UniSource Energys Total Assets. UNISOURCE ENERGY CONSOLIDATED OUTLOOK AND STRATEGIES Our financial prospects and outlook for the next few years will be affected by many competitive, regulatory and economic factors. Our plans and strategies include the following: Efficiently manage our generation, transmission and distribution resources and seek ways to control our operating expenses while maintaining and enhancing reliability and profitability; Expand TEPs portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand and respond to wholesale market opportunities; Expand UNS Electrics portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand upon the expiration of the full requirements contract with PWMT; Resolve the uncertainty surrounding TEPs rates for generation service after 2008, while preserving TEPs benefits under the Settlement Agreement; Receive ACC approval of rate increases for UNS Gas and UNS Electric to provide adequate revenues to cover the rising cost of providing service to their customers; Enhance the value of existing generation assets by working with Salt River Project to support the construction of Springerville Unit 4; Enhance the value of TEPs transmission system while continuing to provide reliable access to generation for TEP and UNS Electrics retail customers and market access for all generating assets; K 29 Table of Contents Continue to develop synergies between UNS Gas,UNS Electric and TEP; Improve capital structure; and Promote economic development in our service territories. To accomplish our goals, during 2007 we expect to spend the following on capital expenditures: Segment Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 UNS Gas 38 UNS Electric 43 Other (1) 27 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 (1) Represents capital expenditures by UED related to the 90 MW BMGS to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, in UNS Electrics service area. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. While we believe that our plans and strategies will continue to have a positive impact on our financial prospects and position, we recognize that we continue to be highly leveraged, and as a result, our access to the capital markets may be limited or more expensive than for less leveraged companies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview UniSource Energy recorded Income Before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change of $69 million in 2006, $52 million in 2005 and $51 million in 2004. Net Income of $67 million in 2006 includes a $2 million loss from discontinued operations; net income of $46 million in 2005 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations and a $1 million loss from the cumulative effect of an accounting change; and net income of $46 million in 2004 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations. 2006 Compared With 2005 The improvement in UniSource Energys results in 2006 is due primarily to: the higher availability of TEPs coal fired generating plants; the start of commercial operations at Luna in April 2006; retail customer growth at TEP; interest savings related to various financing activities in 2005 and 2006; and the commencement of commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in August 2006. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below, and Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, below. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold Global Solar for $16 million in cash and an option to purchase, under certain conditions, 5% to 10% of Global Solar in the future. In 2006, UniSource Energy recorded an after tax loss of approximately $2 million related to the discontinued operations and disposal of Global Solar. See Other Non Reportable Segments, Results of Operations, Discontinued Operations Global Solar, below. 2005 Compared With 2004 UniSource Energys results in 2005 were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned outages at several of TEPs coal plants. One of TEPs largest coal plants suffered a nearly month long outage in August 2005, during a period when customer demand was high and energy prices were boosted by the impact of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher natural gas prices and the cost of purchasing replacement power during the outage contributed to an 82% increase in TEPs purchased power expense. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below. Also in 2005, UniSource Energy completed a financial restructuring, issuing $240 million of debt and using the proceeds to repay an inter company note and infuse capital into its subsidiaries. TEP retired approximately $321 million of debt and capital lease obligations (net of proceeds received from TEPs investment in lease debt).

Generally, cash from operations is lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. We use our available cash primarily to: fund capital expenditures at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric; pay dividends to shareholders; and reduce leverage. The primary source of liquidity for UniSource Energy, the parent company, is dividends it receives from its subsidiaries, primarily TEP. Also, under our tax sharing agreement, our subsidiaries make income tax payments to UniSource Energy, which makes payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The table below provides a summary of the liquidity position of UniSource Energy on a stand alone basis and each of its segments.

The matter is pending before the ACC. (2) Includes cash and cash equivalents at Millennium. Executive Overview Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities were $283 million or $9 million higher than 2005. The increase is due primarily to: an increase in TEPs cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs; higher UNS Gas retail revenues; and the wind down of activity at MEG; partially offset by a $32 million payment made to the IRS and state tax authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $76 million higher in 2006 primarily due to: TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease; growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; utility system growth at UNS Gas and UNS Electric; the purchase of two gas turbines by UED; and TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna. Forecasted Capital Expenditures Business Segment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 293 UNS Gas 38 33 27 28 26 UNS Electric 43 39 42 28 34 Other 27 10 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 $ 320 $ 264 $ 280 $ 353 Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $331 million, or 39% higher than forecasted amounts reported in 2006. This increase is the result of several factors including: higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; generation needs for UNS Electric; and continued strong customer growth in UniSource Energys utility service territories. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities were $36 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors impacting cash used for financing activities in 2006 include: an increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings and lower debt issuance costs; partially offset by an increase in net repayments of long term debt; higher payments on capital lease obligations by TEP; higher dividends paid by UniSource Energy to its shareholders. In 2005, UniSource Energy issued $240 million of debt, which it used to repay an inter company note to TEP and infuse K 32 Table of Contents capital into its subsidiaries. TEP used the proceeds from the inter company note repayment and capital infusion to retire $282 million of debt. As a result of the activities described above, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased to $104 million at December 31, 2006, from $145 million at December 31, 2005. We invest cash balances in high grade money market securities with an emphasis on preserving the principal amounts invested. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures at UniSource Energys subsidiaries, the revolving credit facilities at UniSource Energy, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may be used on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements of the strong utility customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt, as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy to its subsidiaries. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of rate related proceedings at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. For more information concerning liquidity and capital resources, see Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Other Non Reportable Segments, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. Convertible Senior Notes In March 2005, UniSource Energy issued $150 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, which are unsecured and are not guaranteed by TEP or any other UniSource Energy subsidiary. Each $1,000 of Convertible Senior Notes is convertible into 26.6667 shares of our Common Stock at any time, representing a conversion price of approximately $37.50 per share of our Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Beginning in March 2010, UniSource Energy will have the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, for cash, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the notes will have the right to require UniSource Energy to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, for cash on March 1, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or if certain specified fundamental changes involving UniSource Energy occur. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a fundamental change that occurs prior to March 2010, UniSource Energy may be required to pay a make whole premium on notes converted in connection with the fundamental change. The make whole premium will be payable in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock or the consideration into which UniSource Energy Common Stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with such fundamental change. A fundamental change involving UniSource Energy will be deemed to have occurred if: (1) certain transactions occur as a result of which there is a change in control of UniSource Energy; or (2) UniSource Energy Common Stock ceases to be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq National Market or another established automated over the counter trading market in the United States. The notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes. The failure to make required payments on the notes or comply with the terms of the indenture may constitute an event of default. In addition, events of default may arise upon the acceleration of $50 million of indebtedness for borrowed money of UniSource Energy or TEP, or certain events of bankruptcy involving UniSource Energy or TEP. UniSource Energy Credit Agreement In August 2006, UniSource Energy amended and restated its existing credit agreement (UniSource Credit Agreement). The amendment extended the maturity from April 2010 to August 2011, reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings, and changed the amounts available under the term loan and the revolving credit facilities. As amended, the UniSource Credit Agreement consists of a $30 million term loan facility and a $70 million revolving credit facility. Prior to the amendment, the UniSource Credit Agreement included a $90 million term loan facility ($84 million outstanding) and a $15 million revolving credit facility (zero outstanding). On August 11, 2006, UniSource Energy repaid the $84 million outstanding term loan with $30 million of available cash, $30 million drawn under the new term loan and $24 million drawn under the revolving credit facility. K 33 Table of Contents Quarterly principal payments of $1.5 million on the outstanding term loan are due beginning in September 2006, with the balance due at maturity. At December 31, 2006, there was $27 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $20 million outstanding under the UniSource Energy revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 6.67%. In January 2007, UniSource Energy repaid the $20 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. We have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 1.25% or the sum of the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate and 0.25%. The UniSource Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of assets, and certain investments and acquisitions. We must also meet: (1) a minimum cash flow to debt service coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a standalone basis and (2) a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. We may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, we have more than $15 million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving credit. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the terms of the UniSource Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the UniSource Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UniSource Credit Agreement, failure of UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million, or certain bankruptcy events at UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries. Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. We entered into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness of a subsidiary on a stand alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees at December 31, 2006 were: UES guarantee of $160 million of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas and UNS Electric to purchase the Citizens Arizona gas and electric system assets; UES guarantee of a $40 million revolving credit facility available to UNS Gas and UNS Electric; and UniSource Energys guarantee of approximately $5 million in natural gas and supply payments and building lease payments for UNS Gas and UNS Electric. To the extent liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have indemnified the purchasers of interests in certain investments from additional taxes due for years prior to the sale. The terms of the indemnifications provide for no limitation on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided by all tax laws and paid all tax obligations. We have not made any payments under the terms of these indemnifications to date. We believe that the likelihood that UniSource Energy would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. K 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following charts display UniSource Energys consolidated contractual obligations by maturity and by type of obligation as of December 31, 2006. UniSource Energys Contractual Obligations Millions of Dollars Payment Due in Years Ending December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and after Total Long Term Debt Principal(1) $ 6 $ 223 $ 6 $ 6 $ 382 $ 555 $ 1,178 Interest(2) 67 65 49 49 44 534 808 Capital Lease Obligations(3): Springerville Unit 1(4) 83 82 30 57 83 401 736 Springerville Coal Handling 24 18 15 17 19 101 194 Sundt Unit 4 12 12 13 14 51 Springerville Common 6 6 6 6 6 148 178 Operating Leases 2 2 2 2 1 2 11 Purchase Obligations(5): Coal and Rail Transportation(6) 89 89 80 80 42 242 622 Purchase Power(7) 3 27 36 24 15 16 121 Electric Generating Turbines 21 6 27 Transmission 7 2 1 1 1 12 Gas(8) 50 38 19 12 8 127 Other Long Term Liabilities(9): Pension & Other Post Retirement Obligations(10) 15 4 4 5 5 32 65 San Juan Pollution Control Equipment(11) 17 41 7 65 Acquisition of Springerville Coal Handling and Common Facilities(12) 226 226 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 402 $ 615 $ 268 $ 273 $ 606 $ 2,257 $ 4,421 (1) Includes quarterly principal payments due on the term loan facility in UniSource Energys Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the UNS Electric revolving credit facility. TEPs Variable Rate IDBs are backed by LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August 2011. Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022, the above maturity reflects a redemption or repurchase of such bonds in 2011 as though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit Agreement. (2) Includes letter of credit and remarketing fees on variable rate debt. The interest rates for variable rate debt are estimated using Eurodollar futures rates for an approximation of LIBOR. For variable rate IDBs, a discount is applied to estimated LIBOR based on the historical discount the IDBs have had to LIBOR. (3) Beginning with commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in September 2006, Tri State is reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the common facilities on an ongoing basis, including 14% of the Springerville Common Lease payments and 17% of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments. Similar reimbursement obligations are required after Unit 4 is constructed. TEP remains the obligor under these capital leases. Capital Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction associated with this reimbursement. (4) Annual payments under the Springerville Unit 1 lease vary in accordance with the amortization schedules of the debt underlying the capital lease, with significantly larger principal payments occurring in 2007, 2008 and 2011. (5) Purchase obligations reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. The total amount paid under these contracts depends on the quantity purchased and transported. TEP and UES requirements are expected to be in excess of K 35 Table of Contents these minimums. UniSource Energy has excluded open purchase orders of approximately $13 million expected to be fulfilled in 2007. (6) Based on prior years expenditures, TEP expects to spend approximately $200 million annually for the purchase and transportation of coal through 2010. TEP is unable to estimate how much it will spend under these contracts beyond 2010 due to the impact of the amended Springerville coal contract. (7) Includes TEP and UNS Electrics forward power purchases. TEP has not included capacity payments under TEPs purchased power agreement with Tri State which may be reduced in increments of 25 MW with 90 days notice. To date, TEP has received no such notice. If Tri State does not give notice to reduce capacity, the minimum capacity payments will be $31 million annually in 2007 through 2010 and $21 million in 2011. UniSource Energy also has not included amounts payable to PWMT under UNS Electrics full requirements power supply agreement as payments under this contract are usage based with no fixed demand charges and are recovered through the purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) mechanism. We expect to spend approximately $100 million annually under this contract through May 2008. (8) Amounts include UNS Gas fixed price forward gas purchases and firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern. Incremental gas purchases are excluded as prices and volumes vary. Amounts also exclude swap agreements which are marked to market on a monthly basis and do not include any minimum payment obligation. UNS Gas entered into forward gas purchases for 2007 through 2010 totaling $9 million subsequent to December 31, 2006, which are excluded from the table above. (9) Excludes TEPs liability for final environmental reclamation at the coal mines which supply the remote generating stations. TEP estimates its undiscounted final reclamation liability is $41 million with reclamation beginning in 2028. See Note 6. Also excludes asset retirement obligations expected to occur through 2066. See Note 3. Also, excludes Millenniums equity commitments totaling $1 million over two years to fund subsidiaries (Valley Ventures) as suitable investments are identified. (10) These obligations represent TEP and UES minimum required contributions to pension plans in 2007 and TEPs expected postretirement benefit costs to cover medical and life insurance claims as determined by the plans actuaries. TEP and UES do not know and have not included pension contributions beyond 2007 due to the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts. TEP funds the postretirement benefit plan on a pay as you go basis. (11) These obligations represent TEPs share of the cost of new pollution control equipment based on its ownership of San Juan. Under a settlement agreement signed in March 2005 with the New Mexico Environmental Department and environmental activist groups, the co owners of San Juan will install new technology at the generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx, and SO2 emissions. In addition, TEPs share of increased operating and maintenance costs associated with the new technologies is expected to be approximately $12 million over the next 10 years. (12) TEP has agreed with the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP is obligated to acquire the facilities at fixed prices of $120 million in 2015, $38 million in 2017, and $68 million in 2021. Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 17% and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: We do not have any provisions in any of our debt or lease agreements that would cause an event of default or cause amounts to become due and payable in the event of a credit rating downgrade. None of our contracts or financing structures contains provisions or acceleration clauses due to changes in our stock price. Dividends on Common Stock On February 9, 2007, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.225 per share on its Common Stock. The first quarter dividend, totaling approximately $8 million, will be paid March 14, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. During 2006, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.21 per share, totaling approximately $29 million. In 2005, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.19 per share, totaling approximately $26 million. Income Tax Position At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal and state income tax filing purposes, the following carryforward amounts: UniSource Energy TEP Amount Expiring Amount Expiring Millions of Dollars Year Millions of Dollars Year Capital Loss $ 37 2010 2011 $ AMT Credit 48 34 K 36 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Service Matters On its 2002 tax return, TEP filed for an automatic change in accounting method relating to the capitalization of indirect costs to the production of electricity and self constructed assets. The new accounting method was also used on the 2003 and 2004 returns for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. In August 2005, the IRS issued a ruling which draws into question the ability of electric and gas utilities to use the new accounting method. As a result, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have filed amended returns for 2002, 2003 and 2004 to remove the benefit previously claimed using the accounting method. In 2006, TEP and UNS Electric remitted tax and interest of $23 million and $1 million respectively to the IRS; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric remitted $8 million to state authorities. In December 2006, the IRS issued a final notice to the company disallowing the use of the accounting method. We are in the process of filing a protest and will proceed to appeals. TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial condition and results of operations of TEP are currently the principal factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of UniSource Energy on an annual basis. The following discussion relates to TEPs utility operations, unless otherwise noted. 2006 Compared With 2005 TEP recorded net income of $67 million in 2006 compared with $48 million in 2005. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2006 included: a $53 million increase in total operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather during the second quarter and retail customer growth; a $9 million increase in wholesale revenues due primarily to $3 million of transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in unrealized gains related to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Margins on wholesale sales were lower than last year due to a decline in the average market price for power; a $23 million increase in other revenues due primarily to fees and reimbursements received from Tri State for fuel and O&M costs related to Springerville Unit 3; a $24 million decrease in purchased power expense due to increased production at TEPs coal fired generating plants and the availability of Luna to offset some of the wholesale purchases to meet retail customer demand during peak summer periods. Purchased power expense also reflects a $4 million increase in unrealized losses due to mark to market adjustments on forward purchases of energy; offset by a $31 million increase in fuel expense due to increased generation at TEPs coal fired plants, gas related fuel expense at Luna and $8 million of fuel costs associated with Springerville Unit 3; a $31 million increase in O&M expense. TEPs O&M includes $9 million of expenses related to Springerville Unit 3. In addition, pre tax gains related to the sale of excess SO2 emission allowances were $7 million lower than 2005. Other factors contributing to higher O&M include operating expenses at Luna; generating plant maintenance; and higher payroll expenses; a $10 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and K 37 Table of Contents a $13 million decrease in total interest expense due primarily to lower interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations, which was partially offset by interest paid to the IRS related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and fees incurred in the third quarter of 2006 related to amending TEPs Credit Agreement. In 2006, the net pre tax benefit recognized by TEP related to Springerville Unit 3 for transmission revenues, operating fees and its share of the common costs was $8 million. 2005 Compared With 2004 TEP recorded income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $49 million in 2005 compared with $46 million in 2004. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2005 Included: a $26 million decrease in TEPs total operating revenue less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $60 million increase in TEPs purchased power expense resulting primarily from an extended unplanned outage of Springerville Unit 2 in August 2005, planned maintenance outages at San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 during the second quarter and higher wholesale power prices; a $14 million increase in TEPs fuel expense due to a $3 million increase in natural gas costs primarily from higher gas prices and an $11 million increase in coal costs; a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather and a 3% increase in TEPs customer base; and a $19 million increase in TEPs wholesale revenues due to higher market prices for power compared to last year. a $22 million decrease in O&M. Higher maintenance costs at TEPs coal fired plants were offset by an increase of $10 million in pre tax gains on the sale of excess SO2 Emission Allowances by TEP; a $6 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and a $17 million decrease in total interest expense related to the financial restructuring of TEP in May 2005. 2004 Included: expenses of $8 million related to a proposed but terminated acquisition of UniSource Energy. Utility Sales and Revenues Customer growth, weather and other consumption factors affect retail sales of electricity. Electric wholesale revenues are affected by market prices in the wholesale energy market, the availability of TEP generating resources, and the level of wholesale forward contract activity. K 38 Table of Contents The table below provides trend information on retail sales by major customer class and electric wholesale sales made by TEP in the last three years as well as weather data for TEPs service territory.

Wholesale revenues increased $9 million in 2006 compared with last year. In 2006, wholesale revenues included $3 million in transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in net unrealized gain due to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Wholesale kWh sales increased 8% primarily due to the higher availability of TEPs coal plants; however, margins on wholesale sales were lower due to a 16% decrease in the average market price of wholesale energy. TEPs margins on wholesale sales were higher in 2005, as hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico boosted market prices for wholesale energy in the last six months of the year. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Mark to Market Adjustments on Trading Activity The table below summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) on TEPs forward sales and purchases of energy. Net unrealized gains (losses) on forward sales of energy are presented on the income statement in wholesale revenues. Net unrealized gains (losses) on forward purchases of energy are presented on the income statement in purchased power expense.

Residential kWh sales increased 5% and commercial kWh sales increased 4% during 2005. Despite lower coal plant availability and a 3% decrease in wholesale kWh sales, wholesale revenues increased $18 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared with 2004. The average wholesale market price of energy was $59 per MWh in 2005, compared with $44 per MWh in 2004. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Operating Expenses 2006 Compared with 2005 Fuel and Purchased Power TEPs fuel and purchased power expense, and energy resources for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are detailed below: Generation Expense 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of kWh Millions of Dollars Coal Fired Generation Four Corners 812 783 749 $ 12 $ 11 $ 10 Navajo 1,215 1,221 1,244 17 16 15 San Juan 2,486 2,484 2,435 56 53 48 Springerville 5,826 5,572 5,731 96 94 92 Sundt 4 623 787 735 14 16 14 Total Coal Fired Generation 10,962 10,847 10,894 $ 195 $ 190 $ 179 Gas Fired Generation Luna 516 24 Other Units 334 368 432 31 36 34 Total Gas Fired Generation 850 368 432 55 36 34 Solar and Other Generation 9 9 8 Total Generation (1) 11,821 11,224 11,334 250 226 213 Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 103 131 73 Net Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Forward Purchases of Energy 6 2 Total Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 109 133 73 Total Resources 13,528 12,863 12,656 $ 359 $ 359 $ 286 Less Line Losses and Company Use 886 806 821 Total Energy Sold 12,642 12,057 11,835 (1) Fuel expense in 2006 excludes $8 million related to Springerville Unit 3; the fuel costs incurred on behalf of Unit 3 are recorded in Fuel Expense and the reimbursement by Tri State is recorded in Other Revenue. The start of commercial operation of Luna and higher coal plant availability in the summer months led to a $24 million increase in fuel expense in 2006 (excluding fuel expenses at Springerville Unit 3); however, purchased power expense decreased $24 million as these same factors reduced TEPs need to purchase power during the summer months to meet retail demand. Gas fired generation more than doubled in 2006, causing gas related fuel expense to increase $19 million, or 53%. Coal fired generation increased 1%, leading to a $5 million increase in coal related fuel expense. Lunas generation output reported in the table above includes energy generated during its test phase, but does not include any associated fuel costs which were capitalized and reported as project costs. Despite a 4% increase in purchased energy volumes, purchased power expense was $24 million, or 18%, lower due to a decrease in average wholesale energy prices in 2006 as well as fewer short term purchases during the summer months when market prices for wholesale energy are typically higher. In September 2006, TEP began purchasing energy from Tri State under a 100 MW purchased power agreement. The table below shows TEPs average resource cost per kWh generated: K 40 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 cents per kWh Coal 1.78 1.75 1.64 Gas 6.69 9.78 7.87 All sources 2.61 2.01 1.88 *In 2006, the average cost of gas generation per kWh excludes test energy produced at Luna and its associated fuel costs. TRA amortization increased $10 million in 2006. Amortization of the TRA is the result of the Settlement Agreement with the ACC, which changed the accounting method for TEPs generation operations. This item reflects the recovery, through 2008, of transition recovery assets which were previously regulatory assets of the generation business. The amount of amortization is a function of the TRA balance and total kWh consumption by TEPs distribution customers. The table below shows estimated annual TRA amortization and unamortized TRA year end balances for 2007 and 2008. Estimated Unamortized TRA Amortization TRA Balance Millions of Dollars 2007 76 26 2008 26 Other Income (Deductions) In 2005, TEPs Income Statement included inter company Interest Income of $2 million. This represented Interest Income on a promissory note TEP received from UniSource Energy in exchange for the transfer to UniSource Energy of its stock in Millennium in 1998. UniSource Energy repaid the inter company promissory note on March 1, 2005. On UniSource Energys Consolidated Statement of Income, this Interest Income, as well as UniSource Energys related interest expense, was eliminated as an inter company transaction. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, TEP Cash Flows, Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy, below. Operating Expenses 2005 Compared with 2004 Fuel and Purchased Power During 2005, planned outages at Springerville Unit 2, San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 and an extended unplanned outage at Springerville Unit 2 during the third quarter led to higher gas related fuel costs and an 82% increase in purchased power expense. Purchased power expense increased $60 million compared with 2004, due to a 19% increase in MWhs purchased and an increase in wholesale market prices for power. The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Palo Verde Index increased 34% in 2005 compared with average prices in 2004. A combination of higher coal and natural gas costs contributed to a $13 million increase in total fuel expense at TEPs generating plants in 2005. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change TEP adopted FIN 47 in December 2005 and recorded a one time $1 million after tax cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and Critical Accounting Estimates, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, below. K 41 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Competition In 2001, all of TEPs retail customers became eligible to choose an alternative energy service provider (ESP), however, only a small number of commercial and industrial customers initially chose an ESP. By 2002, none of TEPs retail customers were served by an alternative ESP. In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. In February 2006, the ACC Staff requested that a proceeding be opened to address the issue of retail electric competition. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules. TEP has met all conditions required by the ACC to facilitate electric retail competition, including ACC approval of TEPs direct access tariffs. See Rates, ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement, below. TEP competes against gas service suppliers and others that provide energy services. Other forms of energy technologies may provide competition to TEPs services in the future, but to date, are generally not financially viable alternatives for its retail customers. Self generation by TEPs large industrial customers could also provide competition for TEPs services in the future, but has not had a significant impact to date. In the wholesale market, TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy. ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement Beginning in May 2005, TEP filed a series of pleadings requesting the ACC to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the methodology that will be applied to determine TEPs rates for generation service after 2008. TEP filed the pleadings in response to the Arizona Court of Appeals ruling related to retail competition and market pricing and a lack of agreement as to the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement by a number of participants in TEPs rate proceedings. TEP believes that the Settlement Agreement contemplated market based rates for generation service after 2008. See Competition, above for information regarding the recent court ruling. In April 2006, the ACC ordered that a procedure be established to allow for an expeditious and complete review of, among other things, the Settlement Agreement and its effect on how TEPs rates for generation services will be determined after December 31, 2008. The testimony filed by a number of participants in this proceeding, including the ACC Staff and Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO), reflect differing interpretations of the Settlement Agreement and a belief that TEP is required to charge cost of service rates for generation service in 2009. According to testimony filed by TEP, its average retail rate would increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. TEP also proposed two alternatives to charging market based rates for generation in 2009: a market phase in proposal with an initial rate increase capped at 12%; and a cost of service (including an $850 million regulatory asset and energy cost adjustment clause) proposal that would increase average retail rates in 2009 approximately 26% over current rates. See TEP Testimony, The Market Phase in Proposal, and The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal, below for more information. In February 2007, parties in this proceeding participated in settlement discussions, however were unable to reach a settlement. A public hearing before an ACC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) is scheduled to begin on March 6, 2007. Following the public hearing, the ALJ will propose a recommended opinion and order for consideration by the ACC. We expect the ALJ to issue a recommendation in the second quarter of 2007. If the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement allowing TEP to charge market based rates for generation service in 2009 and orders TEP to return to cost of service generation rates without compensating TEP for financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, TEP will file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages. K 42 Table of Contents Rates Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Rules that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. The Rules and the Settlement Agreement established: a period from November 1999 through 2008 for TEP to transition its generation assets from a cost of service based rate structure to a market, or competitive, rate structure; the recovery through rates during the transition period of $450 million of stranded generation costs through a fixed competitive transition charge (Fixed CTC); capped rates for TEP retail customers through 2008; an ACC interim review of TEP retail rates in 2004; unbundling of electric services with separate rates or prices for generation, transmission, distribution, metering, meter reading, billing and collection, and ancillary services; a process for ESPs to become licensed by the ACC to sell generation services at market prices to TEP retail customers; access for TEP retail customers to buy market priced generation services from ESPs beginning in 2000 (currently, no TEP customers are purchasing generation services from ESPs); transmission and distribution services would remain subject to regulation on a cost of service basis; and beginning in 2009, TEPs generation would be market based and its retail customers would pay the market rate for generation services. Track A and Track B Proceedings During 2002 and 2003, the ACC reexamined circumstances that had changed since it approved the Rules in 1999. The outstanding issues were divided into two groups. Track A related primarily to the divestiture of generation assets while Track B related primarily to the competitive energy bidding process. Under the ACCs Rules, TEP and other utilities were required to divest their generation assets. TEP later requested a waiver of the divestiture requirement. The Track A order granted TEPs request and eliminated the divesture requirement. As a result, generation assets remain at TEP. At the same time, the ACC ordered the parties, including TEP, to develop a competitive bidding process and reduced the minimum amount of power to be acquired in the competitive bidding process to only that portion not supplied by TEPs existing resources. The ACC Track B order defined the competitive bidding process TEP must use to obtain capacity and energy requirements. The Track B order did not address TEPs purchased power or asset acquisitions occurring subsequent to the 2003 competitive solicitation. 2004 General Rate Case Information In June 2004, as required by the Settlement Agreement, TEP filed general rate case information with the ACC. TEPs filing did not propose any change in retail rates and, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no rate case filed by TEP through 2008 may result in a net rate increase. However, absent the restriction on raising rates, TEP believes that the data in its filing would have justified an increase in retail rates of 16%. The general rate case information used a historical test year ended December 31, 2003 and established, based on TEPs standard offer service, that TEP was experiencing a revenue deficiency of $111 million. None of the intervenor testimony filed proposed any decrease to TEPs rates. Testimony filed by the ACC Staff, Residential Utility Consumer Office and Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition indicated revenue deficiencies for TEP of $67 million, $32 million and $38 million, respectively. In 2005, the ALJ issued a procedural order suspending the remaining testimony filing deadlines and hearing in the 2004 rate review. K 43 Table of Contents TEP Testimony In August 2006, TEP filed testimony in the ACC proceedings to review the Settlement Agreement. TEPs testimony states its belief that it is entitled to charge market based generation service rates in 2009 and has complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. TEP testimony states that the Settlement Agreement provided the terms and conditions by which TEP is to transition into the competitive electric marketplace. The rate impact of charging market based generation service rates in 2009 would vary with market conditions which are influenced by the cost of natural gas. Assuming a natural gas cost of $7 per MMBtu, which equates to a wholesale power price of approximately $60 per MWh, TEPs average retail rate would be expected to increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. The Settlement Agreement required TEP to significantly change the way it conducted business. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, TEP agreed to: (i) rate reductions in 1999 and 2000; (ii) a rate freeze from July 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008, taking all the risk of inflation and cost increases; (iii) unbundled tariffed rates; (iv) accelerate depreciation of certain generation related assets; (v) offset the standard offer generation rate (Market Generation Credit) by the amount of the Floating Competition Transition Charge; (vi) open its exclusive service territory to competition for generation service; (vii) assume the volatility and risk of market rates in 2009; and (viii) a rate check in 2004 when rates could not increase but could actually decrease. In the testimony, TEP states that if the ACC or other parties to the Settlement Agreement seek to unilaterally change the contract and order TEP back to cost of service, which is a breach that will force TEP to protect its rights in court and seek an order, which may include an award for damages. TEP states that, if the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement, does not agree to one of TEPs alternative proposals, and orders that TEPs generation service rates will be based on traditional cost of service ratemaking without compensating TEP for the financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, then TEP must: (1) file a rate case and (2) immediately file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages arising from the ACCs breach of the Settlement Agreement. TEP states that the financial impacts and costs directly attributable to the Settlement Agreement exceed $850 million. In the testimony, TEP offered alternatives to charging market based generation service rates after December 31, 2008, as described below. The Market Phase In Proposal TEP proposed a market rate phase in plan in the event that the ACC desires to maintain a competitive wholesale generation market, but wants to mitigate the immediate impact of market rates. Elements of the market rate phase in include: A cap would be set such that no customer class would realize an initial rate increase in excess of 12%. The phase in period would begin in 2009, last approximately four years and then be fully market based; TEPs current rates would remain frozen through the end of 2008; and Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs. The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal TEPs cost of service proposal presents a framework for returning TEP to cost of service regulation for generation service if the ACC determines that it will abandon the concept of a competitive wholesale and retail generation market. Elements of the proposal include: A new regulatory asset of $850 million to be included in rate base will be created to compensate TEP for the financial impacts and costs incurred in performing under the Settlement Agreement; An energy cost adjustment clause (ECAC) to recover energy costs associated with serving the incremental retail load above that filed in its cost of service test year; Immediate filing of a cost of service rate case in 2007; K 44 Table of Contents Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs; and Restore exclusivity of TEPs certificate of convenience and necessity. The proposed ECAC would differ from some other purchase power and fuel clauses in that it would not include any fuel or purchased power price risks or plant operating risks associated with serving the test year portion of TEPs retail load. Also, the ECAC would not be a straight pass through of purchased power costs to serve the incremental load. In the event that TEPs actual fuel and purchased power costs related to the incremental load exceeds the ECAC rate, TEP would not be able to pass the excess costs through to customers. However, in the event that those costs are less than the ECAC rate, TEP would be entitled to retain those earnings. If the ACC adopts TEPs cost of service proposal and approves a new regulatory asset of $850 million and implementation of the ECAC mechanism, TEP expects that its average retail rate in 2009 would increase by approximately 26% over current rates. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate or purchase at least 15% of their total annual retail energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025, with smaller amounts required in earlier years starting when the REST tariff submitted by an affected utility is approved by the ACC. To provide an opportunity for full recovery of the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the adopted REST rules allow for a new tariff to be implemented separate and apart from the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. The rules require affected utilities to annually file with the ACC a REST tariff request with a REST implementation plan to recover the cost of purchasing or installing and operating the renewable resources. The tariff amount is annually subject to ACC approval. The REST rules require utilities to file annual compliance reports outlining the results of the renewable programs implemented the prior year, highlighting steps they are taking to meet the REST annual renewable energy requirements. The REST rules adopted by the ACC must be certified by the Arizona Attorney General before taking effect. As of February 23, 2007, the Attorney General had not issued an opinion certifying the REST rules. Western Energy Markets As a participant in the Western U.S. wholesale power markets, TEP is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions and market participants. TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy at market based rates in the wholesale market. At the end of 2006, electric generating capacity in Arizona was approximately 25,600 MW, an increase of 61% since 2001. A majority of the growth is the result of 17 new or upgraded gas fired generating units with a combined capacity of approximately 9,700 MW. The completion of Springerville Unit 3 in 2006 provided 400 MW of new coal fired generation located in Arizona. Market Prices The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index decreased in 2006, as did the average price for natural gas based on the Permian Index. We cannot predict whether changes in various factors that influence demand and supply will cause prices to change during 2007. K 45 Table of Contents Average Market Price for Around the Clock Energy $/MWh Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 48 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 78 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 50 Year ended December 31, 2005 59 Average Market Price for Natural Gas $/MMBtu Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 5.58 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 9.67 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 6.05 Year ended December 31, 2005 7.17 In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel and gas indexed purchased power with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP currently has approximately 35% of this exposure hedged for the summer peak period of 2007 (June September) at a weighted average price of $7.18 per MMBtu. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. Market prices may also affect TEPs wholesale revenues. TEP commits to future sales of energy as part of its ongoing efforts to hedge its excess generation based on projected generation capability, forward prices and generation costs. For the first quarter of 2007, TEP has sold forward approximately 255,000 MWh at an average price of $70 per MWh, which excludes on peak hours in April through September. We expect the market price and demand for capacity and energy to continue to be influenced by factors including: availability and price of natural gas; weather; continued population growth in the Western U.S.; economic conditions in the Western U.S.; availability of generating capacity throughout the Western U.S.; the extent of electric utility industry restructuring in Arizona, California and other Western states; FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets; availability of hydropower; transmission constraints; and environmental regulations and the cost of compliance. Coal Supply On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The cost of coal and transportation under the agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. Based on these agreements, and increases at other coal fired plants, we expect TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants to increase by approximately $17 million, or 9% in 2007. Emission Allowances TEP has SO2 Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to operate its generating units. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. From time to time, TEP will sell a portion of its excess SO2 Emission Allowances. The table below summarizes sales made in 2005 and 2006, and forward sales of SO2 Emission Allowances, as of December 31, 2006. K 46 Table of Contents Delivery Allowances Sold Pre tax Gain (millions) 2005 15,000 $13 2006 10,000 7 2007 10,000 8 In addition to the allowances contracted to be sold in 2007, TEP expects to have approximately 20,000 excess SO2 Emission Allowances through 2009. Springerville Units 3 and 4 Springerville Unit 3, which commenced commercial operation in July 2006, is a 400 MW coal fired generating facility located at the same site as Springerville Units 1 and 2. Tri State is leasing 100% of Unit 3 from a financial owner. TEP allocates a portion of the fixed costs of the existing common facilities to the additional generating unit. TEP operates Unit 3 and will receive annual pre tax benefits of approximately $15 million in the form of transmission revenues, rental payments and other fees and cost savings. As part of the project, Tri State provided funding to improve sulfur dioxide scrubbers, low nitrogen oxide burners and other emission control upgrades for Units 1 and 2, which were completed in 2005. SRP is purchasing 100 MW of capacity from Tri State under a 30 year power purchase agreement. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired generating facility at the same Springerville site. Construction of Unit 4 has begun and, under the terms of existing regulatory permits, is required to be completed by December 31, 2009. Prior to Unit 4s completion, TEP may be required, along with Tri State, to exercise best efforts to find a replacement purchaser for SRP to purchase 100 MW of capacity from Unit 3. If TEP and Tri State are unable to find such a replacement purchaser, TEP would then purchase 100 MW of output from Unit 4, beginning with the commercial operation of Unit 4. Given the current level of wholesale power market prices, we believe it is unlikely that TEP would be required to find a replacement purchaser or to purchase SRPs 100 MW. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TEP Cash Flows During 2007, TEP expects to generate sufficient internal cash flows to fund most of its construction expenditures as well as its operating activities, required debt maturities and dividends to UniSource Energy. Cash flows may vary during the year, with cash flow from operations typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. As a result of the varied seasonal cash flow, TEP will use, as needed, its revolving credit facility to fund its business activities. The table below shows the cash available to TEP after capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and payments on capital lease obligations: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Capital Expenditures (156 ) (150 ) (129 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Scheduled Repayments of Long Term Debt (2 ) Less: Retirement of Capital Lease Obligations (61 ) (53 ) (49 ) Plus: Proceeds from Investment in Lease Debt 22 14 12 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* $ 32 $ 54 $ 107 K 47 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Net Cash Flows Investing Activities (GAAP) (182 ) (129 ) (126 ) Net Cash Flows Financing Activities (GAAP) (79 ) (174 ) (101 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* 32 54 107 * Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments, both non GAAP measures of liquidity, should not be considered as alternatives to Net Cash Flows Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity. We believe that Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments provide useful information to investors as measures of liquidity and our ability to fund our capital requirements, make required payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and pay dividends to UniSource Energy. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures, TEP may use its revolving credit facility on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements from TEPs strong customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of TEPs rate related proceedings. Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities decreased by $16 million compared with the same period in 2005. Net cash flows were impacted by: 2006 included: a $28 million increase in cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs, due primarily to retail customer growth, higher availability of excess power to sell into the wholesale market; and the availability of Luna to offset some of TEPs purchased power requirements; and a $16 million decrease in total interest paid due to lower capital lease obligation balances, lower long term debt balances and lower annual fees under the TEP credit agreement that was entered into in May 2005 and amended in August 2006; a $20 million increase in other cash receipts due primarily to payments from Tri State for fees and the reimbursement of operating costs related to Springerville Unit 3; offset by a $42 million increase in income taxes paid due to a $31 million payment made to the IRS and state authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments; an $11 million increase in O&M costs due primarily to operating costs at Luna and higher generating plant maintenance costs; an $8 million decline in proceeds from the sale of excess emission allowances; a $4 million increase in taxes other than income taxes; and a $3 million increase in wages paid. 2005 included: $11 million of interest received from UniSource Energy related to an inter company note repaid in the first quarter of 2005. K 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $53 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to: a $9 million increase in proceeds from investments in Springerville Lease Debt; offset by a $6 million increase in capital expenditures related to TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna and growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; and TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease, which represents approximately 53 MW of capacity. Capital Expenditures TEPs forecasted capital expenditures are summarized below: Category 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars Transmission, Distribution and Other Facilities $ 144 $ 149 $ 120 $ 183 $ 184 Generation Facilities 36 47 67 33 98 Environmental 18 42 8 8 10 Total $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 292 Capital expenditures for TEP of $855 million for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $216 million, or 34% higher than our 2005 forecast. This increase is the result of several factors including: strong customer growth; higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; the reinforcement and expansion of distribution lines; and environmental upgrades to generating facilities. These estimated expenditures include costs for TEP to comply with current federal and state environmental regulations. These estimates do not include the costs to construct the proposed Tucson to Nogales, Arizona transmission line. All of these estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual construction expenditures may be different from these estimates due to changes in business conditions, construction schedules, environmental requirements, and changes to TEPs business arising from retail competition. TEP plans to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash flow. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line If all regulatory approvals are received, the future costs to construct the transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona is expected to be approximately $95 million. Through December 31, 2006, approximately $11 million in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses have been incurred on this project. If the required approvals are not received, TEP may be required to expense a portion of the costs that have been capitalized related to the project, propose alternative methods to the ACC for improving reliability and spend additional amounts to implement such alternatives. See Item 1. Business, Tucson Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. In addition to TEPs forecasted capital expenditures for construction, TEPs other capital requirements include its required debt maturities and capital lease obligations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities, and Capital Lease Obligations. Investments in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity At December 31, 2006, TEP had $181 million of investments in lease debt and equity on its balance sheet. The yields on TEPs investments in Springerville Lease Debt, at the date of purchase, range from 8.9% to 12.7%. The table below provides a summary of the investment balances in lease debt. K 49 Table of Contents Lease Debt Investment Balance Leased Asset December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 In Millions Investments in Lease Debt: Springerville Unit 1 $ 81 $ 91 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 52 65 Total Investment in Lease Debt $ 133 $ 156 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $95 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. The following factors contributed to the decrease: 2006 included: a $30 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility; offset by a $16 million increase in dividends paid to UniSource Energy; and an $8 million increase in scheduled payments made on capital lease obligations. 2005 included: a $110 million equity investment by UniSource Energy; and $95 million from UniSource Energy as a repayment for an inter company loan; offset by $282 million to repay long term debt; $5 million for debt issuance and retirement costs. At December 31, 2006, there were $30 million in outstanding borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility. TEP Credit Agreement In August 2006, TEP amended and restated its existing credit agreement (TEP Credit Agreement). The amendment reduced the interest rate and fees payable on TEPs borrowings and letters of credit, increased the amount of its revolving credit facility to $150 million from $60 million, and extended the maturity to August 2011 from May 2010. In addition to the revolving credit facility, the TEP Credit Agreement includes a $341 million letter of credit facility which supports $329 million of tax exempt variable rate bonds. The TEP Credit Agreement is secured by $491 million of 1992 Mortgage Bonds. Interest rates and fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 0.55% per annum and amounts drawn under a letter of credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum. TEP has the option of paying interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 0.55% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The TEP Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and sale leaseback agreements. The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP to meet a minimum cash coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement, it may pay dividends to UniSource Energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the TEP Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the TEP Credit Agreement; change in control, as defined; failure of TEP or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million; or certain bankruptcy events at TEP or certain subsidiaries. K 50 Table of Contents Springerville Common Facilities Leases In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one half ownership interest in the common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station. TEP refinanced the lease debt totaling $68 million in June 2006. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The refinancing had no impact on the Springerville Common Facilities capital lease obligation or asset. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. The LIBOR rate in effect on December 31, 2006 was 5.63%, and 3.68% on December 31, 2005, which resulted in a total interest rate on the lease debt of 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy In March 2005, UniSource Energy repaid to TEP a debt obligation in the principal amount of $95 million plus accrued interest of $11 million. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Capital Contribution from UniSource Energy In May 2005, UniSource Energy made a $110 million capital contribution to TEP. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Bond Repurchases and Redemptions TEP made a sinking fund payment of $1 million on its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs in January 2005. In March 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $31 million of its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2008, as well as the remaining $21 million of its 7.5% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2006. In May 2005, TEP used the proceeds from the repayment of the note from UniSource Energy and the capital contribution from UniSource Energy to purchase $147 million of its 1997 Pima Series B and $74 million of its 1997 Pima Series C fixed rate tax exempt bonds (Repurchased Bonds) at a price of $101.50 per $100 principal amount. In May 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $4 million of bonds outstanding under those series. TEP does not currently plan on canceling the Repurchased Bonds, which will remain outstanding under their respective indentures; however, the Repurchased Bonds will not be presented in our financial statements. TEP may choose to resell the Repurchased Bonds to third parties or cancel them in the future. Mortgage Indentures In June 2005, TEP terminated its 1941 Mortgage (formerly known as its First Mortgage). TEPs remaining mortgage is its 1992 Mortgage (formerly known as its Second Mortgage). TEPs mortgage indenture creates a lien on and security interest in most of TEPs utility plant assets. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos, is not subject to this lien and security interest. TEPs mortgage indenture allows TEP to issue additional mortgage bonds on the basis of (1) a percentage of net utility property additions and or (2) the principal amount of retired mortgage bonds. The amount of bonds that TEP may issue is also subject to a net earnings test under the indenture. TEPs Credit Agreement, which totals $491 million and is secured by 1992 Mortgage Bonds, limits the amount of mortgage bonds that may be outstanding to no more than $840 million. At December 31, 2006, TEP had a total of $629 million in outstanding mortgage bonds, consisting of $491 million in bonds securing the TEP Credit Agreement, and $138 million in bonds securing the 7.50% Collateral Trust Bonds due in 2008. Although the 1992 Mortgage would allow TEP to issue additional bonds, the limit imposed by the TEP Credit Agreement is more restrictive and is currently the governing limitation. K 51 Table of Contents Tax Exempt Local Furnishing Bonds TEP has financed a substantial portion of utility plant assets with industrial development revenue bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authorities of Pima County and Apache County. The interest on these bonds is excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal tax purposes. This exclusion is allowed because the facilities qualify as facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. These bonds are sometimes referred to as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. To qualify for this exclusion, the facilities must be part of a system providing electric service to customers within not more than two contiguous counties. TEP provides electric service to retail customers in the City of Tucson and certain other portions of Pima County, Arizona and to Fort Huachuca in contiguous Cochise County, Arizona. TEP has financed the following facilities, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of tax exempt local furnishing bonds: Springerville Unit 2, Sundt Unit 4, a dedicated 345 kV transmission line from Springerville Unit 2 to TEPs retail service area (the Express Line), and a portion of TEPs local transmission and distribution system in the Tucson metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had approximately $359 million of tax exempt local furnishing bonds outstanding. Approximately $257 million in principal amount of such bonds financed Springerville Unit 2 and the Express Line. In addition, approximately $38 million of remaining lease debt related to the Sundt Unit 4 lease obligation was issued as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. Various events might cause TEP to have to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds: formation of an RTO or ISO; asset divestiture; changes in tax laws; or changes in system operations. TEP believes that its qualification as a local furnishing system should not be lost so long as (1) the RTO or ISO would not change the operation of the Express Line or the transmission facilities within TEPs local service area, (2) the RTO or ISO allows pricing of transmission service such that the benefits of tax exempt financing continue to accrue to retail customers, and (3) energy produced by Springerville Unit 2 and TEPs local generating units continues to be consumed in TEPs local service area. However, there is no assurance that such qualification can be maintained. Any redemption or defeasance of these bonds would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater amount. Capital Lease Obligations At December 31, 2006, TEP had $647 million of total capital lease obligations on its balance sheet. The table below provides a summary of the outstanding lease amounts in each of the obligations. Leased Asset Capital Lease Obligation Balance at December 31, 2006 Expiration In Millions Springerville Unit 1 $381 2015 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 112 2015 Springerville Common Facilities 107 2020 Sundt Unit 4 46 2011 Other Leases 1 2008 Total Capital Lease Obligations $647 Except for TEPs 14% equity ownership in the Springerville Unit 1 Leases and its 13% equity ownership in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, TEP will not own these assets at the expiration of the leases. TEP may renew the leases or purchase the leased assets at such time. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, while the purchase price option is fixed for the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Facilities. See UniSource Energy, Contractual Obligations, footnote (3), for more information about the fixed purchase price amounts.

We have no other commercial commitments to report. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: TEPs Credit Agreement contains pricing for its Revolving Credit Facility based on TEPs credit ratings. A change in TEPs credit ratings can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of interest TEP pays on its borrowings. TEPs Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including interest coverage and leverage tests. Failure to comply with these covenants would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with these covenants. See TEP Credit Agreement, above. TEP conducts its wholesale marketing and risk management activities under certain master agreements whereby TEP may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values, a change in TEPs credit ratings or if there has been a material change in TEPs creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, TEP has not been required to post such credit enhancement. Dividends on Common Stock TEP declared and paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $62 million in 2006, $46 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. TEP can pay dividends if it maintains compliance with the TEP Credit Agreement and certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. K 53 Table of Contents The Federal Power Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital accounts. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe that there is a reasonable basis to pay dividends from current year earnings. UNS GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UniSource Energy formed two operating companies, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, to acquire the Arizona electric and gas assets from Citizens in 2003, as well as an intermediate holding company, UES, to hold the common stock of UNS Gas and UNS Electric. UNS Gas reported net income of $4 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $6 million in 2004. We expect operations at UNS Gas to vary with the seasons, with peak energy usage occurring in the winter months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had approximately 145,000 retail customers, a 5% increase from last year. The table below shows UNS Gas therm sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Sales Revenues 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Therms Millions of Dollars Retail Therm Sales: Residential 70 69 71 $ 96 $ 79 $ 76 Commercial 30 29 29 38 29 28 Industrial 3 3 3 3 2 2 Public Authorities 7 7 7 8 7 6 Total Retail Therm Sales 110 108 110 145 117 112 Transport 23 27 3 3 3 Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) 17 21 21 12 16 12 Total Therm Sales 150 156 131 $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Through a Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) approved by the ACC, UNS Gas supplies natural gas to some of its large transportation customers. Approximately one half of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas while the remainder benefits retail customers through a credit to the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. The table below provides summary financial information for UNS Gas. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Gas Revenues $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Other Revenues 2 2 2 Total Operating Revenues 162 138 129 Purchased Energy Expense 114 91 82 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 25 23 23 Depreciation and Amortization 7 7 5 Taxes other than Income Taxes 3 3 3 Total Other Operating Expenses 149 124 113 Operating Income 13 14 16 Total Other Income 1 Total Interest Expense 7 6 6 Income Tax Expense 3 3 4 Net Income $ 4 $ 5 $ 6 K 54 Table of Contents Retail therm sales were 2% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. In 2006, retail revenues increased $24 million and purchased energy expense increased $23 million, due primarily to the PGA surcharge increase, which became effective in November 2005. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation Energy, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Gas retail rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism. The PGA mechanism has two components, the PGA factor and the PGA surcharge or credit. The PGA factor is a mechanism that compares the twelve month rolling weighted average gas cost to the base cost of gas, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve month period. The actual gas and transportation costs that are either under or over collected through the base rate of $0.40 per therm or $4.00 per MMBtu and the PGA factor are charged or credited to a balancing account (PGA bank). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the average PGA factor was approximately $0.33 per therm or $3.33 per MMBtu. The current annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor is $0.10 per therm in a twelve month period. As part of its general rate case proceeding with the ACC, UNS Gas requested to remove the cap to allow for more timely recovery of actual gas costs. See General Rate Case Filing, below. When the ACC designated under or over recovery trigger points of $6.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge or credit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred from or to customers over a period deemed appropriate by the ACC. On December 31, 2006, the PGA bank balance was over collected by $2 million on the basis as billed to customers. In December 2006, the ACC approved a proposal by UNS Gas that lowered the PGA surcharge to $0.05 per therm. The $0.05 per therm PGA surcharge will remain in effect through April 2007. Based on current projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the lower surcharge amount will allow it to timely recover its gas costs and still provide rate relief to its customers. Changes in the market price for gas, sales volumes and surcharge amount could significantly change the PGA bank balance in the future. General Rate Case Filing UNS Gas current rates have been in place since August 2003 and were designed to provide a 9.05% return on original cost rate base of $118 million. As a result of increased growth in UNS Gas service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Gas to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Gas request: Test year Year ended December 31, 2005 Original cost rate base $162 million Revenue deficiency $10 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 7% Cost of debt 6.60% Cost of equity 11.00% Hypothetical capital structure 50% equity / 50% debt Weighted average cost of capital 8.80% K 55 Table of Contents UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices, inappropriate price signals to customers and the potential for over or under collections to result in the accumulation of large bank balances. In February 2007, ACC staff filed testimony that indicated a revenue deficiency for UNS Gas of approximately $5 million; RUCOs testimony indicated a revenue deficiency of approximately $2 million. The procedural schedule for the UNS Gas rate case is as follows: Filing Date UNS Gas rebuttal testimony March 9, 2007 ACC Staff & intervenor rebuttal testimony March 30, 2007 UNS Gas rejoinder testimony April 6, 2007 Hearing before ALJ April 16, 2007 UNS Gas expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the second half of 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Gas capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $23 million. UNS Gas expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a large portion of its construction expenditures. If natural gas prices rise and UNS Gas is not allowed to recover its projected gas costs or PGA bank balance on a timely basis, UNS Gas may require additional funding to meet operating and capital requirements. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contribution from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Gas general rate case that was filed in July 2006. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 32 $ 14 $ 21 Capital Expenditures 23 23 19 Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Gas are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Gas $38 $33 $27 $28 $26 UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver In August 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric amended and restated their existing unsecured revolving credit agreement (UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver). The amendment reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings and, upon ACC approval, will increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to $60 million from $40 million, and extend the maturity from April 2008 to August 2011. Currently, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $30 million, but the total combined amount borrowed cannot exceed $40 million. Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. UNS Gas is only liable for UNS Gas borrowings, and similarly, UNS Electric is only liable for UNS Electrics borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. UES guarantees the obligations of both UNS Gas and UNS Electric. K 56 Table of Contents UNS Gas and UNS Electric have the option of paying interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver contains restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, mergers and sales of assets; it also contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for each borrower. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were each in compliance with the terms of the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. If an event of default occurs, the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, certain change in control transactions, certain bankruptcy events of UNS Gas or UNS Electric, or failure of UES, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to make payments or default on debt greater than $4 million. UNS Gas expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Gas had no outstanding borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Gas has $100 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding consisting of $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2011 and $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2015 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas restricts transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens, restricted payments and incurrence of indebtedness, and also contains a minimum net worth test. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Gas must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Gas may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $7 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Gas Supply Contracts UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005. The agreement was automatically extended one year and will continue to extend on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. Prices for incremental gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the market prices for the period during which the gas is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas hedged approximately 48% of its expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March). Additionally, UNS Gas has approximately 36% of its expected gas consumption hedged for April through October 2007, and 29% hedged for the period November 2007 through March 2008. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. UNS Gas currently has a transportation agreement with EPNG to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. This agreement has specific contract volumes in each month and specific receipt point rights from the available supply basins (San Juan and Permian). The average daily capacity rights of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March). EPNG filed a rate case in 2005 with new, higher rates effective in January 2006, subject to refund. The rate case participants reached a negotiated settlement and filed an agreement with FERC on December 6, 2006. FERC is expected to take action on the settlement agreement in the first half of 2007. UNS Gas contract with EPNG expires in August 2011, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. K 57 Table of Contents UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. The current contract with Transwestern expires in February 2007. UNS Gas entered into a new firm transportation contract with Transwestern through February 2012 with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. The new capacity rights under this agreement are: 250,000 therms per day October through April; 15,000 therms per day in May; and 10,000 therms per day June through September. Transwestern filed a rate case in October 2006 with new, higher rates to be effective in April 2007. The rate case participants are attempting to negotiate a settlement prior to the new rates becoming effective. The aggregate annual minimum transportation charges are expected to be approximately $9 million and $2 million for the EPNG and Transwestern contracts, respectively. These costs are passed through to our customers via the PGA. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Gas may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Gas will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures. UNS ELECTRIC RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNS Electric reported net income of $5 million in 2006 and 2005, and $4 million in 2004. Similar to TEPs operations, we expect UNS Electrics operations to be seasonal in nature, with peak energy demand occurring in the summer months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had approximately 93,000 retail customers, a 4% increase from last year. Retail kWh sales were 6% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. The table below shows UNS Electrics kWh sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The plan addressed all aspects of implementation. It included UNS Electrics unbundled distribution tariffs for both standard offer customers and customers that choose competitive retail access, as well as Direct Access and Settlement Fee schedules. UNS Electrics direct access rates for both transmission and ancillary services would be based upon its FERC Open Access Transmission Tariff. The plan is subject to review and approval by the ACC, which has not yet considered the plan. As a result of the court decisions concerning the ACCs Rules, we are unable to predict when and how the ACC will address this plan. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Competition, above for information regarding the Arizona Court of Appeals decision. Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Electrics retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit to the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under or over recovery of costs. The ACC has approved a PPFAC surcharge of $0.01825 per kWh to recover transmission costs and the cost of the current full requirements power supply agreement with PWMT. General Rate Case Filing UNS Electrics retail rates were last adjusted in August 2003. As a result of increased growth in UNS Electrics service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Electric to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Electrics request: Test year 12 months ended June 30, 2006 Original cost rate base $141 million Revenue deficiency $8.5 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 5.5% Cost of long term debt 8.2% Cost of equity 11.8% Actual capital structure 49% equity / 51% debt Weighted average cost of capital 9.9% K 59 Table of Contents The procedural schedule for the UNS Electric rate case is as follows: Filing Date ACC Staff and Intervenor testimony June 28, 2007 UNS Electric rebuttal testimony August 14, 2007 ACC Staff and Intervenor surrebuttal August 24, 2007 UNS Electric rejoinder testimony August 31, 2007 Hearing before ALJ September 10, 2007 UNS Electric also requested the ACC to approve the acquisition of the 90 MW BMGS combustion turbine project under development by UED with a post test year rate base adjustment effective June 1, 2008. The cost of the BMGS is expected to cost $60 million. UNS Electric expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in late 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. UNS Electric also requested that a new PPFAC surcharge take effect when the current power supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff See, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Electrics capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $39 million. UNS Electric expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a portion of its construction expenditures. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Electrics general rate case that was filed in December 2006. In June 2006, UniSource Energy contributed $10 million of capital to UNS Electric. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 14 $ 21 $ 19 Capital Expenditures 39 30 19 To improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County, UNS Electric completed a 20 MW gas fired combustion turbine at the Valencia site in 2006, and plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time. The turbine improves reliability while the approval and permitting process for the 345 kV Tucson to Nogales transmission line continues. In 2006, UNS Electrics capital expenditures included $7 million related to the turbine. See Item 1. Business, TEP Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Electric are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Electric $43 $40 $42 $27 $34 K 60 Table of Contents UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver See UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver above for description of UNS Electrics unsecured revolving credit agreement. UNS Electric expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. At February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had $25 million outstanding under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Electric has $60 million of 7.61% senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2008 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreements for UNS Electric contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens to secure indebtedness, restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness, and minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Electric must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Electric may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $5 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Electric Power Supply and Transmission Contracts UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT), which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price per MWh. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric is in the process of securing replacement energy resources when its supply contract ends with PWMT in 2008. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $27 million. The new UNS Electric power purchase contracts are subject to master agreements whereby UNS Electric may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values or if there has been a material change in creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had not been required to post such credit enhancement. UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electrics transmission capacity agreements with WAPA provide for annual rate adjustments and expire in February 2008 and June 2011. The contract that expires in 2008 also contains a capacity adjustment clause. Under the terms of the agreements, UNS Electrics aggregated minimum fixed transmission charges are expected to be $12 million in 2007 through 2011. UNS Electric made payments under these contracts of $8 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Electric contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Electric may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Electric will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures.

UED In 2006, UED purchased two electric generating turbines for $17 million. The turbines will be part of the 90 MW BMGS, to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, and, pending ACC approval is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. Construction is planned to begin during the third quarter of 2007 with an estimated completion date of May 2008. Including the purchase of the turbines, the total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $60 million. UED is financing the BMGS project with borrowings from UniSource Energy under an inter company note payable. At December 31, 2006, there was $22 million outstanding and interest is payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 1.25%. In 2005, UED had no significant operations. In 2004, UED recognized an impairment loss on its note receivable from an independent power producer. As UEDs recovery of the note receivable from the entity is subordinated to the rights of others, UED wrote off the entire $2 million balance due on the note at the time that Haddington, an investor in the independent power producer, determined that its investment was impaired. In 2004, UEDs net loss was $1 million. Discontinued Operations Global Solar Global Solar recorded losses of $2 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $5 million in 2004. On March 31, 2006, Millennium completed the sale of its interest in Global Solar. In these financial statements, UniSource Energy accounts for Global Solar as a discontinued operation and recognizes 100% of Global Solars losses. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Millennium Investments MEG is in the process of winding down its activities and does not expect to engage in any significant new activities. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of MEGs trading assets was $11 million and the fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million. Nations Energy Corporation (Nations Energy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, has been inactive since 2001. As of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, Nations Energy had a deferred tax asset of $3 million related to investment losses that has not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax return. K 62 Table of Contents Millennium is in the process of exiting its remaining investments. At December 31, 2006, the book value of Millenniums investments was $28 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Millennium made a $5 million dividend payment to UniSource Energy in February 2007 and is expected to make additional dividend payments totaling $10 million to UniSource Energy during the first half of 2007. In 2006, Millennium funded $2 million to Haddington under an existing commitment. In 2005, Haddington sold one of its investments and Millennium received a $6 million distribution related to the sale. In 2004, Millennium received a $7 million distribution from Haddington related to the gain on a sale of one of its investments. Millenniums remaining commitment is $1 million to Valley Ventures. In 2006, Millennium received the remaining payment of $5 million on a note receivable from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation and, in 2005, received a payment of $4 million. Millennium funded the remainder of its commitment to IPS in 2006. Millennium owns less than 10% of the equity of IPS. In 2005, Millennium received a $4 million payment from its investment in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V., (Sabinas) a Mexican limited liability company. The $4 million payment was treated as the return of capital and the book value of the investment in Sabinas was reduced to approximately $14 million. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. A $2 million payment due to Millennium in June 2006 was cancelled in exchange for payment by Mimosa, an affiliate of Sabinas, for up to $2 million to obtain a valuation of the interest in coal reserves and associated gas held by Mimosa. This evaluation is being performed under Millenniums direction, primarliy to determine the impact of current regulatory changes in Mexico on the value of the Sabinas investment. We expect the evaluation to be completed in 2007. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding required to fund Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. We believe such cash and returns will be adequate to fund Millenniums remaining commitments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. UniSource Energy and TEP consider Critical Accounting Estimates to be those that could result in materially different financial statement results if our assumptions regarding application of accounting principles were different. UniSource Energy and TEP describe their Critical Accounting Estimates below. Other significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates. Accounting for Rate Regulation TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric generally use the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (FAS 71), require special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to currently charge their customers to recover certain expenses, but instead may require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71 requires that TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are allowed to charge their customers. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then amortize these items as expense to the income statement as these charges are recovered from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced. The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of FAS 71 include: an independent regulator sets rates; the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering service; and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator. K 63 Table of Contents TEP Upon approval by the ACC of a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) in November 1999, TEP discontinued application of FAS 71 for its generation operations. TEP continues to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations, which include the transmission and distribution portions of its business. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $118 million at December 31, 2006. Regulatory assets of $61 million are not presently included in the rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. These regulatory assets are being recovered through the cost of service or are authorized to be collected in future base rates. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $163 million at December 31, 2005. TEP regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations. If TEP stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write off the related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2006, if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately $71 million. While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows, TEPs cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its regulatory assets. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $13 million at December 31, 2006 compared with regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities of $3 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electrics regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006 and $7 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electric has $11 million of regulatory liabilities and $1 million of regulatory assets that are not included in rate base. UNS Gas and UNS Electric regularly assess whether they can continue to apply FAS 71 to their cost based rate regulated operations. If UNS Gas and UNS Electric stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, they would write off the related balances of regulatory assets as an expense and regulatory liabilities as income on their income statements. Based on the balances of regulatory liabilities and assets at December 31, 2006, if UNS Gas and UNS Electric had stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, UNS Gas would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $8 million and UNS Electric would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $7 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics cash flows would not be affected if they stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited their ability to recover the cost of their regulatory assets. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, issued by the FASB, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred. A legal obligation is a liability that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract. A legal obligation can also be associated with the retirement of a long lived asset whose timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We are required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity should capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is adjusted to its present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the income statement each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the recorded amount. TEP In 2005, TEP implemented FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). The implementation of FIN 47 required TEP to update an existing inventory, originally created for the implementation of FAS 143, and to determine which, if any, of the conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated. The ability to reasonably estimate conditional asset retirement obligations was a matter of management judgment, based upon managements ability to estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, a method or potential method of settlement and probabilities associated with the potential dates and methods of settlement of TEPs conditional asset retirement obligations. In determining whether its conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated, management considered TEPs past practices, industry practices, managements intent and the estimated economic life of the assets. The fair value of the K 64 Table of Contents conditional asset retirement obligations were then estimated using an expected present value technique. Changes in managements assumptions regarding settlement dates, settlement methods or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liability recorded by TEP at December 31, 2006 as well as the associated cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded. The liabilities associated with conditional asset retirement obligations will be adjusted on an ongoing basis due to the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original estimates of undiscounted cash flows. These adjustments could have a significant impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information regarding the implementation and ongoing application of FIN 47, see Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Prior to implementing FAS 143, costs for final removal of all owned generation facilities were accrued as an additional component of depreciation expense. Under FAS 143, only the costs to remove an asset with legally binding retirement obligations will be accrued over time through accretion of the asset retirement obligation and depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had a liability of $4 million associated with its final asset retirement obligations. TEP has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets specified in land leases for its jointly owned Navajo and Four Corners Generating Stations. The land on which these stations reside is leased from the Navajo Nation. The provisions of the leases require the lessees to remove the facilities upon request of the Navajo Nation at the expiration of the leases. TEP also has certain environmental obligations at the San Juan Generating Station. TEP has estimated that its share of the cost to remove the Navajo and Four Corners facilities and settle the San Juan environmental obligations will be approximately $40 million at the date of retirement. No other legal obligations to retire generation plant assets were identified. In 2004, TEP, Phelps Dodge Energy Services, LLC and PNM Resources, Inc. each purchased from Duke Energy North America, LLC a one third interest in a limited liability company which owns the natural gas fired Luna Energy Facility (Luna) in Southern New Mexico. Luna is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was placed into commercial operation in April 2006. See Item 1. Business, Future Generating Resources TEP. The new owners assumed asset retirement obligations to remove certain piping and evaporation ponds and to restore the ground to its original condition. TEP has estimated its share to settle the obligations will be approximately $2 million at the date of retirement. TEP has various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. TEP operates its transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, TEP is not recognizing the costs of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had accrued $80 million for the net cost of removal for the interim retirements from its transmission, distribution and general plant. As of December 31, 2005, TEP had accrued $75 million for these removal costs. The amount is recorded as a regulatory liability. Amounts recorded under FAS 143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, estimating when final removal will occur, and the credit adjusted risk free interest rates to be used to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future as expense for asset retirement obligations. If TEP retires any asset at the end of its useful life, without a legal obligation to do so, it will record retirement costs at that time as incurred or accrued. TEP does not believe that the implementation of FAS 143 will result in any change in retail rates since all matters relating to the rate making treatment of TEPs generating assets have been determined pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric have various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. UNS Gas and UNS Electric operate their transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are not recognizing the cost of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. K 65 Table of Contents For the net cost of removal for interim retirements from transmission, distribution and general plant, UNS Gas accrued $4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $3 million as of December 31, 2005. UNS Electric accrued $2 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1 million as of December 31, 2005. The amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We record plan assets, obligations, and expenses related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions on discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries. TEP As a result of adopting FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in December 2006, TEP recognized the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability. The underfunded status was measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans. We expect volatility in the liability recognized in the balance sheet in future years as the funded status of our plans can change significantly due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience. The adjustment required to recognize the pension liability on adoption of this statement resulted in (i) recognition of a regulatory asset of $32 million representing a reasonable appropriation of the actuarial losses and prior service costs of TEPs pension plans that are probable of recovery in rates by its regulated operations in future periods and (ii) an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $17 million for our unregulated operations. We recorded the required increase in our other postretirement benefit obligation as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8 million as the ACC allows TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to recover other postretirement costs through rates only as benefit payments are made. Any change in the funded status of our plans due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience will be recognized as an adjustment to regulatory assets and other comprehensive income. TEP discounted its future pension plan obligations at 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP discounted its other postretirement plan obligations at a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP determines the discount rate annually based on the rates currently available on high quality, non callable, long term bonds. TEP looks to bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency whose future cash flows match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. For TEPs pension plans, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $7 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. A similar increase in the discount rate would decrease the PBO by approximately $8 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. For TEPs other postretirement benefit plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $2 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact plan expense by approximately $0.1 million. TEP calculates the market related value of plan assets using the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date. TEP assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.3% at December 31, 2006 and 8.5% at December 31, 2005. In establishing its assumption as to the expected return on plan assets, TEP reviews the plans asset allocation and develops return assumptions for each asset class based on advice from an investment consultant and the plans actuary that includes both historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets. Pension expense decreases as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases. A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact pension expense in 2007 by less than $0.5 million. TEP used an initial health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in valuing its postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2006. This rate reflects both market conditions and the plans experience. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A 1% increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. A similar decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. TEP will record pension expense of approximately $9 million and other postretirement benefit expense of $5 million ratably through 2007. TEP will make required pension plan K 66 Table of Contents contributions of $10 million in 2007. TEPs other postretirement benefit plan is not funded. TEP expects to make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $3 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted their future pension plan obligations using a rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. For UNS Gas and UNS Electrics pension plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact the benefit obligation and pension expense by less than $0.5 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record pension expense of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will make a pension plan contribution of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted its other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, compared with 5.8% at December 31, 2005. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record postretirement medical benefit expense and make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $0.1 million in 2007. Accounting for Derivative Instruments, Trading Activities and Hedging Activities A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from another investment or designated benchmark. TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically for one month, three months, or one year, within established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources (e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods). TEP enters into forward sales contracts when it forecasts that it has excess supply and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. A portion of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. However, some of these forward contracts which are derivatives satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Common Stock Equity, rather than being reflected in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments can be accounted for under multiple methods depending upon facts and circumstances, which can lead to variability in earnings. TEP has a natural gas supply agreement, that expires in February 2007, under which it purchases its gas requirements for its generating units located in Tucson, Arizona at spot market prices. TEP also has agreements to purchase power that are priced using spot market gas prices. These contracts meet the definition of normal purchases and are not required to be marked to market. In an effort to minimize price risk on these purchases, TEP enters into commodity price swap agreements under which TEP purchases gas at fixed prices and simultaneously sells gas at spot market prices. The spot market price in the swap agreements is tied to the same index as the purchases under the natural gas supply and purchased power contracts. These swap agreements, which expire during the summer months through 2009, were entered into with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of TEPs expected summer monthly gas risk prior to entering into the month. The swap agreements are marked to market on a monthly basis; however, since the agreements satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income rather than being reflected in the income statement. In June 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap in order to reduce the risk associated with unfavorable changes in variable interest rate payments related to changes in LIBOR. The swap has the effect of converting approximately $37 million of variable rate lease payments for the Springerville Common Lease to a fixed rate. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the interest rate swap is derived from models based on well recognized financial principles, which provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the swap as of the valuation date. Other models can be used to estimate the fair value of the swap and these models, which may use different assumptions or methods, may yield different results. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the swap is a liability of $2 million. TEP manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standardized agreement, which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. UNS Gas does not currently have any contracts that are required to be marked to market. UNS Gas does have a natural gas supply and management agreement under which it purchases substantially all of its gas requirements K 67 Table of Contents at market prices from BP Energy Company (BP). However, the contract terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its gas purchases by entering into fixed price forward contracts with BP at various times during the year. This enables UNS Gas to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of the expected monthly gas consumption prior to entering into the month. These forward contracts, as well as the main gas supply contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and therefore are not required to be marked to market. UNS Electric presently has a full requirements power supply agreement that enables it to meet its load. The agreement expires May 31, 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. In order to reduce exposure to energy price risk resulting from the procurement of power, UNS Electric has entered into forward power purchase contracts for specified amounts of energy at specified prices over a given period of time, within established limits. UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative and are marked to market by recording unrealized gains or losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In December 2006, the ACC issued an order allowing UNS Electric to record the unrealized net gains or losses as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. MEG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to Emission Allowances. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In accordance with UniSource Energys intention to cease making capital contributions to Millennium, Millennium has significantly reduced the holdings and activity of MEG. MEGs activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP, UNS Electric and MEGs derivative instruments at December 31, 2006, are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value. For TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. For MEGs remaining trading contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $0.1 million. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG). To date, the DIG has issued more than 100 interpretations to provide guidance in applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). As the DIG or the FASB continues to issue interpretations, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may change the conclusions they have reached and, as a result, the accounting treatment and financial statement impact could change in the future. See Market Risks Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A. K 68 Table of Contents Unbilled Revenue TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric TEPs, UNS Gass and UNS Electrics retail revenues include an estimate of MWhs/therms delivered but unbilled at the end of each period. Unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require managements judgment including estimates of retail sales and customer usage patterns. The unbilled revenue is estimated by comparing the estimated MWhs/therms delivered to the MWhs/therms billed to TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric retail customers. The excess of estimated MWhs/therms delivered over MWhs/therms billed is then allocated to the retail customer classes based on estimated usage by each customer class. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then record revenue for each customer class based on the various bill rates for each customer class. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of TEPs actual load, the unbilled revenue amount increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. The unbilled revenue amount for UNS Gas sales increases during the fall and winter months and decreases during the spring and summer months, whereas, the unbilled revenue amount for UNS Electric sales increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. Plant Asset Depreciable Lives TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric We calculate depreciation expense based on our estimate of the useful lives of our plant assets. The estimated useful lives, and resulting depreciation rates used to calculate depreciation expense for the transmission and distribution businesses of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have been approved by the ACC in prior rate decisions. Depreciation rates for transmission and distribution cannot be changed without ACC approval. The estimated remaining useful lives of TEPs generating facilities are based on managements best estimate of the economic life of the units. These estimates are based on engineering estimates, economic analysis, and statistical analysis of TEPs past experience in maintaining the stations. Our generation assets are currently depreciated over periods ranging from 23 to 70 years from the original in service dates. During the second quarter of 2005, a study requested by the participants in the San Juan Generating Station was completed which indicated San Juans economic useful life had changed from previous estimates. As a result of the study and other analysis performed, TEP lengthened the estimated useful life of San Juan from 40 to 60 years beginning April 1, 2005. TEPs annual depreciation expense related to San Juan decreased by $6 million as a result. During the first quarter of 2004, TEP engaged an independent third party to review the economic estimated useful lives of its owned generating assets in Springerville, Arizona. TEP then hired another independent third party to perform a depreciation study for its generation assets, taking into consideration the newly determined economic useful life for the Springerville assets, and changes in generation plant life information used by the operators and other participants of the joint power plants in which TEP participates. As a result of these analyses, TEP lengthened the useful lives of various generation assets for periods ranging from 11 to 22 years in July 2004. Consequently, depreciation rates and the corresponding depreciation expense have been revised prospectively to reflect the life extensions. The annual impact of these changes in depreciation rates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $9 million. Deferred Tax Valuation We record deferred tax liabilities for amounts that will increase income taxes on future tax returns. We record deferred tax assets for amounts that could be used to reduce income taxes on future tax returns. We record a valuation allowance, or reserve, for the deferred tax asset amount that we may not be able to use on future tax returns. We estimate the valuation allowance based on our interpretation of the tax rules, prior tax audits, tax planning strategies, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future taxable income. At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy had no valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, UniSource Energy had a valuation allowance of $7 million relating to net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amounts. The $7 million valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2005, relates to losses generated by the Millennium entities. As a result of the sale of Global Solar, the NOL and related valuation allowance were removed from the UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, UniSource Energys deferred income tax assets include $7 million and $9 million, respectively, related to unregulated investment losses of Millennium. These losses have not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax returns. If UniSource Energy were unable to K 69 Table of Contents recognize such losses through its consolidated income tax return in the foreseeable future, UniSource Energy would be required to write off these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, TEP had no valuation allowance. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB recently issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), FASB Interpretations (FIN), FASB Staff Positions (FSP), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issues (EITF): EITF 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation), approved June 2006, requires that we disclose our accounting policy regarding presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. Additionally, we must disclose the amounts of any taxes reported on a gross basis in interim and annual financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosures. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS 109, issued July 2006, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 requires disclosure of a rollforward of total unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. TEP recognized between $1 million and $2 million of income as an increase to Common Stock Equity on January 1, 2007 on the adoption of FIN 48. FAS 157, Fair Value Measurement, issued September 2006, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 clarifies that the exchange price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. We are required to disclose inputs used to develop fair value measurements and the effect of any of our assumptions on earnings or changes in net assets for the period. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our financial statements, and will incorporate these additional disclosure requirements in our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, issued September 2006, prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As we do not accrue planned major maintenance activities in advance, we anticipate no impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this FSP. FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, issued September 2006, requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and benefit obligation. FAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the incremental effect of adopting FAS 158. In the third quarter of 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law, which will be effective January 1, 2008. The new law will affect the manner in which many companies, including UniSource Energy and TEP, administer their pension plans. The legislation will require companies to increase the amount by which they fund their pension plans, increase premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for defined benefit plans, amend plan documents and provide additional disclosures in regulatory filings and to plan participants. We are currently assessing the impact it may have on our financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks We are exposed to various forms of market risk. Changes in interest rates, returns on marketable securities, and changes in commodity prices may affect our future financial results. K 71 Table of Contents For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements, above. Risk Management Committee We have a Risk Management Committee responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to the wholesale energy marketing activities of TEP, the emissions and trading activities of MEG, and the fuel and power procurement activities at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. Our Risk Management Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis and as needed, consists of officers from the finance, accounting, legal, wholesale marketing, transmission and distribution operations, and the generation operations departments of UniSource Energy. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to commodity price risk, the Risk Management Committee sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to credit risk, the Risk Management Committee reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits. Interest Rate Risk TEP is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on certain of its variable rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEPs debt included $329 million of tax exempt variable rate debt. The average interest rate on TEPs variable rate debt (excluding letter of credit fees) was 3.47% in 2006 and 2.48% in 2005. In June 2006, TEP refinanced variable rate lease debt totaling $68 million related to its Springerville Common Facilities Leases. The notes underlying the leases mature in June 2017 and January 2020. The notes were amended to provide that interest will be payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The interest rate in effect on the lease debt was 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. A 1% increase (decrease) in average interest rates would result in a decrease (increase) in TEPs pre tax income by approximately $4 million. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. Marketable Securities Risk TEP is exposed to fluctuations in the return on its marketable securities, which is comprised of investments in debt securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEP had marketable debt securities with an estimated fair value of $139 million and $165 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These debt securities represent TEPs investments in lease debt underlying certain of TEPs capital lease obligations. Changes in the fair value of such debt securities do not present a material risk to TEP, as TEP intends to hold these investments to maturity. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances. TEP Purchases and Sales of Energy To manage its exposure to energy price risk, TEP enters into forward contracts to buy or sell energy at a specified price and future delivery period. Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected excess generating capability, forward prices and generation costs, using a diversified market approach to provide a balance between long term, mid term and spot energy sales. TEP generally enters into forward purchases during its summer peaking period to ensure it can meet its load and reserve requirements and account for other contracts and resource contingencies. TEP also enters into limited forward purchases and sales to optimize its resource portfolio and take advantage of locational differences in price. These positions are managed on both a volumetric and dollar basis and are closely monitored using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk K 72 Table of Contents Management Committee. For example, the risk management policies provide that TEP should not take a short position in the third quarter and must have owned generation backing up all forward sales positions at the time the sale is made. TEPs risk management policies also restrict entering into forward positions with maturities extending beyond the end of the next calendar year except for approved hedging purposes. The majority of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales of electric energy and are not considered to be derivatives under FAS 133. TEP records revenues on its normal sales and expenses on its normal purchases in the period in which the energy is delivered. From time to time, however, TEP enters into forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. When TEP has derivative forward contracts, it marks them to market using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers for power traded over the counter at Palo Verde and at other southwestern U.S. trading hubs. TEP believes that these broker quotations used to calculate the mark to market values represent accurate measures of the fair values of TEPs positions because of the short term nature of TEPs positions, as limited by risk management policies, and the liquidity in the short term market. To adjust the value of its derivative forward power sales and purchases, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $6 $(1) $ TEP also reported the following net unrealized gains and losses on forward power sales and purchases in Wholesale Sales and Purchased Power. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $1 $(1) $2 TEP uses sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an unfavorable change in market prices on the fair value of its derivative forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Natural Gas TEP is also subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of natural gas. In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and to meet local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchase power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. In 2006, the average market price of natural gas was $6.05 per MMBtu, or 16% lower than 2005. The table below summarizes TEPs gas generation output and purchased power for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of MWhs % of Total Resources Gas Fired Generation 848 368 432 6% 3% 3% Purchased Power 1,644 1,639 1,322 12% 13% 10% K 73 Table of Contents To adjust the value of its derivative gas swap contracts, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Unrealized Gain (Loss) $(17) $11 $3 As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. Coal TEP is subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of coal used to fuel its coal fired generating plants. In 2003, TEP amended and extended the long term coal supply contract for Springerville Units 1 and 2 through 2020 and expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. During the extension period from 2011 through 2020, the coal price will be determined by the cost of Powder River Basin coal delivered to Springerville Unit 3 subject to a floor and ceiling. Based on current coal market conditions, this range would be from $24 to $30 per ton. TEP estimates its future minimum annual payments under this contract to be $45 million through 2010, the initial contract expiration date, and $14 million from 2011 through 2020. TEPs coal transportation contract at Springerville runs through June of 2011. TEP estimates minimum annual payments under this contract to be $13 million through 2010 and $7 million in 2011. In December 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through December 2008. Although TEP expects to pay $20 million annually, the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. In 2007, the impact on TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants is expected to increase by $17 million, or 9%. The long term rail contract for Sundt Unit 4 is in effect until the earliest of 2015, the remaining life of Sundt Unit 4 or the life of the coal mine. This rail contract requires TEP to transport at least 75,000 tons of coal per year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $2 million or to make a minimum payment of $1 million. TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan, where coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. In 2003, the Four Corners coal contract was extended through July 2016. This contract requires TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated annual cost of $6 million. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. The contracts to purchase coal for use at the jointly owned facilities require TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated average annual cost of $21 million for the next five years. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. UNS Gas UNS Gas is subject to commodity price risk, primarily from the changes in the price of natural gas purchased for its customers. This risk is mitigated through the PGA mechanism which provides an adjustment to UNS Gas retail rates to recover the actual costs of gas and transportation. UNS Gas further reduces this risk by purchasing forward fixed price contracts for a portion of its projected gas needs under its Price Stabilization Plan. UNS Gas purchases at least 45% of its estimated gas needs in this manner. UNS Electric UNS Electric is currently not exposed to commodity price risk for its purchase of electricity as it has a fixed price full requirements supply agreement with PWMT and a PPFAC mechanism which fully recovers the costs incurred K 74 Table of Contents under such contract on a timely basis. This supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $23 million. Because a portion of the costs under these contracts will vary from period to period based on the market price of gas, the PPFAC, as currently structured, may not provide recovery of the costs incurred under these new contracts on a timely basis. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. MEG MEG trades Emission Allowances and related instruments; however, its current activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. We manage the market risk of this line of business by setting notional limits by product, as well as limits to the potential change in fair market value under a 33% change in price or volatility. We closely monitor MEGs trading activities, which include swap agreements, options and forward contracts, using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk Management Committee. MEG marks its trading positions to market on a daily basis using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers and options pricing models for positions that extend through 2007. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the fair value of MEGs trading assets combined with Emission Allowances it holds in escrow was $11 million and $38 million, respectively. The fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million at December 31, 2006 and $24 million at December 31, 2005. For 2006, MEG reflected a $10 million unrealized loss and a $10 million realized gain on its income statement, compared with an unrealized gain of $11 million and a realized loss of $11 million in the same period last year. For MEGs remaining trading contracts at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $1 million. Unrealized Gain (Loss) of MEGs Trading Activities Millions of Dollars Source of Fair Value At December 31, 2006 Maturity 0 6 months Maturity 6 12 months Maturity over 1 yr. Total Unrealized Gain (Loss) Prices actively quoted $ 4 $ 2 $ $ 6 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 3 3 Total $ 4 $ 5 $ $ 9 Credit Risk UniSource Energy is exposed to credit risk in its energy related marketing and trading activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. We manage the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standard agreement which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. We calculate counterparty credit exposure by adding any outstanding receivable (net of amounts payable if a netting agreement exists) to the mark to market value of any forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, TEPs total credit exposure related to its wholesale marketing and gas hedging activities was approximately $34 million. Approximately $2 million of TEPs exposure is to non investment grade companies. TEP had five counterparties with exposures of greater than 10% of its total credit exposure, totaling approximately $23 million. MEGs total credit exposure related to its trading activities was $5 million and was concentrated primarily with two counterparties. MEG has no credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties. UNS Gas is subject to credit risk from non performance by its supply counterparty, BP Energy (BP), to the extent that this contract has a mark to market value in favor of UNS Gas. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas K 75 Table of Contents has purchased under fixed price contracts approximately 48% of the expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March) and approximately 29% of its expected consumption for the 2007/2008 winter season. At December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had no credit exposure under its supply contract with BP. UNS Electric has begun to enter into energy purchase agreements to replace the full requirements contract it has with PWMT that expires in May 2008. To the extent that such contracts have a positive mark to market value, UNS Electric would be exposed to credit risk under those contracts. At December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had less than $1 million in credit exposure under such contracts.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis explains the results of operations, the general financial condition, and the outlook for UniSource Energy and its three primary business segments and includes the following: outlook and strategies, operating results during 2006 compared with 2005, and 2005 compared with 2004, factors which affect our results and outlook, liquidity, capital needs, capital resources, and contractual obligations, dividends, and critical accounting estimates. UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant operations of its own. Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and liabilities. UniSource Energy owns the outstanding common stock of TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. (UES), Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. (Millennium), and UniSource Energy Development Company (UED). TEP, an electric utility, has provided electric service to the community of Tucson, Arizona, for over 100 years. UES was established in 2003, when it acquired the Arizona gas and electric properties from Citizens. UES, through its two operating subsidiaries, UNS Gas, Inc. (UNS Gas) and UNS Electric, Inc. (UNS Electric), provides gas and electric service to 30 communities in Northern and Southern Arizona. Millennium has existing investments in unregulated businesses; however no new investments are planned at Millennium. UED facilitated the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing the Black Mountain Generating Station (BMGS), a gas turbine project in Northern Arizona that, subject to approval, is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. We conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold its interest in Global Solar Energy, Inc. (Global Solar), its largest holding. At December 31, 2006, the investment in Millennium represented 3% of UniSource Energys Total Assets. UNISOURCE ENERGY CONSOLIDATED OUTLOOK AND STRATEGIES Our financial prospects and outlook for the next few years will be affected by many competitive, regulatory and economic factors. Our plans and strategies include the following: Efficiently manage our generation, transmission and distribution resources and seek ways to control our operating expenses while maintaining and enhancing reliability and profitability; Expand TEPs portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand and respond to wholesale market opportunities; Expand UNS Electrics portfolio of generating and purchased power resources to meet growing retail energy demand upon the expiration of the full requirements contract with PWMT; Resolve the uncertainty surrounding TEPs rates for generation service after 2008, while preserving TEPs benefits under the Settlement Agreement; Receive ACC approval of rate increases for UNS Gas and UNS Electric to provide adequate revenues to cover the rising cost of providing service to their customers; Enhance the value of existing generation assets by working with Salt River Project to support the construction of Springerville Unit 4; Enhance the value of TEPs transmission system while continuing to provide reliable access to generation for TEP and UNS Electrics retail customers and market access for all generating assets; K 29 Table of Contents Continue to develop synergies between UNS Gas,UNS Electric and TEP; Improve capital structure; and Promote economic development in our service territories. To accomplish our goals, during 2007 we expect to spend the following on capital expenditures: Segment Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 UNS Gas 38 UNS Electric 43 Other (1) 27 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 (1) Represents capital expenditures by UED related to the 90 MW BMGS to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, in UNS Electrics service area. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. While we believe that our plans and strategies will continue to have a positive impact on our financial prospects and position, we recognize that we continue to be highly leveraged, and as a result, our access to the capital markets may be limited or more expensive than for less leveraged companies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview UniSource Energy recorded Income Before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change of $69 million in 2006, $52 million in 2005 and $51 million in 2004. Net Income of $67 million in 2006 includes a $2 million loss from discontinued operations; net income of $46 million in 2005 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations and a $1 million loss from the cumulative effect of an accounting change; and net income of $46 million in 2004 includes a $5 million loss from discontinued operations. 2006 Compared With 2005 The improvement in UniSource Energys results in 2006 is due primarily to: the higher availability of TEPs coal fired generating plants; the start of commercial operations at Luna in April 2006; retail customer growth at TEP; interest savings related to various financing activities in 2005 and 2006; and the commencement of commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in August 2006. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below, and Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, below. On March 31, 2006, Millennium sold Global Solar for $16 million in cash and an option to purchase, under certain conditions, 5% to 10% of Global Solar in the future. In 2006, UniSource Energy recorded an after tax loss of approximately $2 million related to the discontinued operations and disposal of Global Solar. See Other Non Reportable Segments, Results of Operations, Discontinued Operations Global Solar, below. 2005 Compared With 2004 UniSource Energys results in 2005 were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned outages at several of TEPs coal plants. One of TEPs largest coal plants suffered a nearly month long outage in August 2005, during a period when customer demand was high and energy prices were boosted by the impact of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher natural gas prices and the cost of purchasing replacement power during the outage contributed to an 82% increase in TEPs purchased power expense. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Results of Operations, below. Also in 2005, UniSource Energy completed a financial restructuring, issuing $240 million of debt and using the proceeds to repay an inter company note and infuse capital into its subsidiaries. TEP retired approximately $321 million of debt and capital lease obligations (net of proceeds received from TEPs investment in lease debt). See K 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, below, and Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Financing Activities, Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES UniSource Energy Consolidated Cash Flows 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Cash provided by (used in): Operating Activities $ 283 $ 274 $ 307 Investing Activities (246 ) (170 ) (156 ) Financing Activities (77 ) (113 ) (98 ) UniSource Energys consolidated cash flows are provided primarily from retail and wholesale energy sales at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, net of the related payments for fuel and purchased power. Generally, cash from operations is lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. We use our available cash primarily to: fund capital expenditures at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric; pay dividends to shareholders; and reduce leverage. The primary source of liquidity for UniSource Energy, the parent company, is dividends it receives from its subsidiaries, primarily TEP. Also, under our tax sharing agreement, our subsidiaries make income tax payments to UniSource Energy, which makes payments on behalf of the consolidated group. The table below provides a summary of the liquidity position of UniSource Energy on a stand alone basis and each of its segments.

Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. (2) Includes cash and cash equivalents at Millennium. Executive Overview Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities were $283 million or $9 million higher than 2005. The increase is due primarily to: an increase in TEPs cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs; higher UNS Gas retail revenues; and the wind down of activity at MEG; partially offset by a $32 million payment made to the IRS and state tax authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $76 million higher in 2006 primarily due to: TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease; growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; utility system growth at UNS Gas and UNS Electric; the purchase of two gas turbines by UED; and TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna. Forecasted Capital Expenditures Business Segment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars TEP $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 293 UNS Gas 38 33 27 28 26 UNS Electric 43 39 42 28 34 Other 27 10 UniSource Energy Consolidated $ 306 $ 320 $ 264 $ 280 $ 353 Capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $331 million, or 39% higher than forecasted amounts reported in 2006. This increase is the result of several factors including: higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; generation needs for UNS Electric; and continued strong customer growth in UniSource Energys utility service territories. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities were $36 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. Factors impacting cash used for financing activities in 2006 include: an increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings and lower debt issuance costs; partially offset by an increase in net repayments of long term debt; higher payments on capital lease obligations by TEP; higher dividends paid by UniSource Energy to its shareholders. In 2005, UniSource Energy issued $240 million of debt, which it used to repay an inter company note to TEP and infuse K 32 Table of Contents capital into its subsidiaries. TEP used the proceeds from the inter company note repayment and capital infusion to retire $282 million of debt. As a result of the activities described above, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased to $104 million at December 31, 2006, from $145 million at December 31, 2005. We invest cash balances in high grade money market securities with an emphasis on preserving the principal amounts invested. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures at UniSource Energys subsidiaries, the revolving credit facilities at UniSource Energy, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may be used on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements of the strong utility customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt, as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy to its subsidiaries. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of rate related proceedings at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. For more information concerning liquidity and capital resources, see Tucson Electric Power Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Electric, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Other Non Reportable Segments, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. Convertible Senior Notes In March 2005, UniSource Energy issued $150 million of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035, which are unsecured and are not guaranteed by TEP or any other UniSource Energy subsidiary. Each $1,000 of Convertible Senior Notes is convertible into 26.6667 shares of our Common Stock at any time, representing a conversion price of approximately $37.50 per share of our Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Beginning in March 2010, UniSource Energy will have the option to redeem the notes, in whole or in part, for cash, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the notes will have the right to require UniSource Energy to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, for cash on March 1, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or if certain specified fundamental changes involving UniSource Energy occur. The repurchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a fundamental change that occurs prior to March 2010, UniSource Energy may be required to pay a make whole premium on notes converted in connection with the fundamental change. The make whole premium will be payable in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock or the consideration into which UniSource Energy Common Stock has been converted or exchanged in connection with such fundamental change. A fundamental change involving UniSource Energy will be deemed to have occurred if: (1) certain transactions occur as a result of which there is a change in control of UniSource Energy; or (2) UniSource Energy Common Stock ceases to be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq National Market or another established automated over the counter trading market in the United States. The notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes. The failure to make required payments on the notes or comply with the terms of the indenture may constitute an event of default. In addition, events of default may arise upon the acceleration of $50 million of indebtedness for borrowed money of UniSource Energy or TEP, or certain events of bankruptcy involving UniSource Energy or TEP. UniSource Energy Credit Agreement In August 2006, UniSource Energy amended and restated its existing credit agreement (UniSource Credit Agreement). The amendment extended the maturity from April 2010 to August 2011, reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings, and changed the amounts available under the term loan and the revolving credit facilities. As amended, the UniSource Credit Agreement consists of a $30 million term loan facility and a $70 million revolving credit facility. Prior to the amendment, the UniSource Credit Agreement included a $90 million term loan facility ($84 million outstanding) and a $15 million revolving credit facility (zero outstanding). On August 11, 2006, UniSource Energy repaid the $84 million outstanding term loan with $30 million of available cash, $30 million drawn under the new term loan and $24 million drawn under the revolving credit facility. K 33 Table of Contents Quarterly principal payments of $1.5 million on the outstanding term loan are due beginning in September 2006, with the balance due at maturity. At December 31, 2006, there was $27 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $20 million outstanding under the UniSource Energy revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 6.67%. In January 2007, UniSource Energy repaid the $20 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. We have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 1.25% or the sum of the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate and 0.25%. The UniSource Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of assets, and certain investments and acquisitions. We must also meet: (1) a minimum cash flow to debt service coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a standalone basis and (2) a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated basis. We may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend payment, we have more than $15 million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving credit. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the terms of the UniSource Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the UniSource Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UniSource Credit Agreement, failure of UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million, or certain bankruptcy events at UniSource Energy or certain subsidiaries. Guarantees and Indemnities In the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. We entered into these agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness of a subsidiary on a stand alone basis. The most significant of these guarantees at December 31, 2006 were: UES guarantee of $160 million of aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued by UNS Gas and UNS Electric to purchase the Citizens Arizona gas and electric system assets; UES guarantee of a $40 million revolving credit facility available to UNS Gas and UNS Electric; and UniSource Energys guarantee of approximately $5 million in natural gas and supply payments and building lease payments for UNS Gas and UNS Electric. To the extent liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries have indemnified the purchasers of interests in certain investments from additional taxes due for years prior to the sale. The terms of the indemnifications provide for no limitation on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided by all tax laws and paid all tax obligations. We have not made any payments under the terms of these indemnifications to date. We believe that the likelihood that UniSource Energy would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. K 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following charts display UniSource Energys consolidated contractual obligations by maturity and by type of obligation as of December 31, 2006. UniSource Energys Contractual Obligations Millions of Dollars Payment Due in Years Ending December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and after Total Long Term Debt Principal(1) $ 6 $ 223 $ 6 $ 6 $ 382 $ 555 $ 1,178 Interest(2) 67 65 49 49 44 534 808 Capital Lease Obligations(3): Springerville Unit 1(4) 83 82 30 57 83 401 736 Springerville Coal Handling 24 18 15 17 19 101 194 Sundt Unit 4 12 12 13 14 51 Springerville Common 6 6 6 6 6 148 178 Operating Leases 2 2 2 2 1 2 11 Purchase Obligations(5): Coal and Rail Transportation(6) 89 89 80 80 42 242 622 Purchase Power(7) 3 27 36 24 15 16 121 Electric Generating Turbines 21 6 27 Transmission 7 2 1 1 1 12 Gas(8) 50 38 19 12 8 127 Other Long Term Liabilities(9): Pension & Other Post Retirement Obligations(10) 15 4 4 5 5 32 65 San Juan Pollution Control Equipment(11) 17 41 7 65 Acquisition of Springerville Coal Handling and Common Facilities(12) 226 226 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 402 $ 615 $ 268 $ 273 $ 606 $ 2,257 $ 4,421 (1) Includes quarterly principal payments due on the term loan facility in UniSource Energys Credit Agreement and amounts outstanding under the UNS Electric revolving credit facility. TEPs Variable Rate IDBs are backed by LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August 2011. Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022, the above maturity reflects a redemption or repurchase of such bonds in 2011 as though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit Agreement. (2) Includes letter of credit and remarketing fees on variable rate debt. The interest rates for variable rate debt are estimated using Eurodollar futures rates for an approximation of LIBOR. For variable rate IDBs, a discount is applied to estimated LIBOR based on the historical discount the IDBs have had to LIBOR. (3) Beginning with commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 in September 2006, Tri State is reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the common facilities on an ongoing basis, including 14% of the Springerville Common Lease payments and 17% of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments. Similar reimbursement obligations are required after Unit 4 is constructed. TEP remains the obligor under these capital leases. Capital Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction associated with this reimbursement. (4) Annual payments under the Springerville Unit 1 lease vary in accordance with the amortization schedules of the debt underlying the capital lease, with significantly larger principal payments occurring in 2007, 2008 and 2011. (5) Purchase obligations reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. The total amount paid under these contracts depends on the quantity purchased and transported. TEP and UES requirements are expected to be in excess of K 35 Table of Contents these minimums. UniSource Energy has excluded open purchase orders of approximately $13 million expected to be fulfilled in 2007. (6) Based on prior years expenditures, TEP expects to spend approximately $200 million annually for the purchase and transportation of coal through 2010. TEP is unable to estimate how much it will spend under these contracts beyond 2010 due to the impact of the amended Springerville coal contract. (7) Includes TEP and UNS Electrics forward power purchases. TEP has not included capacity payments under TEPs purchased power agreement with Tri State which may be reduced in increments of 25 MW with 90 days notice. To date, TEP has received no such notice. If Tri State does not give notice to reduce capacity, the minimum capacity payments will be $31 million annually in 2007 through 2010 and $21 million in 2011. UniSource Energy also has not included amounts payable to PWMT under UNS Electrics full requirements power supply agreement as payments under this contract are usage based with no fixed demand charges and are recovered through the purchased power and fuel adjustment clause (PPFAC) mechanism. We expect to spend approximately $100 million annually under this contract through May 2008. (8) Amounts include UNS Gas fixed price forward gas purchases and firm transportation agreements with EPNG and Transwestern. Incremental gas purchases are excluded as prices and volumes vary. Amounts also exclude swap agreements which are marked to market on a monthly basis and do not include any minimum payment obligation. UNS Gas entered into forward gas purchases for 2007 through 2010 totaling $9 million subsequent to December 31, 2006, which are excluded from the table above. (9) Excludes TEPs liability for final environmental reclamation at the coal mines which supply the remote generating stations. TEP estimates its undiscounted final reclamation liability is $41 million with reclamation beginning in 2028. See Note 6. Also excludes asset retirement obligations expected to occur through 2066. See Note 3. Also, excludes Millenniums equity commitments totaling $1 million over two years to fund subsidiaries (Valley Ventures) as suitable investments are identified. (10) These obligations represent TEP and UES minimum required contributions to pension plans in 2007 and TEPs expected postretirement benefit costs to cover medical and life insurance claims as determined by the plans actuaries. TEP and UES do not know and have not included pension contributions beyond 2007 due to the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts. TEP funds the postretirement benefit plan on a pay as you go basis. (11) These obligations represent TEPs share of the cost of new pollution control equipment based on its ownership of San Juan. Under a settlement agreement signed in March 2005 with the New Mexico Environmental Department and environmental activist groups, the co owners of San Juan will install new technology at the generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx, and SO2 emissions. In addition, TEPs share of increased operating and maintenance costs associated with the new technologies is expected to be approximately $12 million over the next 10 years. (12) TEP has agreed with the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP is obligated to acquire the facilities at fixed prices of $120 million in 2015, $38 million in 2017, and $68 million in 2021. Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 17% and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: We do not have any provisions in any of our debt or lease agreements that would cause an event of default or cause amounts to become due and payable in the event of a credit rating downgrade. None of our contracts or financing structures contains provisions or acceleration clauses due to changes in our stock price. Dividends on Common Stock On February 9, 2007, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.225 per share on its Common Stock. The first quarter dividend, totaling approximately $8 million, will be paid March 14, 2007 to shareholders of record at the close of business February 20, 2007. During 2006, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.21 per share, totaling approximately $29 million. In 2005, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to its shareholders of $0.19 per share, totaling approximately $26 million. Income Tax Position At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal and state income tax filing purposes, the following carryforward amounts: UniSource Energy TEP Amount Expiring Amount Expiring Millions of Dollars Year Millions of Dollars Year Capital Loss $ 37 2010 2011 $ AMT Credit 48 34 K 36 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Service Matters On its 2002 tax return, TEP filed for an automatic change in accounting method relating to the capitalization of indirect costs to the production of electricity and self constructed assets. The new accounting method was also used on the 2003 and 2004 returns for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. In August 2005, the IRS issued a ruling which draws into question the ability of electric and gas utilities to use the new accounting method. As a result, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have filed amended returns for 2002, 2003 and 2004 to remove the benefit previously claimed using the accounting method. In 2006, TEP and UNS Electric remitted tax and interest of $23 million and $1 million respectively to the IRS; and TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric remitted $8 million to state authorities. In December 2006, the IRS issued a final notice to the company disallowing the use of the accounting method. We are in the process of filing a protest and will proceed to appeals. TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The financial condition and results of operations of TEP are currently the principal factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of UniSource Energy on an annual basis. The following discussion relates to TEPs utility operations, unless otherwise noted. 2006 Compared With 2005 TEP recorded net income of $67 million in 2006 compared with $48 million in 2005. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2006 included: a $53 million increase in total operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather during the second quarter and retail customer growth; a $9 million increase in wholesale revenues due primarily to $3 million of transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in unrealized gains related to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Margins on wholesale sales were lower than last year due to a decline in the average market price for power; a $23 million increase in other revenues due primarily to fees and reimbursements received from Tri State for fuel and O&M costs related to Springerville Unit 3; a $24 million decrease in purchased power expense due to increased production at TEPs coal fired generating plants and the availability of Luna to offset some of the wholesale purchases to meet retail customer demand during peak summer periods. Purchased power expense also reflects a $4 million increase in unrealized losses due to mark to market adjustments on forward purchases of energy; offset by a $31 million increase in fuel expense due to increased generation at TEPs coal fired plants, gas related fuel expense at Luna and $8 million of fuel costs associated with Springerville Unit 3; a $31 million increase in O&M expense. TEPs O&M includes $9 million of expenses related to Springerville Unit 3. In addition, pre tax gains related to the sale of excess SO2 emission allowances were $7 million lower than 2005. Other factors contributing to higher O&M include operating expenses at Luna; generating plant maintenance; and higher payroll expenses; a $10 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and K 37 Table of Contents a $13 million decrease in total interest expense due primarily to lower interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations, which was partially offset by interest paid to the IRS related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and fees incurred in the third quarter of 2006 related to amending TEPs Credit Agreement. In 2006, the net pre tax benefit recognized by TEP related to Springerville Unit 3 for transmission revenues, operating fees and its share of the common costs was $8 million. 2005 Compared With 2004 TEP recorded income before cumulative effect of accounting change of $49 million in 2005 compared with $46 million in 2004. The following factors contributed to the improvement: 2005 Included: a $26 million decrease in TEPs total operating revenue less fuel and purchased power expense due to the following: a $60 million increase in TEPs purchased power expense resulting primarily from an extended unplanned outage of Springerville Unit 2 in August 2005, planned maintenance outages at San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 during the second quarter and higher wholesale power prices; a $14 million increase in TEPs fuel expense due to a $3 million increase in natural gas costs primarily from higher gas prices and an $11 million increase in coal costs; a $28 million increase in retail revenues due to warm weather and a 3% increase in TEPs customer base; and a $19 million increase in TEPs wholesale revenues due to higher market prices for power compared to last year. a $22 million decrease in O&M. Higher maintenance costs at TEPs coal fired plants were offset by an increase of $10 million in pre tax gains on the sale of excess SO2 Emission Allowances by TEP; a $6 million increase in the amortization of TEPs TRA; and a $17 million decrease in total interest expense related to the financial restructuring of TEP in May 2005. 2004 Included: expenses of $8 million related to a proposed but terminated acquisition of UniSource Energy. Utility Sales and Revenues Customer growth, weather and other consumption factors affect retail sales of electricity. Electric wholesale revenues are affected by market prices in the wholesale energy market, the availability of TEP generating resources, and the level of wholesale forward contract activity. K 38 Table of Contents The table below provides trend information on retail sales by major customer class and electric wholesale sales made by TEP in the last three years as well as weather data for TEPs service territory.

Wholesale revenues increased $9 million in 2006 compared with last year. In 2006, wholesale revenues included $3 million in transmission revenues related to Springerville Unit 3 and a $6 million increase in net unrealized gain due to mark to market adjustments on forward sales. Wholesale kWh sales increased 8% primarily due to the higher availability of TEPs coal plants; however, margins on wholesale sales were lower due to a 16% decrease in the average market price of wholesale energy. TEPs margins on wholesale sales were higher in 2005, as hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico boosted market prices for wholesale energy in the last six months of the year. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Mark to Market Adjustments on Trading Activity The table below summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) on TEPs forward sales and purchases of energy. Net unrealized gains (losses) on forward sales of energy are presented on the income statement in wholesale revenues.

Residential kWh sales increased 5% and commercial kWh sales increased 4% during 2005. Despite lower coal plant availability and a 3% decrease in wholesale kWh sales, wholesale revenues increased $18 million, or 11%, in 2005 compared with 2004. The average wholesale market price of energy was $59 per MWh in 2005, compared with $44 per MWh in 2004. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Western Energy Markets, Market Prices, below. Operating Expenses 2006 Compared with 2005 Fuel and Purchased Power TEPs fuel and purchased power expense, and energy resources for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are detailed below: Generation Expense 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of kWh Millions of Dollars Coal Fired Generation Four Corners 812 783 749 $ 12 $ 11 $ 10 Navajo 1,215 1,221 1,244 17 16 15 San Juan 2,486 2,484 2,435 56 53 48 Springerville 5,826 5,572 5,731 96 94 92 Sundt 4 623 787 735 14 16 14 Total Coal Fired Generation 10,962 10,847 10,894 $ 195 $ 190 $ 179 Gas Fired Generation Luna 516 24 Other Units 334 368 432 31 36 34 Total Gas Fired Generation 850 368 432 55 36 34 Solar and Other Generation 9 9 8 Total Generation (1) 11,821 11,224 11,334 250 226 213 Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 103 131 73 Net Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Forward Purchases of Energy 6 2 Total Purchased Power 1,707 1,639 1,322 109 133 73 Total Resources 13,528 12,863 12,656 $ 359 $ 359 $ 286 Less Line Losses and Company Use 886 806 821 Total Energy Sold 12,642 12,057 11,835 (1) Fuel expense in 2006 excludes $8 million related to Springerville Unit 3; the fuel costs incurred on behalf of Unit 3 are recorded in Fuel Expense and the reimbursement by Tri State is recorded in Other Revenue. The start of commercial operation of Luna and higher coal plant availability in the summer months led to a $24 million increase in fuel expense in 2006 (excluding fuel expenses at Springerville Unit 3); however, purchased power expense decreased $24 million as these same factors reduced TEPs need to purchase power during the summer months to meet retail demand. Gas fired generation more than doubled in 2006, causing gas related fuel expense to increase $19 million, or 53%. Coal fired generation increased 1%, leading to a $5 million increase in coal related fuel expense. Lunas generation output reported in the table above includes energy generated during its test phase, but does not include any associated fuel costs which were capitalized and reported as project costs. Despite a 4% increase in purchased energy volumes, purchased power expense was $24 million, or 18%, lower due to a decrease in average wholesale energy prices in 2006 as well as fewer short term purchases during the summer months when market prices for wholesale energy are typically higher. In September 2006, TEP began purchasing energy from Tri State under a 100 MW purchased power agreement. The table below shows TEPs average resource cost per kWh generated: K 40 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 cents per kWh Coal 1.78 1.75 1.64 Gas 6.69 9.78 7.87 All sources 2.61 2.01 1.88 *In 2006, the average cost of gas generation per kWh excludes test energy produced at Luna and its associated fuel costs. TRA amortization increased $10 million in 2006. Amortization of the TRA is the result of the Settlement Agreement with the ACC, which changed the accounting method for TEPs generation operations. This item reflects the recovery, through 2008, of transition recovery assets which were previously regulatory assets of the generation business. The amount of amortization is a function of the TRA balance and total kWh consumption by TEPs distribution customers. The table below shows estimated annual TRA amortization and unamortized TRA year end balances for 2007 and 2008. Estimated Unamortized TRA Amortization TRA Balance Millions of Dollars 2007 76 26 2008 26 Other Income (Deductions) In 2005, TEPs Income Statement included inter company Interest Income of $2 million. This represented Interest Income on a promissory note TEP received from UniSource Energy in exchange for the transfer to UniSource Energy of its stock in Millennium in 1998. UniSource Energy repaid the inter company promissory note on March 1, 2005. On UniSource Energys Consolidated Statement of Income, this Interest Income, as well as UniSource Energys related interest expense, was eliminated as an inter company transaction. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, TEP Cash Flows, Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy, below. Operating Expenses 2005 Compared with 2004 Fuel and Purchased Power During 2005, planned outages at Springerville Unit 2, San Juan Unit 2 and Four Corners Unit 5 and an extended unplanned outage at Springerville Unit 2 during the third quarter led to higher gas related fuel costs and an 82% increase in purchased power expense. Purchased power expense increased $60 million compared with 2004, due to a 19% increase in MWhs purchased and an increase in wholesale market prices for power. The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Palo Verde Index increased 34% in 2005 compared with average prices in 2004. A combination of higher coal and natural gas costs contributed to a $13 million increase in total fuel expense at TEPs generating plants in 2005. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change TEP adopted FIN 47 in December 2005 and recorded a one time $1 million after tax cost. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and Critical Accounting Estimates, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, below. K 41 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Competition In 2001, all of TEPs retail customers became eligible to choose an alternative energy service provider (ESP), however, only a small number of commercial and industrial customers initially chose an ESP. By 2002, none of TEPs retail customers were served by an alternative ESP. In 2004, an Arizona Court of Appeals decision held invalid certain portions of the ACC rules on retail competition and related market pricing. In February 2006, the ACC Staff requested that a proceeding be opened to address the issue of retail electric competition. We cannot predict what changes, if any, the ACC will make to the competition rules. TEP has met all conditions required by the ACC to facilitate electric retail competition, including ACC approval of TEPs direct access tariffs. See Rates, ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement, below. TEP competes against gas service suppliers and others that provide energy services. Other forms of energy technologies may provide competition to TEPs services in the future, but to date, are generally not financially viable alternatives for its retail customers. Self generation by TEPs large industrial customers could also provide competition for TEPs services in the future, but has not had a significant impact to date. In the wholesale market, TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy. ACC Order to Review the Settlement Agreement Beginning in May 2005, TEP filed a series of pleadings requesting the ACC to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the methodology that will be applied to determine TEPs rates for generation service after 2008. TEP filed the pleadings in response to the Arizona Court of Appeals ruling related to retail competition and market pricing and a lack of agreement as to the interpretation of the Settlement Agreement by a number of participants in TEPs rate proceedings. TEP believes that the Settlement Agreement contemplated market based rates for generation service after 2008. See Competition, above for information regarding the recent court ruling. In April 2006, the ACC ordered that a procedure be established to allow for an expeditious and complete review of, among other things, the Settlement Agreement and its effect on how TEPs rates for generation services will be determined after December 31, 2008. The testimony filed by a number of participants in this proceeding, including the ACC Staff and Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO), reflect differing interpretations of the Settlement Agreement and a belief that TEP is required to charge cost of service rates for generation service in 2009. According to testimony filed by TEP, its average retail rate would increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. TEP also proposed two alternatives to charging market based rates for generation in 2009: a market phase in proposal with an initial rate increase capped at 12%; and a cost of service (including an $850 million regulatory asset and energy cost adjustment clause) proposal that would increase average retail rates in 2009 approximately 26% over current rates. See TEP Testimony, The Market Phase in Proposal, and The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal, below for more information. In February 2007, parties in this proceeding participated in settlement discussions, however were unable to reach a settlement. A public hearing before an ACC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) is scheduled to begin on March 6, 2007. Following the public hearing, the ALJ will propose a recommended opinion and order for consideration by the ACC. We expect the ALJ to issue a recommendation in the second quarter of 2007. If the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement allowing TEP to charge market based rates for generation service in 2009 and orders TEP to return to cost of service generation rates without compensating TEP for financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, TEP will file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages. K 42 Table of Contents Rates Settlement Agreement In 1999, the ACC approved the Rules that provided a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric competition in Arizona. The Rules and the Settlement Agreement established: a period from November 1999 through 2008 for TEP to transition its generation assets from a cost of service based rate structure to a market, or competitive, rate structure; the recovery through rates during the transition period of $450 million of stranded generation costs through a fixed competitive transition charge (Fixed CTC); capped rates for TEP retail customers through 2008; an ACC interim review of TEP retail rates in 2004; unbundling of electric services with separate rates or prices for generation, transmission, distribution, metering, meter reading, billing and collection, and ancillary services; a process for ESPs to become licensed by the ACC to sell generation services at market prices to TEP retail customers; access for TEP retail customers to buy market priced generation services from ESPs beginning in 2000 (currently, no TEP customers are purchasing generation services from ESPs); transmission and distribution services would remain subject to regulation on a cost of service basis; and beginning in 2009, TEPs generation would be market based and its retail customers would pay the market rate for generation services. Track A and Track B Proceedings During 2002 and 2003, the ACC reexamined circumstances that had changed since it approved the Rules in 1999. The outstanding issues were divided into two groups. Track A related primarily to the divestiture of generation assets while Track B related primarily to the competitive energy bidding process. Under the ACCs Rules, TEP and other utilities were required to divest their generation assets. TEP later requested a waiver of the divestiture requirement. The Track A order granted TEPs request and eliminated the divesture requirement. As a result, generation assets remain at TEP. At the same time, the ACC ordered the parties, including TEP, to develop a competitive bidding process and reduced the minimum amount of power to be acquired in the competitive bidding process to only that portion not supplied by TEPs existing resources. The ACC Track B order defined the competitive bidding process TEP must use to obtain capacity and energy requirements. The Track B order did not address TEPs purchased power or asset acquisitions occurring subsequent to the 2003 competitive solicitation. 2004 General Rate Case Information In June 2004, as required by the Settlement Agreement, TEP filed general rate case information with the ACC. TEPs filing did not propose any change in retail rates and, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no rate case filed by TEP through 2008 may result in a net rate increase. However, absent the restriction on raising rates, TEP believes that the data in its filing would have justified an increase in retail rates of 16%. The general rate case information used a historical test year ended December 31, 2003 and established, based on TEPs standard offer service, that TEP was experiencing a revenue deficiency of $111 million. None of the intervenor testimony filed proposed any decrease to TEPs rates. Testimony filed by the ACC Staff, Residential Utility Consumer Office and Arizonans for Electric Choice and Competition indicated revenue deficiencies for TEP of $67 million, $32 million and $38 million, respectively. In 2005, the ALJ issued a procedural order suspending the remaining testimony filing deadlines and hearing in the 2004 rate review. K 43 Table of Contents TEP Testimony In August 2006, TEP filed testimony in the ACC proceedings to review the Settlement Agreement. TEPs testimony states its belief that it is entitled to charge market based generation service rates in 2009 and has complied with its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. TEP testimony states that the Settlement Agreement provided the terms and conditions by which TEP is to transition into the competitive electric marketplace. The rate impact of charging market based generation service rates in 2009 would vary with market conditions which are influenced by the cost of natural gas. Assuming a natural gas cost of $7 per MMBtu, which equates to a wholesale power price of approximately $60 per MWh, TEPs average retail rate would be expected to increase approximately 23% over current rates if 2009 generation service rates are market based. The Settlement Agreement required TEP to significantly change the way it conducted business. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, TEP agreed to: (i) rate reductions in 1999 and 2000; (ii) a rate freeze from July 1, 2000 through December 31, 2008, taking all the risk of inflation and cost increases; (iii) unbundled tariffed rates; (iv) accelerate depreciation of certain generation related assets; (v) offset the standard offer generation rate (Market Generation Credit) by the amount of the Floating Competition Transition Charge; (vi) open its exclusive service territory to competition for generation service; (vii) assume the volatility and risk of market rates in 2009; and (viii) a rate check in 2004 when rates could not increase but could actually decrease. In the testimony, TEP states that if the ACC or other parties to the Settlement Agreement seek to unilaterally change the contract and order TEP back to cost of service, which is a breach that will force TEP to protect its rights in court and seek an order, which may include an award for damages. TEP states that, if the ACC does not honor the Settlement Agreement, does not agree to one of TEPs alternative proposals, and orders that TEPs generation service rates will be based on traditional cost of service ratemaking without compensating TEP for the financial impacts of the Settlement Agreement, then TEP must: (1) file a rate case and (2) immediately file a lawsuit to preserve its right to declaratory relief and damages arising from the ACCs breach of the Settlement Agreement. TEP states that the financial impacts and costs directly attributable to the Settlement Agreement exceed $850 million. In the testimony, TEP offered alternatives to charging market based generation service rates after December 31, 2008, as described below. The Market Phase In Proposal TEP proposed a market rate phase in plan in the event that the ACC desires to maintain a competitive wholesale generation market, but wants to mitigate the immediate impact of market rates. Elements of the market rate phase in include: A cap would be set such that no customer class would realize an initial rate increase in excess of 12%. The phase in period would begin in 2009, last approximately four years and then be fully market based; TEPs current rates would remain frozen through the end of 2008; and Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs. The Cost of Service (including Regulatory Asset and Energy Cost Adjustment Clause) Proposal TEPs cost of service proposal presents a framework for returning TEP to cost of service regulation for generation service if the ACC determines that it will abandon the concept of a competitive wholesale and retail generation market. Elements of the proposal include: A new regulatory asset of $850 million to be included in rate base will be created to compensate TEP for the financial impacts and costs incurred in performing under the Settlement Agreement; An energy cost adjustment clause (ECAC) to recover energy costs associated with serving the incremental retail load above that filed in its cost of service test year; Immediate filing of a cost of service rate case in 2007; K 44 Table of Contents Implementation of the new DSM, REST and TOU programs and tariffs; and Restore exclusivity of TEPs certificate of convenience and necessity. The proposed ECAC would differ from some other purchase power and fuel clauses in that it would not include any fuel or purchased power price risks or plant operating risks associated with serving the test year portion of TEPs retail load. Also, the ECAC would not be a straight pass through of purchased power costs to serve the incremental load. In the event that TEPs actual fuel and purchased power costs related to the incremental load exceeds the ECAC rate, TEP would not be able to pass the excess costs through to customers. However, in the event that those costs are less than the ECAC rate, TEP would be entitled to retain those earnings. If the ACC adopts TEPs cost of service proposal and approves a new regulatory asset of $850 million and implementation of the ECAC mechanism, TEP expects that its average retail rate in 2009 would increase by approximately 26% over current rates. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff In October 2006, the ACC approved new Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules (REST rules) designed to require TEP, UNS Electric and other affected utilities to generate or purchase at least 15% of their total annual retail energy requirements from renewable energy technologies by 2025, with smaller amounts required in earlier years starting when the REST tariff submitted by an affected utility is approved by the ACC. To provide an opportunity for full recovery of the increased costs of meeting the more aggressive standard, the adopted REST rules allow for a new tariff to be implemented separate and apart from the existing Environmental Portfolio Surcharge. The rules require affected utilities to annually file with the ACC a REST tariff request with a REST implementation plan to recover the cost of purchasing or installing and operating the renewable resources. The tariff amount is annually subject to ACC approval. The REST rules require utilities to file annual compliance reports outlining the results of the renewable programs implemented the prior year, highlighting steps they are taking to meet the REST annual renewable energy requirements. The REST rules adopted by the ACC must be certified by the Arizona Attorney General before taking effect. As of February 23, 2007, the Attorney General had not issued an opinion certifying the REST rules. Western Energy Markets As a participant in the Western U.S. wholesale power markets, TEP is directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions and market participants. TEP competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers in the sale of electric capacity and energy at market based rates in the wholesale market. At the end of 2006, electric generating capacity in Arizona was approximately 25,600 MW, an increase of 61% since 2001. A majority of the growth is the result of 17 new or upgraded gas fired generating units with a combined capacity of approximately 9,700 MW. The completion of Springerville Unit 3 in 2006 provided 400 MW of new coal fired generation located in Arizona. Market Prices The average market price for around the clock energy based on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index decreased in 2006, as did the average price for natural gas based on the Permian Index. We cannot predict whether changes in various factors that influence demand and supply will cause prices to change during 2007. K 45 Table of Contents Average Market Price for Around the Clock Energy $/MWh Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 48 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 78 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 50 Year ended December 31, 2005 59 Average Market Price for Natural Gas $/MMBtu Quarter ended December 31, 2006 $ 5.58 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 9.67 Year ended December 31, 2006 $ 6.05 Year ended December 31, 2005 7.17 In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel and gas indexed purchased power with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP currently has approximately 35% of this exposure hedged for the summer peak period of 2007 (June September) at a weighted average price of $7.18 per MMBtu. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. Market prices may also affect TEPs wholesale revenues. TEP commits to future sales of energy as part of its ongoing efforts to hedge its excess generation based on projected generation capability, forward prices and generation costs. For the first quarter of 2007, TEP has sold forward approximately 255,000 MWh at an average price of $70 per MWh, which excludes on peak hours in April through September. We expect the market price and demand for capacity and energy to continue to be influenced by factors including: availability and price of natural gas; weather; continued population growth in the Western U.S.; economic conditions in the Western U.S.; availability of generating capacity throughout the Western U.S.; the extent of electric utility industry restructuring in Arizona, California and other Western states; FERC regulation of wholesale energy markets; availability of hydropower; transmission constraints; and environmental regulations and the cost of compliance. Coal Supply On December 28, 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through 2008. The cost of coal and transportation under the agreements will increase approximately 60%, primarily due to significantly higher rail costs. Based on these agreements, and increases at other coal fired plants, we expect TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants to increase by approximately $17 million, or 9% in 2007. Emission Allowances TEP has SO2 Emission Allowances in excess of what is required to operate its generating units. The excess results primarily from a higher removal rate of SO2 emissions at Springerville Units 1 and 2 following recent upgrades to environmental plant components and related changes to plant operations. From time to time, TEP will sell a portion of its excess SO2 Emission Allowances. The table below summarizes sales made in 2005 and 2006, and forward sales of SO2 Emission Allowances, as of December 31, 2006. K 46 Table of Contents Delivery Allowances Sold Pre tax Gain (millions) 2005 15,000 $13 2006 10,000 7 2007 10,000 8 In addition to the allowances contracted to be sold in 2007, TEP expects to have approximately 20,000 excess SO2 Emission Allowances through 2009. Springerville Units 3 and 4 Springerville Unit 3, which commenced commercial operation in July 2006, is a 400 MW coal fired generating facility located at the same site as Springerville Units 1 and 2. Tri State is leasing 100% of Unit 3 from a financial owner. TEP allocates a portion of the fixed costs of the existing common facilities to the additional generating unit. TEP operates Unit 3 and will receive annual pre tax benefits of approximately $15 million in the form of transmission revenues, rental payments and other fees and cost savings. As part of the project, Tri State provided funding to improve sulfur dioxide scrubbers, low nitrogen oxide burners and other emission control upgrades for Units 1 and 2, which were completed in 2005. SRP is purchasing 100 MW of capacity from Tri State under a 30 year power purchase agreement. In May 2006, SRP announced its intention to build Unit 4, a 400 MW coal fired generating facility at the same Springerville site. Construction of Unit 4 has begun and, under the terms of existing regulatory permits, is required to be completed by December 31, 2009. Prior to Unit 4s completion, TEP may be required, along with Tri State, to exercise best efforts to find a replacement purchaser for SRP to purchase 100 MW of capacity from Unit 3. If TEP and Tri State are unable to find such a replacement purchaser, TEP would then purchase 100 MW of output from Unit 4, beginning with the commercial operation of Unit 4. Given the current level of wholesale power market prices, we believe it is unlikely that TEP would be required to find a replacement purchaser or to purchase SRPs 100 MW. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TEP Cash Flows During 2007, TEP expects to generate sufficient internal cash flows to fund most of its construction expenditures as well as its operating activities, required debt maturities and dividends to UniSource Energy. Cash flows may vary during the year, with cash flow from operations typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter due to TEPs summer peaking load. As a result of the varied seasonal cash flow, TEP will use, as needed, its revolving credit facility to fund its business activities. The table below shows the cash available to TEP after capital expenditures, scheduled debt payments and payments on capital lease obligations: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Capital Expenditures (156 ) (150 ) (129 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Amounts from Statements of Cash Flows: Less: Scheduled Repayments of Long Term Debt (2 ) Less: Retirement of Capital Lease Obligations (61 ) (53 ) (49 ) Plus: Proceeds from Investment in Lease Debt 22 14 12 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* $ 32 $ 54 $ 107 K 47 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Flows Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 227 $ 243 $ 275 Net Cash Flows Investing Activities (GAAP) (182 ) (129 ) (126 ) Net Cash Flows Financing Activities (GAAP) (79 ) (174 ) (101 ) Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures (non GAAP)* 71 93 146 Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Required Payments on Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (non GAAP)* 32 54 107 * Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments, both non GAAP measures of liquidity, should not be considered as alternatives to Net Cash Flows Operating Activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity. We believe that Net Cash Flows after Capital Expenditures and Net Cash Flows Available after Required Payments provide useful information to investors as measures of liquidity and our ability to fund our capital requirements, make required payments on debt and capital lease obligations, and pay dividends to UniSource Energy. Liquidity Outlook As a result of growing capital expenditures, TEP may use its revolving credit facility on a more frequent basis. Other funding sources to meet the capital requirements from TEPs strong customer growth could include the issuance of long term debt as well as capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of TEPs rate related proceedings. Operating Activities In 2006, net cash flows from operating activities decreased by $16 million compared with the same period in 2005. Net cash flows were impacted by: 2006 included: a $28 million increase in cash receipts from electric retail and wholesale sales, net of fuel and purchased energy costs, due primarily to retail customer growth, higher availability of excess power to sell into the wholesale market; and the availability of Luna to offset some of TEPs purchased power requirements; and a $16 million decrease in total interest paid due to lower capital lease obligation balances, lower long term debt balances and lower annual fees under the TEP credit agreement that was entered into in May 2005 and amended in August 2006; a $20 million increase in other cash receipts due primarily to payments from Tri State for fees and the reimbursement of operating costs related to Springerville Unit 3; offset by a $42 million increase in income taxes paid due to a $31 million payment made to the IRS and state authorities related to a notice of a proposed adjustment to previously filed tax returns and an increase in federal and state extension and estimated tax payments; an $11 million increase in O&M costs due primarily to operating costs at Luna and higher generating plant maintenance costs; an $8 million decline in proceeds from the sale of excess emission allowances; a $4 million increase in taxes other than income taxes; and a $3 million increase in wages paid. 2005 included: $11 million of interest received from UniSource Energy related to an inter company note repaid in the first quarter of 2005. K 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities was $53 million higher in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to: a $9 million increase in proceeds from investments in Springerville Lease Debt; offset by a $6 million increase in capital expenditures related to TEPs share of the construction costs of Luna and growth and maintenance of TEPs electric system; and TEPs purchase of a 14% equity interest in Springerville Unit 1 Lease, which represents approximately 53 MW of capacity. Capital Expenditures TEPs forecasted capital expenditures are summarized below: Category 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars Transmission, Distribution and Other Facilities $ 144 $ 149 $ 120 $ 183 $ 184 Generation Facilities 36 47 67 33 98 Environmental 18 42 8 8 10 Total $ 198 $ 238 $ 195 $ 224 $ 292 Capital expenditures for TEP of $855 million for 2007 through 2010 are expected to be $216 million, or 34% higher than our 2005 forecast. This increase is the result of several factors including: strong customer growth; higher material and construction costs; the need to increase high voltage transmission capacity into TEPs service territory; the reinforcement and expansion of distribution lines; and environmental upgrades to generating facilities. These estimated expenditures include costs for TEP to comply with current federal and state environmental regulations. These estimates do not include the costs to construct the proposed Tucson to Nogales, Arizona transmission line. All of these estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment. Actual construction expenditures may be different from these estimates due to changes in business conditions, construction schedules, environmental requirements, and changes to TEPs business arising from retail competition. TEP plans to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash flow. Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line If all regulatory approvals are received, the future costs to construct the transmission line from Tucson to Nogales, Arizona is expected to be approximately $95 million. Through December 31, 2006, approximately $11 million in land acquisition, engineering and environmental expenses have been incurred on this project. If the required approvals are not received, TEP may be required to expense a portion of the costs that have been capitalized related to the project, propose alternative methods to the ACC for improving reliability and spend additional amounts to implement such alternatives. See Item 1. Business, Tucson Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. In addition to TEPs forecasted capital expenditures for construction, TEPs other capital requirements include its required debt maturities and capital lease obligations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities, and Capital Lease Obligations. Investments in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity At December 31, 2006, TEP had $181 million of investments in lease debt and equity on its balance sheet. The yields on TEPs investments in Springerville Lease Debt, at the date of purchase, range from 8.9% to 12.7%. The table below provides a summary of the investment balances in lease debt. K 49 Table of Contents Lease Debt Investment Balance Leased Asset December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 In Millions Investments in Lease Debt: Springerville Unit 1 $ 81 $ 91 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 52 65 Total Investment in Lease Debt $ 133 $ 156 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt, Credit Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations Financing Activities Net cash used for financing activities was $95 million lower in 2006 compared with 2005. The following factors contributed to the decrease: 2006 included: a $30 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility; offset by a $16 million increase in dividends paid to UniSource Energy; and an $8 million increase in scheduled payments made on capital lease obligations. 2005 included: a $110 million equity investment by UniSource Energy; and $95 million from UniSource Energy as a repayment for an inter company loan; offset by $282 million to repay long term debt; $5 million for debt issuance and retirement costs. At December 31, 2006, there were $30 million in outstanding borrowings under the TEP Revolving Credit Facility. TEP Credit Agreement In August 2006, TEP amended and restated its existing credit agreement (TEP Credit Agreement). The amendment reduced the interest rate and fees payable on TEPs borrowings and letters of credit, increased the amount of its revolving credit facility to $150 million from $60 million, and extended the maturity to August 2011 from May 2010. In addition to the revolving credit facility, the TEP Credit Agreement includes a $341 million letter of credit facility which supports $329 million of tax exempt variable rate bonds. The TEP Credit Agreement is secured by $491 million of 1992 Mortgage Bonds. Interest rates and fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 0.55% per annum and amounts drawn under a letter of credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum. TEP has the option of paying interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 0.55% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The TEP Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and sale leaseback agreements. The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP to meet a minimum cash coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement, it may pay dividends to UniSource Energy. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the TEP Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the TEP Credit Agreement; change in control, as defined; failure of TEP or certain subsidiaries to make payments or default on debt greater than $20 million; or certain bankruptcy events at TEP or certain subsidiaries. K 50 Table of Contents Springerville Common Facilities Leases In 1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one half ownership interest in the common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station. TEP refinanced the lease debt totaling $68 million in June 2006. Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The refinancing had no impact on the Springerville Common Facilities capital lease obligation or asset. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. The LIBOR rate in effect on December 31, 2006 was 5.63%, and 3.68% on December 31, 2005, which resulted in a total interest rate on the lease debt of 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. Inter Company Note from UniSource Energy In March 2005, UniSource Energy repaid to TEP a debt obligation in the principal amount of $95 million plus accrued interest of $11 million. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Capital Contribution from UniSource Energy In May 2005, UniSource Energy made a $110 million capital contribution to TEP. TEP used the proceeds during May 2005 to redeem or repurchase certain of its existing debt through tender offers and redemptions. See Bond Repurchases and Redemptions, below. Bond Repurchases and Redemptions TEP made a sinking fund payment of $1 million on its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs in January 2005. In March 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $31 million of its 6.1% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2008, as well as the remaining $21 million of its 7.5% 1941 Mortgage IDBs due in 2006. In May 2005, TEP used the proceeds from the repayment of the note from UniSource Energy and the capital contribution from UniSource Energy to purchase $147 million of its 1997 Pima Series B and $74 million of its 1997 Pima Series C fixed rate tax exempt bonds (Repurchased Bonds) at a price of $101.50 per $100 principal amount. In May 2005, TEP redeemed at par the remaining $4 million of bonds outstanding under those series. TEP does not currently plan on canceling the Repurchased Bonds, which will remain outstanding under their respective indentures; however, the Repurchased Bonds will not be presented in our financial statements. TEP may choose to resell the Repurchased Bonds to third parties or cancel them in the future. Mortgage Indentures In June 2005, TEP terminated its 1941 Mortgage (formerly known as its First Mortgage). TEPs remaining mortgage is its 1992 Mortgage (formerly known as its Second Mortgage). TEPs mortgage indenture creates a lien on and security interest in most of TEPs utility plant assets. Springerville Unit 2, which is owned by San Carlos, is not subject to this lien and security interest. TEPs mortgage indenture allows TEP to issue additional mortgage bonds on the basis of (1) a percentage of net utility property additions and or (2) the principal amount of retired mortgage bonds. The amount of bonds that TEP may issue is also subject to a net earnings test under the indenture. TEPs Credit Agreement, which totals $491 million and is secured by 1992 Mortgage Bonds, limits the amount of mortgage bonds that may be outstanding to no more than $840 million. At December 31, 2006, TEP had a total of $629 million in outstanding mortgage bonds, consisting of $491 million in bonds securing the TEP Credit Agreement, and $138 million in bonds securing the 7.50% Collateral Trust Bonds due in 2008. Although the 1992 Mortgage would allow TEP to issue additional bonds, the limit imposed by the TEP Credit Agreement is more restrictive and is currently the governing limitation. K 51 Table of Contents Tax Exempt Local Furnishing Bonds TEP has financed a substantial portion of utility plant assets with industrial development revenue bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authorities of Pima County and Apache County. The interest on these bonds is excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal tax purposes. This exclusion is allowed because the facilities qualify as facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. These bonds are sometimes referred to as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. To qualify for this exclusion, the facilities must be part of a system providing electric service to customers within not more than two contiguous counties. TEP provides electric service to retail customers in the City of Tucson and certain other portions of Pima County, Arizona and to Fort Huachuca in contiguous Cochise County, Arizona. TEP has financed the following facilities, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of tax exempt local furnishing bonds: Springerville Unit 2, Sundt Unit 4, a dedicated 345 kV transmission line from Springerville Unit 2 to TEPs retail service area (the Express Line), and a portion of TEPs local transmission and distribution system in the Tucson metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had approximately $359 million of tax exempt local furnishing bonds outstanding. Approximately $257 million in principal amount of such bonds financed Springerville Unit 2 and the Express Line. In addition, approximately $38 million of remaining lease debt related to the Sundt Unit 4 lease obligation was issued as tax exempt local furnishing bonds. Various events might cause TEP to have to redeem or defease some or all of these bonds: formation of an RTO or ISO; asset divestiture; changes in tax laws; or changes in system operations. TEP believes that its qualification as a local furnishing system should not be lost so long as (1) the RTO or ISO would not change the operation of the Express Line or the transmission facilities within TEPs local service area, (2) the RTO or ISO allows pricing of transmission service such that the benefits of tax exempt financing continue to accrue to retail customers, and (3) energy produced by Springerville Unit 2 and TEPs local generating units continues to be consumed in TEPs local service area. However, there is no assurance that such qualification can be maintained. Any redemption or defeasance of these bonds would likely require the issuance and sale of higher cost taxable debt securities in the same or a greater amount. Capital Lease Obligations At December 31, 2006, TEP had $647 million of total capital lease obligations on its balance sheet. The table below provides a summary of the outstanding lease amounts in each of the obligations. Leased Asset Capital Lease Obligation Balance at December 31, 2006 Expiration In Millions Springerville Unit 1 $381 2015 Springerville Coal Handling Facilities 112 2015 Springerville Common Facilities 107 2020 Sundt Unit 4 46 2011 Other Leases 1 2008 Total Capital Lease Obligations $647 Except for TEPs 14% equity ownership in the Springerville Unit 1 Leases and its 13% equity ownership in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, TEP will not own these assets at the expiration of the leases. TEP may renew the leases or purchase the leased assets at such time. The renewal and purchase options for Springerville Unit 1 and Sundt Unit 4 are generally for fair market value as determined at that time, while the purchase price option is fixed for the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Facilities. See UniSource Energy, Contractual Obligations, footnote (3), for more information about the fixed purchase price amounts.

We have no other commercial commitments to report. We have reviewed our contractual obligations and provide the following additional information: TEPs Credit Agreement contains pricing for its Revolving Credit Facility based on TEPs credit ratings. A change in TEPs credit ratings can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of interest TEP pays on its borrowings. TEPs Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants, including interest coverage and leverage tests. Failure to comply with these covenants would entitle the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with these covenants. See TEP Credit Agreement, above. TEP conducts its wholesale marketing and risk management activities under certain master agreements whereby TEP may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values, a change in TEPs credit ratings or if there has been a material change in TEPs creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, TEP has not been required to post such credit enhancement. Dividends on Common Stock TEP declared and paid dividends to UniSource Energy of $62 million in 2006, $46 million in 2005 and $32 million in 2004. TEP can pay dividends if it maintains compliance with the TEP Credit Agreement and certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2006, TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement. K 53 Table of Contents The Federal Power Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital accounts. Although the terms of the Federal Power Act are unclear, we believe that there is a reasonable basis to pay dividends from current year earnings. UNS GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UniSource Energy formed two operating companies, UNS Gas and UNS Electric, to acquire the Arizona electric and gas assets from Citizens in 2003, as well as an intermediate holding company, UES, to hold the common stock of UNS Gas and UNS Electric. UNS Gas reported net income of $4 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $6 million in 2004. We expect operations at UNS Gas to vary with the seasons, with peak energy usage occurring in the winter months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had approximately 145,000 retail customers, a 5% increase from last year. The table below shows UNS Gas therm sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Sales Revenues 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Therms Millions of Dollars Retail Therm Sales: Residential 70 69 71 $ 96 $ 79 $ 76 Commercial 30 29 29 38 29 28 Industrial 3 3 3 3 2 2 Public Authorities 7 7 7 8 7 6 Total Retail Therm Sales 110 108 110 145 117 112 Transport 23 27 3 3 3 Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) 17 21 21 12 16 12 Total Therm Sales 150 156 131 $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Through a Negotiated Sales Program (NSP) approved by the ACC, UNS Gas supplies natural gas to some of its large transportation customers. Approximately one half of the margin earned on these NSP sales is retained by UNS Gas while the remainder benefits retail customers through a credit to the Purchased Gas Adjustor (PGA) mechanism which reduces the gas commodity price. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. The table below provides summary financial information for UNS Gas. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Gas Revenues $ 160 $ 136 $ 127 Other Revenues 2 2 2 Total Operating Revenues 162 138 129 Purchased Energy Expense 114 91 82 Other Operations and Maintenance Expense 25 23 23 Depreciation and Amortization 7 7 5 Taxes other than Income Taxes 3 3 3 Total Other Operating Expenses 149 124 113 Operating Income 13 14 16 Total Other Income 1 Total Interest Expense 7 6 6 Income Tax Expense 3 3 4 Net Income $ 4 $ 5 $ 6 K 54 Table of Contents Retail therm sales were 2% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. In 2006, retail revenues increased $24 million and purchased energy expense increased $23 million, due primarily to the PGA surcharge increase, which became effective in November 2005. See Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Rates and Regulation Energy, Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism, below. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Gas retail rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including transportation, through a price adjustor. The difference between UNS Gas actual gas and transportation costs and the cost of gas and transportation recovered through base rates are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism. The PGA mechanism has two components, the PGA factor and the PGA surcharge or credit. The PGA factor is a mechanism that compares the twelve month rolling weighted average gas cost to the base cost of gas, and automatically adjusts monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve month period. The actual gas and transportation costs that are either under or over collected through the base rate of $0.40 per therm or $4.00 per MMBtu and the PGA factor are charged or credited to a balancing account (PGA bank). In the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, the average PGA factor was approximately $0.33 per therm or $3.33 per MMBtu. The current annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor is $0.10 per therm in a twelve month period. As part of its general rate case proceeding with the ACC, UNS Gas requested to remove the cap to allow for more timely recovery of actual gas costs. See General Rate Case Filing, below. When the ACC designated under or over recovery trigger points of $6.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge or credit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount deferred from or to customers over a period deemed appropriate by the ACC. On December 31, 2006, the PGA bank balance was over collected by $2 million on the basis as billed to customers. In December 2006, the ACC approved a proposal by UNS Gas that lowered the PGA surcharge to $0.05 per therm. The $0.05 per therm PGA surcharge will remain in effect through April 2007. Based on current projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the lower surcharge amount will allow it to timely recover its gas costs and still provide rate relief to its customers. Changes in the market price for gas, sales volumes and surcharge amount could significantly change the PGA bank balance in the future. General Rate Case Filing UNS Gas current rates have been in place since August 2003 and were designed to provide a 9.05% return on original cost rate base of $118 million. As a result of increased growth in UNS Gas service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Gas to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In July 2006, UNS Gas filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Gas request: Test year Year ended December 31, 2005 Original cost rate base $162 million Revenue deficiency $10 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 7% Cost of debt 6.60% Cost of equity 11.00% Hypothetical capital structure 50% equity / 50% debt Weighted average cost of capital 8.80% K 55 Table of Contents UNS Gas also requested modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems posed by volatile gas prices, inappropriate price signals to customers and the potential for over or under collections to result in the accumulation of large bank balances. In February 2007, ACC staff filed testimony that indicated a revenue deficiency for UNS Gas of approximately $5 million; RUCOs testimony indicated a revenue deficiency of approximately $2 million. The procedural schedule for the UNS Gas rate case is as follows: Filing Date UNS Gas rebuttal testimony March 9, 2007 ACC Staff & intervenor rebuttal testimony March 30, 2007 UNS Gas rejoinder testimony April 6, 2007 Hearing before ALJ April 16, 2007 UNS Gas expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in the second half of 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Gas capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $23 million. UNS Gas expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a large portion of its construction expenditures. If natural gas prices rise and UNS Gas is not allowed to recover its projected gas costs or PGA bank balance on a timely basis, UNS Gas may require additional funding to meet operating and capital requirements. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contribution from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Gas general rate case that was filed in July 2006. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 32 $ 14 $ 21 Capital Expenditures 23 23 19 Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Gas are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Gas $38 $33 $27 $28 $26 UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver In August 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric amended and restated their existing unsecured revolving credit agreement (UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver). The amendment reduced the interest rate payable on borrowings and, upon ACC approval, will increase the amount of the revolving credit facility to $60 million from $40 million, and extend the maturity from April 2008 to August 2011. Currently, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $30 million, but the total combined amount borrowed cannot exceed $40 million. Upon ACC approval of the increase in the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, either borrower may borrow up to a maximum of $45 million so long as the combined amount borrowed does not exceed $60 million. The matter is pending before the ACC. UNS Gas is only liable for UNS Gas borrowings, and similarly, UNS Electric is only liable for UNS Electrics borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. UES guarantees the obligations of both UNS Gas and UNS Electric. K 56 Table of Contents UNS Gas and UNS Electric have the option of paying interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% or the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the agent banks reference rate. The UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver contains restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, mergers and sales of assets; it also contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for each borrower. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas and UNS Electric were each in compliance with the terms of the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. If an event of default occurs, the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver may become immediately due and payable. An event of default includes failure to make required payments under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver, certain change in control transactions, certain bankruptcy events of UNS Gas or UNS Electric, or failure of UES, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to make payments or default on debt greater than $4 million. UNS Gas expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. As of February 23, 2007, UNS Gas had no outstanding borrowings under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Gas has $100 million of senior unsecured notes outstanding consisting of $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2011 and $50 million of 6.23% Notes due in 2015 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas restricts transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens, restricted payments and incurrence of indebtedness, and also contains a minimum net worth test. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Gas must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Gas may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $7 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Gas Supply Contracts UNS Gas has a natural gas supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company (BP). Under the contract, BP manages UNS Gas existing supply and transportation contracts and its incremental requirements. The initial term of the agreement expired in August 2005. The agreement was automatically extended one year and will continue to extend on an annual basis unless either party provides 180 days notice of its intent to terminate. No termination notice has been tendered by either party. Prices for incremental gas supplied by BP will vary based upon the market prices for the period during which the gas is delivered. UNS Gas hedges its gas supply prices by entering into fixed price forward contracts at various times during the year to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of hedging at least 45% of the expected monthly gas consumption with fixed prices prior to entering into the month. UNS Gas hedged approximately 48% of its expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March). Additionally, UNS Gas has approximately 36% of its expected gas consumption hedged for April through October 2007, and 29% hedged for the period November 2007 through March 2008. UNS Gas has firm transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) with combined capacity sufficient to meet its load requirements. UNS Gas currently has a transportation agreement with EPNG to serve its Northern and Southern Arizona service territories. This agreement has specific contract volumes in each month and specific receipt point rights from the available supply basins (San Juan and Permian). The average daily capacity rights of UNS Gas is approximately 655,000 therms per day, with an average of 1,095,000 therms per day in the winter season (November through March). EPNG filed a rate case in 2005 with new, higher rates effective in January 2006, subject to refund. The rate case participants reached a negotiated settlement and filed an agreement with FERC on December 6, 2006. FERC is expected to take action on the settlement agreement in the first half of 2007. UNS Gas contract with EPNG expires in August 2011, with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. K 57 Table of Contents UNS Gas has capacity rights of 250,000 therms per day on the San Juan Lateral and Mainline of the Transwestern pipeline. The Transwestern pipeline principally delivers gas to the portion of UNS Gas distribution system serving customers in Flagstaff and Kingman, Arizona, and also delivers gas to UNS Gas facilities serving the Griffith Power Plant in Mohave County. The current contract with Transwestern expires in February 2007. UNS Gas entered into a new firm transportation contract with Transwestern through February 2012 with rights of first refusal for continuation thereafter. The new capacity rights under this agreement are: 250,000 therms per day October through April; 15,000 therms per day in May; and 10,000 therms per day June through September. Transwestern filed a rate case in October 2006 with new, higher rates to be effective in April 2007. The rate case participants are attempting to negotiate a settlement prior to the new rates becoming effective. The aggregate annual minimum transportation charges are expected to be approximately $9 million and $2 million for the EPNG and Transwestern contracts, respectively. These costs are passed through to our customers via the PGA. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Gas contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Gas may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Gas will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures. UNS ELECTRIC RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNS Electric reported net income of $5 million in 2006 and 2005, and $4 million in 2004. Similar to TEPs operations, we expect UNS Electrics operations to be seasonal in nature, with peak energy demand occurring in the summer months. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had approximately 93,000 retail customers, a 4% increase from last year. Retail kWh sales were 6% higher in 2006 due primarily to customer growth. The table below shows UNS Electrics kWh sales and revenues for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The plan addressed all aspects of implementation. It included UNS Electrics unbundled distribution tariffs for both standard offer customers and customers that choose competitive retail access, as well as Direct Access and Settlement Fee schedules. UNS Electrics direct access rates for both transmission and ancillary services would be based upon its FERC Open Access Transmission Tariff. The plan is subject to review and approval by the ACC, which has not yet considered the plan. As a result of the court decisions concerning the ACCs Rules, we are unable to predict when and how the ACC will address this plan. See Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Competition, above for information regarding the Arizona Court of Appeals decision. Rates Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism UNS Electrics retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit to the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under or over recovery of costs. The ACC has approved a PPFAC surcharge of $0.01825 per kWh to recover transmission costs and the cost of the current full requirements power supply agreement with PWMT. General Rate Case Filing UNS Electrics retail rates were last adjusted in August 2003. As a result of increased growth in UNS Electrics service territory and the related increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, such current rates are inadequate for UNS Electric to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment. In December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case. Below is a table that summarizes UNS Electrics request: Test year 12 months ended June 30, 2006 Original cost rate base $141 million Revenue deficiency $8.5 million Total rate increase (over test year revenues) 5.5% Cost of long term debt 8.2% Cost of equity 11.8% Actual capital structure 49% equity / 51% debt Weighted average cost of capital 9.9% K 59 Table of Contents The procedural schedule for the UNS Electric rate case is as follows: Filing Date ACC Staff and Intervenor testimony June 28, 2007 UNS Electric rebuttal testimony August 14, 2007 ACC Staff and Intervenor surrebuttal August 24, 2007 UNS Electric rejoinder testimony August 31, 2007 Hearing before ALJ September 10, 2007 UNS Electric also requested the ACC to approve the acquisition of the 90 MW BMGS combustion turbine project under development by UED with a post test year rate base adjustment effective June 1, 2008. The cost of the BMGS is expected to cost $60 million. UNS Electric expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in late 2007. Under the terms of the UES Settlement Agreement, new rates cannot go into effect before August 1, 2007. UNS Electric also requested that a new PPFAC surcharge take effect when the current power supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008. Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff See, Tucson Electric Power Company, Factors Affecting Results of Operations, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Outlook UNS Electrics capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In 2006, capital expenditures were $39 million. UNS Electric expects internal cash flows to fund its future operating activities and a portion of its construction expenditures. Sources of funding future capital expenditures could include draws on the revolving credit facility, additional credit lines, the issuance of long term debt, or capital contributions from UniSource Energy. The need for external funding sources is partially dependent on the outcome of UNS Electrics general rate case that was filed in December 2006. In June 2006, UniSource Energy contributed $10 million of capital to UNS Electric. Operating Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures The table below provides summary information for operating cash flow and capital expenditures. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Cash Flows Operating Activities $ 14 $ 21 $ 19 Capital Expenditures 39 30 19 To improve the reliability of service in Santa Cruz County, UNS Electric completed a 20 MW gas fired combustion turbine at the Valencia site in 2006, and plans to upgrade its existing 115 kV transmission line over time. The turbine improves reliability while the approval and permitting process for the 345 kV Tucson to Nogales transmission line continues. In 2006, UNS Electrics capital expenditures included $7 million related to the turbine. See Item 1. Business, TEP Electric Utility Operations, Transmission Access, Tucson to Nogales Transmission Line. Forecasted capital expenditures for UNS Electric are as follows: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Millions of Dollars UNS Electric $43 $40 $42 $27 $34 K 60 Table of Contents UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver See UNS Gas, Liquidity and Capital Resources, UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver above for description of UNS Electrics unsecured revolving credit agreement. UNS Electric expects to draw upon the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver from time to time for seasonal working capital purposes and to fund a portion of its capital expenditures. At February 23, 2007, UNS Electric had $25 million outstanding under the UNS Gas/UNS Electric Revolver. Senior Unsecured Notes UNS Electric has $60 million of 7.61% senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2008 that are guaranteed by UES. The note purchase agreements for UNS Electric contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates, mergers, liens to secure indebtedness, restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness, and minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric was in compliance with the terms of its note purchase agreement. UNS Electric must meet a leverage test and an interest coverage test to issue additional debt or to pay dividends. However, UNS Electric may, without meeting these tests, refinance existing debt and incur up to $5 million in short term debt. Contractual Obligations UNS Electric Power Supply and Transmission Contracts UNS Electric has a full requirements power supply agreement with Pinnacle West Marketing and Trading (PWMT), which expires in May 2008. The agreement obligates PWMT to supply all of UNS Electrics power requirements at a fixed price per MWh. Payments under the contract are usage based, with no fixed customer or demand charges. UNS Electric is in the process of securing replacement energy resources when its supply contract ends with PWMT in 2008. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $27 million. The new UNS Electric power purchase contracts are subject to master agreements whereby UNS Electric may be required to post margin due to changes in contract values or if there has been a material change in creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had not been required to post such credit enhancement. UNS Electric imports the power it purchases over the Western Area Power Administrations (WAPA) transmission lines. UNS Electrics transmission capacity agreements with WAPA provide for annual rate adjustments and expire in February 2008 and June 2011. The contract that expires in 2008 also contains a capacity adjustment clause. Under the terms of the agreements, UNS Electrics aggregated minimum fixed transmission charges are expected to be $12 million in 2007 through 2011. UNS Electric made payments under these contracts of $8 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2005. Dividends on Common Stock The note purchase agreement for UNS Electric contains restrictions on dividends. UNS Electric may pay dividends so long as (a) no default or event of default exists and (b) it could incur additional debt under the debt incurrence test. See Senior Unsecured Notes, above. It is unlikely, however, that UNS Electric will pay dividends in the next few years due to expected cash requirements for capital expenditures.

UED In 2006, UED purchased two electric generating turbines for $17 million. The turbines will be part of the 90 MW BMGS, to be constructed in Kingman, Arizona, and, pending ACC approval is expected to provide energy to UNS Electric. Construction is planned to begin during the third quarter of 2007 with an estimated completion date of May 2008. Including the purchase of the turbines, the total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $60 million. UED is financing the BMGS project with borrowings from UniSource Energy under an inter company note payable. At December 31, 2006, there was $22 million outstanding and interest is payable quarterly at LIBOR plus 1.25%. In 2005, UED had no significant operations. In 2004, UED recognized an impairment loss on its note receivable from an independent power producer. As UEDs recovery of the note receivable from the entity is subordinated to the rights of others, UED wrote off the entire $2 million balance due on the note at the time that Haddington, an investor in the independent power producer, determined that its investment was impaired. In 2004, UEDs net loss was $1 million. Discontinued Operations Global Solar Global Solar recorded losses of $2 million in 2006, $5 million in 2005 and $5 million in 2004. On March 31, 2006, Millennium completed the sale of its interest in Global Solar. In these financial statements, UniSource Energy accounts for Global Solar as a discontinued operation and recognizes 100% of Global Solars losses. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Millennium Investments MEG is in the process of winding down its activities and does not expect to engage in any significant new activities. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of MEGs trading assets was $11 million and the fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million. Nations Energy Corporation (Nations Energy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, has been inactive since 2001. As of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, Nations Energy had a deferred tax asset of $3 million related to investment losses that has not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax return. K 62 Table of Contents Millennium is in the process of exiting its remaining investments. At December 31, 2006, the book value of Millenniums investments was $28 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Millennium made a $5 million dividend payment to UniSource Energy in February 2007 and is expected to make additional dividend payments totaling $10 million to UniSource Energy during the first half of 2007. In 2006, Millennium funded $2 million to Haddington under an existing commitment. In 2005, Haddington sold one of its investments and Millennium received a $6 million distribution related to the sale. In 2004, Millennium received a $7 million distribution from Haddington related to the gain on a sale of one of its investments. Millenniums remaining commitment is $1 million to Valley Ventures. In 2006, Millennium received the remaining payment of $5 million on a note receivable from a subsidiary of Mirant Corporation and, in 2005, received a payment of $4 million. Millennium funded the remainder of its commitment to IPS in 2006. Millennium owns less than 10% of the equity of IPS. In 2005, Millennium received a $4 million payment from its investment in Carboelectrica Sabinas, S. de R.L. de C.V., (Sabinas) a Mexican limited liability company. The $4 million payment was treated as the return of capital and the book value of the investment in Sabinas was reduced to approximately $14 million. Millennium owns 50% of Sabinas. A $2 million payment due to Millennium in June 2006 was cancelled in exchange for payment by Mimosa, an affiliate of Sabinas, for up to $2 million to obtain a valuation of the interest in coal reserves and associated gas held by Mimosa. This evaluation is being performed under Millenniums direction, primarliy to determine the impact of current regulatory changes in Mexico on the value of the Sabinas investment. We expect the evaluation to be completed in 2007. UniSource Energy has ceased making loans or equity contributions to Millennium. We anticipate that the funding required to fund Millenniums remaining commitments will be provided only out of existing Millennium cash or cash returns from Millennium investments. We believe such cash and returns will be adequate to fund Millenniums remaining commitments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions. UniSource Energy and TEP consider Critical Accounting Estimates to be those that could result in materially different financial statement results if our assumptions regarding application of accounting principles were different. UniSource Energy and TEP describe their Critical Accounting Estimates below. Other significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates. Accounting for Rate Regulation TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric generally use the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (FAS 71), require special accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP, UNS Gas or UNS Electric to currently charge their customers to recover certain expenses, but instead may require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71 requires that TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are allowed to charge their customers. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then amortize these items as expense to the income statement as these charges are recovered from customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced. The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of FAS 71 include: an independent regulator sets rates; the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering service; and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator. K 63 Table of Contents TEP Upon approval by the ACC of a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) in November 1999, TEP discontinued application of FAS 71 for its generation operations. TEP continues to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations, which include the transmission and distribution portions of its business. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $118 million at December 31, 2006. Regulatory assets of $61 million are not presently included in the rate base and consequently are not earning a return on investment. These regulatory assets are being recovered through the cost of service or are authorized to be collected in future base rates. TEPs transmission and distribution regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities, totaled $163 million at December 31, 2005. TEP regularly assesses whether it can continue to apply FAS 71 to its cost based rate regulated operations. If TEP stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write off the related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory liabilities as income on its income statement. Based on the regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2006, if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would have recorded an extraordinary after tax loss of approximately $71 million. While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect cash flows, TEPs cash flows would not be affected if it stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited its ability to recover the cost of its regulatory assets. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $13 million at December 31, 2006 compared with regulatory assets, net of regulatory liabilities of $3 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electrics regulatory liabilities, net of regulatory assets, totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006 and $7 million at December 31, 2005. UNS Electric has $11 million of regulatory liabilities and $1 million of regulatory assets that are not included in rate base. UNS Gas and UNS Electric regularly assess whether they can continue to apply FAS 71 to their cost based rate regulated operations. If UNS Gas and UNS Electric stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, they would write off the related balances of regulatory assets as an expense and regulatory liabilities as income on their income statements. Based on the balances of regulatory liabilities and assets at December 31, 2006, if UNS Gas and UNS Electric had stopped applying FAS 71 to their regulated operations, UNS Gas would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $8 million and UNS Electric would record an extraordinary after tax gain of $7 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electrics cash flows would not be affected if they stopped applying FAS 71 unless a regulatory order limited their ability to recover the cost of their regulatory assets. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, issued by the FASB, requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred. A legal obligation is a liability that a party is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or contract. A legal obligation can also be associated with the retirement of a long lived asset whose timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event. We are required to record a conditional asset retirement obligation at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity should capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. Over time, the liability is adjusted to its present value by recognizing accretion expense as an operating expense in the income statement each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the recorded amount. TEP In 2005, TEP implemented FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). The implementation of FIN 47 required TEP to update an existing inventory, originally created for the implementation of FAS 143, and to determine which, if any, of the conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated. The ability to reasonably estimate conditional asset retirement obligations was a matter of management judgment, based upon managements ability to estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, a method or potential method of settlement and probabilities associated with the potential dates and methods of settlement of TEPs conditional asset retirement obligations. In determining whether its conditional asset retirement obligations could be reasonably estimated, management considered TEPs past practices, industry practices, managements intent and the estimated economic life of the assets. The fair value of the K 64 Table of Contents conditional asset retirement obligations were then estimated using an expected present value technique. Changes in managements assumptions regarding settlement dates, settlement methods or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liability recorded by TEP at December 31, 2006 as well as the associated cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded. The liabilities associated with conditional asset retirement obligations will be adjusted on an ongoing basis due to the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or amount of the original estimates of undiscounted cash flows. These adjustments could have a significant impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. For more information regarding the implementation and ongoing application of FIN 47, see Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Accounting Change: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Prior to implementing FAS 143, costs for final removal of all owned generation facilities were accrued as an additional component of depreciation expense. Under FAS 143, only the costs to remove an asset with legally binding retirement obligations will be accrued over time through accretion of the asset retirement obligation and depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had a liability of $4 million associated with its final asset retirement obligations. TEP has identified legal obligations to retire generation plant assets specified in land leases for its jointly owned Navajo and Four Corners Generating Stations. The land on which these stations reside is leased from the Navajo Nation. The provisions of the leases require the lessees to remove the facilities upon request of the Navajo Nation at the expiration of the leases. TEP also has certain environmental obligations at the San Juan Generating Station. TEP has estimated that its share of the cost to remove the Navajo and Four Corners facilities and settle the San Juan environmental obligations will be approximately $40 million at the date of retirement. No other legal obligations to retire generation plant assets were identified. In 2004, TEP, Phelps Dodge Energy Services, LLC and PNM Resources, Inc. each purchased from Duke Energy North America, LLC a one third interest in a limited liability company which owns the natural gas fired Luna Energy Facility (Luna) in Southern New Mexico. Luna is a 570 MW combined cycle plant and was placed into commercial operation in April 2006. See Item 1. Business, Future Generating Resources TEP. The new owners assumed asset retirement obligations to remove certain piping and evaporation ponds and to restore the ground to its original condition. TEP has estimated its share to settle the obligations will be approximately $2 million at the date of retirement. TEP has various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. TEP operates its transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, TEP is not recognizing the costs of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, TEP had accrued $80 million for the net cost of removal for the interim retirements from its transmission, distribution and general plant. As of December 31, 2005, TEP had accrued $75 million for these removal costs. The amount is recorded as a regulatory liability. Amounts recorded under FAS 143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, estimating when final removal will occur, and the credit adjusted risk free interest rates to be used to discount future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change amounts recorded in the future as expense for asset retirement obligations. If TEP retires any asset at the end of its useful life, without a legal obligation to do so, it will record retirement costs at that time as incurred or accrued. TEP does not believe that the implementation of FAS 143 will result in any change in retail rates since all matters relating to the rate making treatment of TEPs generating assets have been determined pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric have various transmission and distribution lines that operate under land leases and rights of way that contain end dates and restorative clauses. UNS Gas and UNS Electric operate their transmission and distribution lines as if they will be operated in perpetuity and would continue to be used or sold without land remediation. As a result, UNS Gas and UNS Electric are not recognizing the cost of final removal of the transmission and distribution lines in the financial statements. K 65 Table of Contents For the net cost of removal for interim retirements from transmission, distribution and general plant, UNS Gas accrued $4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $3 million as of December 31, 2005. UNS Electric accrued $2 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1 million as of December 31, 2005. The amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assumptions We record plan assets, obligations, and expenses related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions on discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries. TEP As a result of adopting FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in December 2006, TEP recognized the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a liability. The underfunded status was measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit plans. We expect volatility in the liability recognized in the balance sheet in future years as the funded status of our plans can change significantly due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience. The adjustment required to recognize the pension liability on adoption of this statement resulted in (i) recognition of a regulatory asset of $32 million representing a reasonable appropriation of the actuarial losses and prior service costs of TEPs pension plans that are probable of recovery in rates by its regulated operations in future periods and (ii) an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $17 million for our unregulated operations. We recorded the required increase in our other postretirement benefit obligation as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8 million as the ACC allows TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to recover other postretirement costs through rates only as benefit payments are made. Any change in the funded status of our plans due to discount rate changes and investment and actuarial experience will be recognized as an adjustment to regulatory assets and other comprehensive income. TEP discounted its future pension plan obligations at 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP discounted its other postretirement plan obligations at a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, and 5.8% at December 31, 2005. TEP determines the discount rate annually based on the rates currently available on high quality, non callable, long term bonds. TEP looks to bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency whose future cash flows match the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. For TEPs pension plans, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $7 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. A similar increase in the discount rate would decrease the PBO by approximately $8 million and the 2007 plan expense by approximately $1 million. For TEPs other postretirement benefit plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $2 million. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact plan expense by approximately $0.1 million. TEP calculates the market related value of plan assets using the fair value of plan assets on the measurement date. TEP assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 8.3% at December 31, 2006 and 8.5% at December 31, 2005. In establishing its assumption as to the expected return on plan assets, TEP reviews the plans asset allocation and develops return assumptions for each asset class based on advice from an investment consultant and the plans actuary that includes both historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets. Pension expense decreases as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases. A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact pension expense in 2007 by less than $0.5 million. TEP used an initial health care cost trend rate of 9.0% in valuing its postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2006. This rate reflects both market conditions and the plans experience. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A 1% increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $5 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. A similar decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $4 million and the related plan expense in 2007 by less than $1 million. TEP will record pension expense of approximately $9 million and other postretirement benefit expense of $5 million ratably through 2007. TEP will make required pension plan K 66 Table of Contents contributions of $10 million in 2007. TEPs other postretirement benefit plan is not funded. TEP expects to make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $3 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted their future pension plan obligations using a rate of 5.9% at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. For UNS Gas and UNS Electrics pension plan, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would impact the benefit obligation and pension expense by less than $0.5 million. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record pension expense of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will make a pension plan contribution of $1 million in 2007. UNS Gas and UNS Electric discounted its other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of 5.6% at December 31, 2006, compared with 5.8% at December 31, 2005. UNS Gas and UNS Electric will record postretirement medical benefit expense and make benefit payments to retirees under the postretirement benefit plan of approximately $0.1 million in 2007. Accounting for Derivative Instruments, Trading Activities and Hedging Activities A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from another investment or designated benchmark. TEP enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time, typically for one month, three months, or one year, within established limits to take advantage of favorable market opportunities. In general, TEP enters into forward purchase contracts when market conditions provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources (e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods). TEP enters into forward sales contracts when it forecasts that it has excess supply and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost. A portion of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales and, therefore, are not required to be marked to market. However, some of these forward contracts are considered to be derivatives, which TEP marks to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. However, some of these forward contracts which are derivatives satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Common Stock Equity, rather than being reflected in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments can be accounted for under multiple methods depending upon facts and circumstances, which can lead to variability in earnings. TEP has a natural gas supply agreement, that expires in February 2007, under which it purchases its gas requirements for its generating units located in Tucson, Arizona at spot market prices. TEP also has agreements to purchase power that are priced using spot market gas prices. These contracts meet the definition of normal purchases and are not required to be marked to market. In an effort to minimize price risk on these purchases, TEP enters into commodity price swap agreements under which TEP purchases gas at fixed prices and simultaneously sells gas at spot market prices. The spot market price in the swap agreements is tied to the same index as the purchases under the natural gas supply and purchased power contracts. These swap agreements, which expire during the summer months through 2009, were entered into with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of TEPs expected summer monthly gas risk prior to entering into the month. The swap agreements are marked to market on a monthly basis; however, since the agreements satisfy the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income rather than being reflected in the income statement. In June 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap in order to reduce the risk associated with unfavorable changes in variable interest rate payments related to changes in LIBOR. The swap has the effect of converting approximately $37 million of variable rate lease payments for the Springerville Common Lease to a fixed rate. The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the interest rate swap is derived from models based on well recognized financial principles, which provide a reasonable approximation of the fair value of the swap as of the valuation date. Other models can be used to estimate the fair value of the swap and these models, which may use different assumptions or methods, may yield different results. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the swap is a liability of $2 million. TEP manages the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standardized agreement, which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. UNS Gas does not currently have any contracts that are required to be marked to market. UNS Gas does have a natural gas supply and management agreement under which it purchases substantially all of its gas requirements K 67 Table of Contents at market prices from BP Energy Company (BP). However, the contract terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its gas purchases by entering into fixed price forward contracts with BP at various times during the year. This enables UNS Gas to provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to three years in advance with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45% and not more than 80% of the expected monthly gas consumption prior to entering into the month. These forward contracts, as well as the main gas supply contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and therefore are not required to be marked to market. UNS Electric presently has a full requirements power supply agreement that enables it to meet its load. The agreement expires May 31, 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. In order to reduce exposure to energy price risk resulting from the procurement of power, UNS Electric has entered into forward power purchase contracts for specified amounts of energy at specified prices over a given period of time, within established limits. UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts meet the definition of a derivative and are marked to market by recording unrealized gains or losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In December 2006, the ACC issued an order allowing UNS Electric to record the unrealized net gains or losses as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. MEG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium, enters into swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to Emission Allowances. MEG marks its trading contracts to market by recording unrealized gains and losses and adjusting the related assets and liabilities on a monthly basis to reflect the market prices at the end of the month. In accordance with UniSource Energys intention to cease making capital contributions to Millennium, Millennium has significantly reduced the holdings and activity of MEG. MEGs activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. The market prices used to determine fair values for TEP, UNS Electric and MEGs derivative instruments at December 31, 2006, are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes, exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value. For TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized net losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. For MEGs remaining trading contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $0.1 million. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG). To date, the DIG has issued more than 100 interpretations to provide guidance in applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133). As the DIG or the FASB continues to issue interpretations, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric may change the conclusions they have reached and, as a result, the accounting treatment and financial statement impact could change in the future. See Market Risks Commodity Price Risk in Item 7A. K 68 Table of Contents Unbilled Revenue TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric TEPs, UNS Gass and UNS Electrics retail revenues include an estimate of MWhs/therms delivered but unbilled at the end of each period. Unbilled revenues are dependent upon a number of factors that require managements judgment including estimates of retail sales and customer usage patterns. The unbilled revenue is estimated by comparing the estimated MWhs/therms delivered to the MWhs/therms billed to TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric retail customers. The excess of estimated MWhs/therms delivered over MWhs/therms billed is then allocated to the retail customer classes based on estimated usage by each customer class. TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric then record revenue for each customer class based on the various bill rates for each customer class. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of TEPs actual load, the unbilled revenue amount increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. The unbilled revenue amount for UNS Gas sales increases during the fall and winter months and decreases during the spring and summer months, whereas, the unbilled revenue amount for UNS Electric sales increases during the spring and summer months and decreases during the fall and winter months. Plant Asset Depreciable Lives TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric We calculate depreciation expense based on our estimate of the useful lives of our plant assets. The estimated useful lives, and resulting depreciation rates used to calculate depreciation expense for the transmission and distribution businesses of TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have been approved by the ACC in prior rate decisions. Depreciation rates for transmission and distribution cannot be changed without ACC approval. The estimated remaining useful lives of TEPs generating facilities are based on managements best estimate of the economic life of the units. These estimates are based on engineering estimates, economic analysis, and statistical analysis of TEPs past experience in maintaining the stations. Our generation assets are currently depreciated over periods ranging from 23 to 70 years from the original in service dates. During the second quarter of 2005, a study requested by the participants in the San Juan Generating Station was completed which indicated San Juans economic useful life had changed from previous estimates. As a result of the study and other analysis performed, TEP lengthened the estimated useful life of San Juan from 40 to 60 years beginning April 1, 2005. TEPs annual depreciation expense related to San Juan decreased by $6 million as a result. During the first quarter of 2004, TEP engaged an independent third party to review the economic estimated useful lives of its owned generating assets in Springerville, Arizona. TEP then hired another independent third party to perform a depreciation study for its generation assets, taking into consideration the newly determined economic useful life for the Springerville assets, and changes in generation plant life information used by the operators and other participants of the joint power plants in which TEP participates. As a result of these analyses, TEP lengthened the useful lives of various generation assets for periods ranging from 11 to 22 years in July 2004. Consequently, depreciation rates and the corresponding depreciation expense have been revised prospectively to reflect the life extensions. The annual impact of these changes in depreciation rates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $9 million. Deferred Tax Valuation We record deferred tax liabilities for amounts that will increase income taxes on future tax returns. We record deferred tax assets for amounts that could be used to reduce income taxes on future tax returns. We record a valuation allowance, or reserve, for the deferred tax asset amount that we may not be able to use on future tax returns. We estimate the valuation allowance based on our interpretation of the tax rules, prior tax audits, tax planning strategies, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and projected future taxable income. At December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy had no valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, UniSource Energy had a valuation allowance of $7 million relating to net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amounts. The $7 million valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2005, relates to losses generated by the Millennium entities. As a result of the sale of Global Solar, the NOL and related valuation allowance were removed from the UniSource Energy consolidated balance sheet. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, UniSource Energys deferred income tax assets include $7 million and $9 million, respectively, related to unregulated investment losses of Millennium. These losses have not been reflected on UniSource Energys consolidated income tax returns. If UniSource Energy were unable to K 69 Table of Contents recognize such losses through its consolidated income tax return in the foreseeable future, UniSource Energy would be required to write off these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, TEP had no valuation allowance. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The FASB recently issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), FASB Interpretations (FIN), FASB Staff Positions (FSP), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issues (EITF): EITF 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation), approved June 2006, requires that we disclose our accounting policy regarding presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. Additionally, we must disclose the amounts of any taxes reported on a gross basis in interim and annual financial statements. EITF 06 3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our disclosures. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS 109, issued July 2006, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 requires disclosure of a rollforward of total unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. TEP recognized between $1 million and $2 million of income as an increase to Common Stock Equity on January 1, 2007 on the adoption of FIN 48. FAS 157, Fair Value Measurement, issued September 2006, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 clarifies that the exchange price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. We are required to disclose inputs used to develop fair value measurements and the effect of any of our assumptions on earnings or changes in net assets for the period. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our financial statements, and will incorporate these additional disclosure requirements in our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. FSP AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, issued September 2006, prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. As we do not accrue planned major maintenance activities in advance, we anticipate no impact on our financial statements from the adoption of this FSP. FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, issued September 2006, requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and benefit obligation. FAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the incremental effect of adopting FAS 158. In the third quarter of 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law, which will be effective January 1, 2008. The new law will affect the manner in which many companies, including UniSource Energy and TEP, administer their pension plans. The legislation will require companies to increase the amount by which they fund their pension plans, increase premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for defined benefit plans, amend plan documents and provide additional disclosures in regulatory filings and to plan participants. We are currently assessing the impact it may have on our financial statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks We are exposed to various forms of market risk. Changes in interest rates, returns on marketable securities, and changes in commodity prices may affect our future financial results. K 71 Table of Contents For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements, above. Risk Management Committee We have a Risk Management Committee responsible for the oversight of commodity price risk and credit risk related to the wholesale energy marketing activities of TEP, the emissions and trading activities of MEG, and the fuel and power procurement activities at TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric. Our Risk Management Committee, which meets on a quarterly basis and as needed, consists of officers from the finance, accounting, legal, wholesale marketing, transmission and distribution operations, and the generation operations departments of UniSource Energy. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to commodity price risk, the Risk Management Committee sets trading and hedging policies and limits, which are reviewed frequently to respond to constantly changing market conditions. To limit TEP, UNS Gas, UNS Electric and MEGs exposure to credit risk, the Risk Management Committee reviews counterparty credit exposure as well as credit policies and limits. Interest Rate Risk TEP is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in interest rates on certain of its variable rate debt obligations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEPs debt included $329 million of tax exempt variable rate debt. The average interest rate on TEPs variable rate debt (excluding letter of credit fees) was 3.47% in 2006 and 2.48% in 2005. In June 2006, TEP refinanced variable rate lease debt totaling $68 million related to its Springerville Common Facilities Leases. The notes underlying the leases mature in June 2017 and January 2020. The notes were amended to provide that interest will be payable at LIBOR plus 1.5% for the next three years with the spread over LIBOR increasing every three years thereafter to 2% by June 2018. Prior to the refinancing, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%. The interest rate in effect on the lease debt was 7.13% at December 31, 2006, and 7.68% at December 31, 2005. A 1% increase (decrease) in average interest rates would result in a decrease (increase) in TEPs pre tax income by approximately $4 million. A portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the floating rate lease debt. On June 8, 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this debt. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate portion of rent at 7.27% on $37 million of the lease debt. Marketable Securities Risk TEP is exposed to fluctuations in the return on its marketable securities, which is comprised of investments in debt securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, TEP had marketable debt securities with an estimated fair value of $139 million and $165 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6 million and $9 million, respectively. These debt securities represent TEPs investments in lease debt underlying certain of TEPs capital lease obligations. Changes in the fair value of such debt securities do not present a material risk to TEP, as TEP intends to hold these investments to maturity. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas, coal and emission allowances. TEP Purchases and Sales of Energy To manage its exposure to energy price risk, TEP enters into forward contracts to buy or sell energy at a specified price and future delivery period. Generally, TEP commits to future sales based on expected excess generating capability, forward prices and generation costs, using a diversified market approach to provide a balance between long term, mid term and spot energy sales. TEP generally enters into forward purchases during its summer peaking period to ensure it can meet its load and reserve requirements and account for other contracts and resource contingencies. TEP also enters into limited forward purchases and sales to optimize its resource portfolio and take advantage of locational differences in price. These positions are managed on both a volumetric and dollar basis and are closely monitored using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk K 72 Table of Contents Management Committee. For example, the risk management policies provide that TEP should not take a short position in the third quarter and must have owned generation backing up all forward sales positions at the time the sale is made. TEPs risk management policies also restrict entering into forward positions with maturities extending beyond the end of the next calendar year except for approved hedging purposes. The majority of TEPs forward contracts are considered to be normal purchases and sales of electric energy and are not considered to be derivatives under FAS 133. TEP records revenues on its normal sales and expenses on its normal purchases in the period in which the energy is delivered. From time to time, however, TEP enters into forward contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. When TEP has derivative forward contracts, it marks them to market using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers for power traded over the counter at Palo Verde and at other southwestern U.S. trading hubs. TEP believes that these broker quotations used to calculate the mark to market values represent accurate measures of the fair values of TEPs positions because of the short term nature of TEPs positions, as limited by risk management policies, and the liquidity in the short term market. To adjust the value of its derivative forward power sales and purchases, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $6 $(1) $ TEP also reported the following net unrealized gains and losses on forward power sales and purchases in Wholesale Sales and Purchased Power. 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Net Unrealized Gain (Loss) $1 $(1) $2 TEP uses sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an unfavorable change in market prices on the fair value of its derivative forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs forward power sales contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains of $3 million. For TEPs forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net losses of $3 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net losses of $3 million. For TEPs forward power contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $1 million increase in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $1 million decrease in unrealized gains reported in Other Comprehensive Income. The unrealized gains and losses are reversed as contracts settle and realized gains or losses are recorded. Natural Gas TEP is also subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of natural gas. In addition to energy from its coal fired facilities, TEP typically uses purchased power, supplemented by generation from its gas fired units, to meet the summer peak demands of its retail customers and to meet local reliability needs. Some of these purchased power contracts are price indexed to natural gas prices. Short term and spot power purchase prices are also closely correlated to natural gas prices. Due to its increasing seasonal gas and purchased power usage, TEP hedges a portion of its total natural gas exposure from plant fuel, gas indexed purchase power and spot market purchases with fixed price contracts for a maximum of three years. TEP purchases its remaining gas fuel needs and purchased power in the spot and short term markets. In 2006, the average market price of natural gas was $6.05 per MMBtu, or 16% lower than 2005. The table below summarizes TEPs gas generation output and purchased power for 2006, 2005 and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Millions of MWhs % of Total Resources Gas Fired Generation 848 368 432 6% 3% 3% Purchased Power 1,644 1,639 1,322 12% 13% 10% K 73 Table of Contents To adjust the value of its derivative gas swap contracts, classified as cash flow hedges, to fair value in Other Comprehensive Income, TEP recorded the following net unrealized gains and losses: 2006 2005 2004 Millions of Dollars Unrealized Gain (Loss) $(17) $11 $3 As of December 31, 2006, for TEPs gas swap agreements, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a $3 million increase in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in a $3 million decrease in unrealized losses reported in Other Comprehensive Income. Coal TEP is subject to commodity price risk from changes in the price of coal used to fuel its coal fired generating plants. In 2003, TEP amended and extended the long term coal supply contract for Springerville Units 1 and 2 through 2020 and expects coal reserves to be sufficient to supply the estimated requirements for Units 1 and 2 for their presently estimated remaining lives. During the extension period from 2011 through 2020, the coal price will be determined by the cost of Powder River Basin coal delivered to Springerville Unit 3 subject to a floor and ceiling. Based on current coal market conditions, this range would be from $24 to $30 per ton. TEP estimates its future minimum annual payments under this contract to be $45 million through 2010, the initial contract expiration date, and $14 million from 2011 through 2020. TEPs coal transportation contract at Springerville runs through June of 2011. TEP estimates minimum annual payments under this contract to be $13 million through 2010 and $7 million in 2011. In December 2006, TEP entered into agreements for the purchase and transportation of coal to Sundt Unit 4 through December 2008. Although TEP expects to pay $20 million annually, the total amount paid under these agreements depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported. In 2007, the impact on TEPs total coal related fuel expense across all of its plants is expected to increase by $17 million, or 9%. The long term rail contract for Sundt Unit 4 is in effect until the earliest of 2015, the remaining life of Sundt Unit 4 or the life of the coal mine. This rail contract requires TEP to transport at least 75,000 tons of coal per year through 2015 at an estimated annual cost of $2 million or to make a minimum payment of $1 million. TEP also participates in jointly owned generating facilities at Four Corners, Navajo and San Juan, where coal supplies are under long term contracts administered by the operating agents. In 2003, the Four Corners coal contract was extended through July 2016. This contract requires TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated annual cost of $6 million. TEP expects coal reserves available to these three jointly owned generating facilities to be sufficient for the remaining lives of the stations. The contracts to purchase coal for use at the jointly owned facilities require TEP to purchase minimum amounts of coal at an estimated average annual cost of $21 million for the next five years. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, UniSource Energy Consolidated, Contractual Obligations and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies, TEP Commitments, Purchase and Transportation Commitments. UNS Gas UNS Gas is subject to commodity price risk, primarily from the changes in the price of natural gas purchased for its customers. This risk is mitigated through the PGA mechanism which provides an adjustment to UNS Gas retail rates to recover the actual costs of gas and transportation. UNS Gas further reduces this risk by purchasing forward fixed price contracts for a portion of its projected gas needs under its Price Stabilization Plan. UNS Gas purchases at least 45% of its estimated gas needs in this manner. UNS Electric UNS Electric is currently not exposed to commodity price risk for its purchase of electricity as it has a fixed price full requirements supply agreement with PWMT and a PPFAC mechanism which fully recovers the costs incurred K 74 Table of Contents under such contract on a timely basis. This supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008 and UNS Electric is in the process of replacing this energy resource. During 2006, UNS Electric entered into various power supply agreements for periods of one to five years beginning in June 2008. Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and others are indexed to natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Electric estimates its future minimum annual payments under these contracts to be $23 million. Because a portion of the costs under these contracts will vary from period to period based on the market price of gas, the PPFAC, as currently structured, may not provide recovery of the costs incurred under these new contracts on a timely basis. For UNS Electrics forward power purchase contracts, a 10% decrease in market prices would result in a decrease in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million, while a 10% increase in market prices would result in an increase in unrealized net gains reported as a regulatory liability of $10 million. MEG MEG trades Emission Allowances and related instruments; however, its current activities consist of managing a small number of remaining positions which are expected to close by early 2008. We manage the market risk of this line of business by setting notional limits by product, as well as limits to the potential change in fair market value under a 33% change in price or volatility. We closely monitor MEGs trading activities, which include swap agreements, options and forward contracts, using risk management policies and procedures overseen by the Risk Management Committee. MEG marks its trading positions to market on a daily basis using actively quoted prices obtained from brokers and options pricing models for positions that extend through 2007. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the fair value of MEGs trading assets combined with Emission Allowances it holds in escrow was $11 million and $38 million, respectively. The fair value of MEGs trading liabilities was $5 million at December 31, 2006 and $24 million at December 31, 2005. For 2006, MEG reflected a $10 million unrealized loss and a $10 million realized gain on its income statement, compared with an unrealized gain of $11 million and a realized loss of $11 million in the same period last year. For MEGs remaining trading contracts at December 31, 2006, a 10% decrease in market prices or a 10% increase in market prices would be less than $1 million. Unrealized Gain (Loss) of MEGs Trading Activities Millions of Dollars Source of Fair Value At December 31, 2006 Maturity 0 6 months Maturity 6 12 months Maturity over 1 yr. Total Unrealized Gain (Loss) Prices actively quoted $ 4 $ 2 $ $ 6 Prices based on models and other valuation methods 3 3 Total $ 4 $ 5 $ $ 9 Credit Risk UniSource Energy is exposed to credit risk in its energy related marketing and trading activities related to potential nonperformance by counterparties. We manage the risk of counterparty default by performing financial credit reviews, setting limits, monitoring exposures, requiring collateral when needed, and using a standard agreement which allows for the netting of current period exposures to and from a single counterparty. We calculate counterparty credit exposure by adding any outstanding receivable (net of amounts payable if a netting agreement exists) to the mark to market value of any forward contracts. As of December 31, 2006, TEPs total credit exposure related to its wholesale marketing and gas hedging activities was approximately $34 million. Approximately $2 million of TEPs exposure is to non investment grade companies. TEP had five counterparties with exposures of greater than 10% of its total credit exposure, totaling approximately $23 million. MEGs total credit exposure related to its trading activities was $5 million and was concentrated primarily with two counterparties. MEG has no credit exposure to non investment grade counterparties. UNS Gas is subject to credit risk from non performance by its supply counterparty, BP Energy (BP), to the extent that this contract has a mark to market value in favor of UNS Gas. As of December 31, 2006, UNS Gas K 75 Table of Contents has purchased under fixed price contracts approximately 48% of the expected monthly consumption for the 2006/2007 winter season (November through March) and approximately 29% of its expected consumption for the 2007/2008 winter season. At December 31, 2006, UNS Gas had no credit exposure under its supply contract with BP. UNS Electric has begun to enter into energy purchase agreements to replace the full requirements contract it has with PWMT that expires in May 2008. To the extent that such contracts have a positive mark to market value, UNS Electric would be exposed to credit risk under those contracts. At December 31, 2006, UNS Electric had less than $1 million in credit exposure under such contracts.
