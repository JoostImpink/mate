Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of the Partnerships historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K (the Report) contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities law. These forward looking statements reflect the current view of the Partnership and CCC, with respect to future events and financial performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Partnership and CCC. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Report, including statements under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, regarding the Partnerships strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of the Partnership are forward looking statements. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. The Partnership does not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although the Partnership and CCC believe that their plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward looking statements made in this report are reasonable, the Partnership and CCC can give no assurance that these plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. Future economic, political and industry trends that could potentially impact revenues and profitability are difficult to predict, as well as the risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, changes in demand for leased containers, changes in global business conditions and their effect on world trade, changes within the global shipping industry, the financial strength of the shipping lines and other sub lessees of the Partnerships containers, fluctuations in new container prices, changes in the costs of maintaining and repairing used containers, changes in competition, changes in the ability of the Leasing Company to maintain insurance on behalf of the Partnerships container fleet, as well as other risks detailed herein and from time to time in the Partnerships filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 16 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources During the Partnerships first 10 years of operations, the Partnerships primary objective was to generate cash flow from operations for distribution to its limited partners. Aside from the initial working capital reserve retained from gross subscription proceeds (equal to approximately 1% of such proceeds), the Partnership relies primarily on net lease revenue receipts to meet this objective, as well as to finance operating needs. No credit lines are maintained to finance working capital. Commencing in April 2006, the Partnership entered its liquidation phase, wherein CCC began to focus its attention on the retirement of the remaining equipment in the Partnerships container fleet, in accordance with another of its original investment objectives, realizing the residual value of its containers after the expiration of their economic useful lives, estimated to be between 12 to 15 years after placement in leased service. The Partnership has entered its 12th year of operations. Accordingly, it will continue its liquidation phase. CCC will take several factors into consideration when examining options for the timing of the disposal of the containers. These factors include the impact of a diminishing fleet size and current market conditions on the level of gross lease revenue, and fixed operating costs relative to this revenue. Parallel to these considerations will be a projected increase in expenses for devoting significant resources to the additional reporting and compliance requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which addresses a range of corporate governance, disclosure, and accounting issues. These costs may include increased accounting and administrative expenses for additional staffing and outside professional services by accountants and consultants. These additional costs, depending on their materiality, may reduce the Partnerships results from operations and therefore negatively affect future distributions to the Limited Partners. Upon the liquidation of CCCs interest in the Partnership, CCC shall contribute to the Partnership, if necessary, an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balance in its capital account at the time of such liquidation, or 1.01% of the excess of the Limited Partners capital contribution to the Partnership over the capital contributions previously made to the Partnership by CCC, after giving effect to the allocation of income or loss arising from the liquidation of the Partnerships assets. Distributions are paid monthly, based primarily on each quarters cash flow from operations. Monthly distributions are also affected by periodic increases or decreases to working capital reserves, as deemed appropriate by CCC. Cash distributions from operations are allocated 5% to CCC and 95% to the limited partners. Distributions of sales proceeds are allocated 1% to CCC and 99% to the limited partners. This sharing arrangement will remain in place until the limited partners have received aggregate distributions in an amount equal to their capital contributions plus an 8% cumulative, compounded (daily) annual return on their adjusted capital contributions. Thereafter, all distributions will be allocated 15% to CCC and 85% to the limited partners, pursuant to Section 6.1(b) of the Partnerships Partnership Agreement. From inception through February 28, 2007, the Partnership has distributed, on a cash basis, $22,773,824 in cash from operations and $2,099,269 in cash from container sales proceeds to its limited partners. This represents total cash basis distributions of $24,873,093, or 78% of the limited partners original invested capital. The liquidation of the Partnerships remaining containers will be the primary factor influencing the future level of cash generated from operating, investing and financing activities and the level of distributions from operations and sales proceeds to its partners in subsequent periods. At December 31, 2006, the Partnership had $1,203,374 in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $155,112 and $755,309 from cash balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Partnership invests its working capital, as well as cash flows from operations and the sale of containers that have not yet been distributed to CCC or its limited partners in money market funds. At December 31, 2006, the Partnership had an additional $30,000 as part of its working capital for estimated expenses related to the ultimate sale of its remaining containers, final liquidation of its remaining assets and subsequent dissolution. Cash from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, primarily generated from the billing and collection of net lease revenue was $2,211,151 during 2006, compared to $2,746,805 and $2,872,746 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash from Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds generated from the sale of rental equipment and amounted to $1,399,068 in 2006 compared to $711,276 and $893,764 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2004 amount represents sales proceeds generated from the sale of container equipment, as well as the release of restricted deposits associated with the Partnerships repayment of term debt. Cash from Financing Activities: During 2006, net cash used in financing activities was $3,455,107, compared to $2,857,884 and $4,594,695 during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net cash used by financing activities during 2006 and 2005 was comprised solely of distributions to the Partnerships general and limited partners. In comparison, during 2004, net cash used in financing activities was comprised of 17 Table of Contents $2,493,195 in distributions to the Partnerships general and limited partners and $2,101,500, representing the scheduled repayment of term debt. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Partnership does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2006, the Partnership was not involved in any material unconsolidated SPE transactions. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2006, the Partnership did not have any contractual obligations or commercial commitments Results of Operations Market Overview Pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, all authority to administer the business of the Partnership is vested with CCC. A Leasing Agent Agreement (Agreement) exists between the Partnership and the Leasing Company, whereby the Leasing Company has the responsibility to manage the leasing operations of all equipment owned by the Partnership. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Leasing Company is responsible for leasing, managing and re leasing the Partnerships containers to ocean carriers, and has full discretion over which ocean carriers and suppliers of goods and services it may deal with. The Leasing Agent Agreement permits the Leasing Company to use the containers owned by the Partnership, together with other containers owned or managed by the Leasing Company and its affiliates, as part of a single fleet operated without regard to ownership. The primary component of the Partnerships results of operations is net lease revenue. Net lease revenue is determined by deducting direct operating expenses, management fees and reimbursed administrative expenses from gross lease revenues billed by the Leasing Company from the leasing of the Partnerships containers. Net lease revenue is directly related to the size, utilization and per diem rental rates of the Partnerships fleet. Direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with the Partnerships containers. Direct operating expenses may be categorized as follows: Activity related expenses, including agents costs and depot costs such as repairs, maintenance and handling. Inventory related expenses for off hire containers, comprising of storage and repositioning costs. These costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered. Legal and other expenses, including legal costs related to the recovery of containers and doubtful accounts, insurance and provisions for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2006, approximately 82% of the original equipment remained in the Partnerships fleet, compared to 89% at December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes the composition of the Partnerships fleet (based on container type) at December 31, 2006.

Industry observers report that global container trade grew by an estimated rate of 10% in each of the years 2006 and 2005, 15% in 2004 and 8% in 2003. In comparison, global container trade grew by a modest 3.7% during 2001, a recession year. The strength of the container leasing market reflected the shipping lines strategy to lease containers and reduce their rate of off hiring containers from existing leases. Despite container lessor and shipping lines making new container investment during 2006 that is estimated to result in the record production of more than 3 million twenty foot equivalent units (TEU), there were significant reductions in the available surplus of containers in key demand areas, and little or no surplus of new containers at the factory. Faced with possible shortages of containers, shipping lines employed various strategies resulting in the best possible use of their owned and leased containers, including repositioning leased containers back into locations where their requirement is strongest, as opposed to off hiring containers upon reaching a particular port destination. Traffic volumes on many of the worlds key trade lanes continued to exceed industry analysts original forecasts. Utilization of the Partnerships dry cargo container fleet averaged 89% during 2006. In comparison, the dry cargo container fleet averaged 93% during 2005 and 2004. The utilization rate for the Partnerships refrigerated container fleet averaged 85% during 2006, while measuring an average 88% and 90% during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The utilization rates for the Partnerships tank container fleet measured 91%, 92% and 90%, during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These utilization levels generally contributed to lower levels of off hire container inventories and related direct operating costs, including storage, repositioning and other inventory related operating expenses. Although the 2006 demand for existing dry cargo containers eased from the levels experienced in the prior two years, when demand often exceeded supply, it did result in a more balanced leasing market. The average per diem rate for the Partnerships dry cargo containers decreased approximately 8% and 7% when compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average per diem rate for the Partnerships refrigerated cargo containers decreased approximately 6% and 17% when compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average per diem rate for the Partnerships tank cargo containers decreased approximately 1% and 3% when compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. The lease market for the Partnerships older containers remains competitive and, therefore, will be subject to significant pricing pressures in subsequent periods. Unlike dry cargo containers, the refrigerated and tank containers are built for specific market demands. As such, the markets for the leasing of refrigerated and tank containers are narrower than the market for dry cargo containers and are subject to different trends and fluctuations than the dry cargo container market. 19 Table of Contents In future periods, economic growth and global container trade are expected to have less of an impact on the Partnerships operations when compared to the effects of CCCs efforts to retire the remaining equipment in the Partnerships container fleet. One of the Partnerships original investment objectives was to realize the residual value of its containers after the expiration of their useful lives, estimated to be between 12 to 15 years after placement in leased service. During 2006, the secondary market demand for used containers remained favorable. Higher utilization levels not only contributed to a reduction in container inventories, but also a corresponding decrease in the volume of containers available for sale and an increase in container sale prices. Changes in future inventory levels, as well as significant fluctuations in new container prices, could adversely affect sales proceeds realized on the sale of the Partnerships remaining containers. The sale of the Partnerships off hire containers, in accordance with one of its aforementioned original investment objectives, has positively affected the Partnerships results from operations, minimizing storage and other inventory related costs incurred for its off hire containers. During 2006, the price of a new twenty foot dry cargo container fluctuated between $1,800 and $2,000, ending the year at $2,000, an increase from approximately $1,500 at the beginning of the year. The volatility of new container prices was a result of fluctuating demand and the price of raw materials used in the production of containers, as well as the strong demand created by the addition of new containerships. By the end of the year, many container manufacturing plants were reported to be operating at 60% of capacity, a result of additional capacity created by the addition of new container factory start ups. The additional capacity created by these new factories may result in additional container pricing volatility, as container manufacturers offer additional pricing incentives. Although the Partnership no longer purchases new containers, new container production and the price of new containers indirectly contributed to the Partnerships results of operations by influencing the available surplus of containers and utilization, the level of lease per diems for existing older containers, as well as container sale prices realized upon their eventual disposal. The Partnerships primary lessees, the shipping lines, have experienced significant decline in profits during 2006, as their financial performance has been impacted by the additional cargo capacity created by the delivery of new containerships, and a corresponding decline in freight rates. A significant number of new containerships built under various shipbuilding programs have been delivered during 2006, resulting in an additional slot capacity of 1.85 million TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit), an increase of approximately 55% from the prior year. Containership capacity is estimated to further increase by approximately 15% and 14% in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, higher fuel costs and interest rates have also contributed to lower profits for the shipping lines. Certain economic trends that continued throughout 2006, including higher energy costs, coupled with rising interest rates and higher consumer prices in the US and other countries, support a slowing in the growth of the global economy. Industry analysts forecast global container trade to rise by no more than 9% in each of the next two years, a substantial growth rate overall, but at a more moderate rate than in prior recent years, and below the anticipated growth in containership capacity. The Partnership, CCC and the Leasing Company continue to monitor the aging of lease receivables, collections and the credit exposure to various existing and new customers. The financial impact of losses from shipping lines may eventually influence the demand for leased containers, as some shipping lines may experience financial difficulties, consolidate, or become insolvent. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net lease revenue was $2,316,295 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $2,803,236 for the prior year. The decline was primarily due to a $542,739 decline in gross rental revenue (a component of net lease revenue). Gross lease revenue was impacted by the Partnerships smaller fleet size, and an 8% decline in the average dry cargo per diem rental rate. Also contributing to the decline in net lease revenue was an increase in rental equipment operating expenses (a component of net lease revenue) of $10,806, primarily attributable to activity related expenses such as handling and storage. Depreciation expense amounted to $1,689,468 in 2006, a decrease of $153,126 when compared to 2005, a direct result of the Partnerships declining fleet size. Other general and administrative expenses amounted to $110,848 in 2006, an increase of $31,133 or 39% when compared to 2005. The increase was attributable to higher professional fees for audit service and third party investor administration services. Impairment charge of $37,972 was incurred by the Partnership during 2005 relating to 111 off hire forty foot standard dry cargo containers located in North America (the North American Dry Containers). The impairment charge was a result of a number of factors identified by 20 Table of Contents CCC and the Leasing Company that impacted the carrying value of the North American Dry Containers: The age of the North American Dry Containers; The lack of demand for the North American Dry Containers; The cost to reposition the North American Dry Containers to high demand markets; and The strong North American container sale market. CCC and the Leasing Company considered the impact of these factors, and determined a change regarding the current marketing strategy for the containers was required. CCC and the Leasing Company concluded that effective June 1, 2005, the 111 North American Dry Containers would be targeted for immediate sale. It was concluded that the carrying value of these containers, $193,372, exceeded fair value and accordingly, an impairment charge of $37,972, or approximately $0.02 per limited partnership unit, was recorded to operations under impairment losses during 2005. Fair value was determined by estimating the expected amount to be received at the time of sale. The expected sales price was estimated by evaluating the current sales price of similar containers. During 2006, the Partnership sold four of the 111 North American Dry Containers originally targeted for sale. The Partnership recognized a gain of $370 on the sale of these containers. At December 31, 2006, 47 of the original 111 North American Dry Containers remained in its fleet. These North American Dry Containers were originally classified as held for sale after their impairment in 2005 as a result of the aforementioned conditions that existed at the time of impairment. The Partnership reclassified these containers as held and used as of December 31, 2006. The reclassification is the result of current market conditions that have contributed to 41 of the remaining 47 North American Dry Containers being leased under master leases and 6 North American Dry Containers being off hire and available for lease. The Partnership expects to sell these North American Dry Containers, subject to the same disposal criteria employed for its remaining container fleet. There was no reduction to the carrying value of container rental equipment due to impairment during 2006. Net loss on disposal of equipment for 2006 was $363,720 compared to a net gain of $55,821 during 2005. During 2006, the Partnership disposed of 585 containers, as compared to 554 containers during 2005. Included within the 585 containers disposed during 2006 were 109 refrigerated containers. Of this total, 93 of the refrigerated containers disposed were attributable to one lessee, who returned the containers in poor condition after the expiration of a long term lease. CCC and CCL deemed that these containers were beyond economical repair and they were subsequently disposed at a loss of $343,358. Also contributing to the net loss on container disposals, were the proceeds realized from the container disposal, age, condition, suitability for continued leasing, as well as the geographical location of the containers when disposed. These factors will continue to influence the amount of sales proceeds received and the related gain or loss on container disposals. The level of the Partnerships container disposals in subsequent periods, as well as the price of steel, new container prices and the current leasing markets impact on sales prices for existing older containers such as those owned by the Partnership, will also contribute to fluctuations in the net gain or loss on disposals. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net lease revenue was $2,803,236 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $3,001,124 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a $195,292 decrease in gross rental revenue and a $30,333 increase in rental equipment operating expenses. Gross rental revenue was impacted by the Partnerships smaller fleet size and a 11% decrease in the average refrigerated per diem rental rates during 2005. The increase in direct operating expense was attributable to the Partnerships activity based expenses, such as repair and maintenance, which increased compared to the prior year. Lower refrigerated utilization rates contributed to higher inventory based expenses such as storage. However, the increase in storage expense was offset by a reduction in repositioning expense. The Partnership also recognized an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. Other components of net lease revenue, including management fees and reimbursed administrative expenses, were lower by a combined $27,737 when compared to 2004. Depreciation expense amounted to $1,842,594 in 2005, a decrease of $111,934 when compared to 2004, a direct result of the Partnerships declining fleet size. 21 Table of Contents Other general and administrative expenses amounted to $79,715 in 2005, an increase of $9,056 or 13% when compared to 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in third party investor administration services and professional fees. Net gain on disposal of equipment was a result of the Partnerships disposal of 554 containers in 2005, as compared to 129 containers during 2004. These disposals resulted in a net gain of $55,821 during 2005, compared to $20,179 during 2004. Included within the 554 containers disposed during 2005 were 60 North American Dry Containers impaired and targeted for sale as of June 1, 2005. A gain of $9,079 was attributable to the sale of these 60 containers. The Partnership believes that the net gain on container disposals in 2004 was a result of various factors, including the volume of disposed containers, age, condition, suitability for continued leasing, as well as the geographical location of the containers when disposed. Interest expense was not incurred during 2005. In comparison, $54,317 of interest expense was incurred in 2004. This decrease was attributable to the August 2004 prepayment of the term loan debt by the Partnership. Critical Accounting Policies Container equipment depreciable lives: The Partnerships cargo container rental equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over a useful life of 15 years to a residual value of 10%. The Partnership and CCC evaluate the period of amortization and residual values to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives and residual values. Container equipment valuation: The Partnership and CCC review container rental equipment when changes in circumstances require consideration as to whether the carrying value of the equipment has become impaired, pursuant to guidance established in SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. The Partnership and CCC consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations (undiscounted and without interest charges). When impairment is deemed to exist, the assets are written down to fair value or future projected cash flows from related operations. The Partnership and CCC evaluate future cash flows and potential impairment of its fleet by container type rather than for each individual container. Therefore, future losses could result for individual container dispositions due to various factors including age, condition, suitability for continued leasing, as well as geographic location of the containers where disposed. Considerable judgment is required in estimating future cash flows from container rental equipment operations. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the amounts that may be realized in future periods. As additional information becomes available in subsequent periods, recognition of an impairment of the container rental equipment carrying values may be necessary based upon changes in market and economic conditions. Allowance for doubtful accounts: The Leasing Company continually tracks the Partnerships credit exposure to each of the sub lessees of the Partnerships containers using specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by its local staff to assess credit quality. The Leasing Companys credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions taken in order to minimize credit risk. The Leasing Company derives an allowance for doubtful accounts reflecting specific amounts provided against known probable losses plus an additional amount based on historical loss experience. However, the Partnership may be subject to an unexpected loss in net lease revenue resulting from sub lessees of its containers that default under their container lease agreements with the Leasing Company. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change, the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Partnership adopted SFAS 154 effective January 1, 2006, with no significant impact on the financial position or result of operations of the Partnership. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 17, 2007 and interim periods beginning after that date. Earlier adoption is encouraged, providing no financial statements have yet been issued during the fiscal year. SFAS 157 defines fair value, the methods used to measure fair 22 Table of Contents value and will require expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The Partnership will adopt SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 but does not expect adoption to have a significant impact on the financial position or result of operations of the Partnership, however, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measures and the effect of certain measures on changes in assets and liabilities for the period. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. AUG AIR 1 (FSP AIR 1) Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities which addresses the accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP AIR 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, although earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year. The guidance in FSP AIR 1 shall be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented, unless it is impracticable to do so. FSP AIR 1 amends certain provisions in the AICPA Industry Audit Guide, Audits of Airlines and the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting. FSP AIR 1 prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods. The Partnership early adopted FSP AIR 1, effective January 1, 2006, with no significant impact on the financial position or result of operations of the Partnership. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Section N to Topic 1, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires the evaluation of prior year misstatements using both the balance sheet approach and the income statement approach. In the initial year of adoption, should either approach result in quantifying an error that is material in the light of quantitative and qualitative factors, SAB 108 guidance allows for a one time cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. In years subsequent to adoption, previously undetected misstatements deemed material shall result in the restatement of previously issued financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SAB 108 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Partnership adopted SAB 108 in 2006 with no significant impact on the financial position or result of its operations of the Partnership. Inflation The Partnership believes inflation has not had a material adverse affect on the results of its operations. The Cronos Group The Parent Company announced on February 28, 2007 the proposed sale of the Parent Company to CRX Acquisition Ltd. (Purchaser), an affiliate of the Fortis group of companies, which include the Parent Companys lead lender and a partner in the Parent Companys Joint Venture Program. The Parent Company reported the proposed sale in its 8 K report of March 2, 2007. Consummation of the transaction requires the approval of the Parent Companys shareholders, which will be sought at the Parent Companys 2007 annual meeting. The proxy statement for that meeting will contain detailed disclosures regarding the transaction. As proposed, the transaction consists of the sale of all of the Parent Companys assets to CRX and the assumption by CRX of all of its liabilities. In connection with the proposed sale, the Parent Company will submit to its shareholders a plan of liquidation, providing for the liquidation of the Parent Company promptly after sale of its assets to CRX and CRXs assumption of the Parent Companys liabilities. If approved by the Parent Companys shareholders, and the transaction closes, the Parent Company will liquidate and dissolve, and its business will be continued by CRX as a private company. The management of the Parent Company will continue as the management of CRX, and members of the senior management of the Parent Company will acquire an equity interest in the Purchaser. The Parent Company anticipates a closing of the transaction this summer. CCC does not anticipate any changes in its management, or in the Leasing Companys ability to manage the Partnerships fleet in subsequent periods, but is unable to determine the impact, if any, the Parent Companys sale may have on the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Partnership or CCC. 23 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Exchange rate risk: In 2006, approximately 93% of the gross lease revenues billed by the Leasing Company on behalf of the Group, or on behalf of other third party container owners, including the Partnership, were billed and paid in US dollars, and approximately 48% of expenses were incurred and paid in US dollars. For non US dollar denominated revenues and expenses, the Leasing Company may enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk. Of the non US dollar direct operating expenses, the Leasing Company estimates approximately 70% are individually small, unpredictable and were incurred in varying denominations. Thus, the Leasing Company determined such amounts are not suitable for cost effective hedging. As exchange rates are outside of the control of the Partnership and Leasing Company, there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect the Partnerships results of operations and financial condition.
