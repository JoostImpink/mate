The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority. We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward looking statements. Executive Level Overview We believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. We serve more than 500,000 customers worldwide, including dental practitioners and laboratories, physician practices and animal health clinics, as well as government and other institutions. We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our 75 years of experience distributing healthcare products. We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 11,000 people and have operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. We also have an affiliate in Iceland. We have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers needs. Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment. We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The healthcare distribution 29 Table of Contents reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical (including animal health) and international operating segments. Products distributed include consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins. Our dental group serves office based dental practitioners, schools and other institutions in the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office based medical practitioners, surgical centers, other alternate care settings, animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the United States. Our international group serves 17 countries outside of North America and is what we believe to be a leading European healthcare supplier serving office based practitioners. Our technology group provides software, technology and other value added services to healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States and Canada. Our value added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics. Our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners. Industry Overview In recent years, the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices. It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management. Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry, including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies, potential healthcare reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements. Industry Consolidation The healthcare products distribution industry, as it relates to office based healthcare practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental, medical and animal health markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $22.0 billion in 2006 in the combined North American and European markets. The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices. Due in part to the inability of office based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office based healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier. We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. 30 Table of Contents Our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. This trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses. As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure. In the U.S. dental market, we estimate that there are currently more than 300 smaller distributors holding over 25% of the market. In the U.S. medical market, we estimate that more than 500 smaller distributors hold over 50% of the market, and in the European dental market, we estimate that more than 200 smaller distributors hold over 80% of the market. As the healthcare industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and acquisition related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful. Aging Population and Other Market Influences The healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased healthcare awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage. In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from hospitals to alternate care sites, particularly physicians offices. As the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow, physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices. The elder care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly Americans. The January 2000 U.S. Bureau of the Census estimated that the elderly population in the United States will more than double by the year 2040. In 2000, four million Americans were aged 85 or older, the segment of the population most in need of long term care and elder care services. By the year 2040, that number is projected to more than triple to more than 14 million. The population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to more than double in the same time period. As a result of these market dynamics, the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the United States. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published National Health Care Expenditures Projections: 2005 2015 indicating that total national healthcare spending reached $1.9 trillion in 2004, or 16.0% of the nations gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United States. Healthcare spending is projected to reach $4.0 trillion in 2015, an estimated 20.0% of the nations gross domestic product. Government Influences The healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation, licensure and operating compliance procedures. National healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by Congress. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care. The Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in 1997 significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers, affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (the Medicare Act) is the largest expansion of the Medicare program since its inception, and provides participants with voluntary 31 Table of Contents prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card. The Medicare Act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs, generic substitution and provider reimbursement. There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government, including state departments of health, state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. Certain states have already adopted laws and regulations, including pedigree tracking requirements, that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system. Regulations adopted under the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act, effective December, 2006, require the passage of pedigree information. Other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations. We continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation. Results of Operations The following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 (in thousands): Years ended December 30, December 31, December 25, 2006 2005 (1) 2004 (1) Operating Results: Net sales $ 5,153,097 $ 4,635,929 $ 3,898,485 Cost of sales 3,673,042 3,318,993 2,844,020 Gross profit 1,480,055 1,316,936 1,054,465 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (2) 1,175,158 1,053,798 862,267 Operating income $ 304,897 $ 263,138 $ 192,198 Other expense, net $ (9,295 ) $ (16,534 ) $ (11,121 ) Income from continuing operations 183,127 151,012 114,274 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (19,368 ) (11,253 ) 2,565 Net income 163,759 139,759 116,839 Years ended December 30, December 31, December 25, 2006 2005 (1)(3) 2004 (1) Cash Flows: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 235,317 $ 254,776 $ 182,621 Net cash used in investing activities (180,361 ) (206,681 ) (171,829 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (21,274 ) (28,501 ) 34,748 (1) Adjusted to reflect the effects of our adoption of FAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective application. (2) During 2004, we recorded a $13.2 million pre tax ($8.4 million post tax) charge related to our Fluvirin contract with Chiron Corporation. This charge, which represented the write off of a deferred expense associated with the 2005/2006 influenza season, occurred as a result of the significant uncertainty about whether Chiron would be able to provide Fluvirin for the 2005/2006 influenza season. The effect that this charge had on earnings per share for the year ended December 25, 2004 was $(0.10). (3) Adjusted to reflect the reclassification of variable rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to available for sale securities at December 31, 2005. 32 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Net Sales Net sales for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in thousands): % of % of 2006 Total 2005 Total Healthcare distribution (1): Dental (2) $ 2,136,830 41.5 % $ 1,896,643 40.9 % Medical (3) 1,516,155 29.4 1,394,121 30.1 International (4) 1,401,889 27.2 1,256,910 27.1 Total healthcare distribution 5,054,874 98.1 4,547,674 98.1 Technology (5) 98,223 1.9 88,255 1.9 Total $ 5,153,097 100.0 % $ 4,635,929 100.0 % (1) Consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

(4) Consists of products sold in the dental, medical and animal health markets, primarily in Europe. (5) Consists of practice management software and other value added products and services, which are sold primarily to healthcare providers in the United States and Canada. The $517.2 million, or 11.2%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 30, 2006 includes increases of 10.6% local currency growth (5.2% internally generated primarily due to volume growth and 5.4% from acquisitions) and 0.6% related to foreign currency exchange. The $240.2 million, or 12.7%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 30, 2006 includes increases of 11.9% local currency growth (8.4% internally generated primarily due to increased volume and 3.5% from acquisitions) and 0.8% related to foreign currency exchange. The 11.9% local currency growth was due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 9.8% (6.1% internal growth and 3.7% from acquisitions) and dental equipment sales and service growth of 18.4% (15.6% internal growth and 2.8% from acquisitions). The $122.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 30, 2006 includes increases of 8.8% local currency growth (0.6% internally generated and 8.2% from acquisitions). The $145.0 million, or 11.5%, increase in international net sales for the year ended December 30, 2006 includes increases of 10.7% in local currencies (5.6% from acquisitions and 5.1% internally generated), and 0.8% related to foreign currency exchange. The $10.0 million, or 11.3%, increase in technology net sales for the year ended December 30, 2006 includes increases of 10.9% in local currency growth (8.6% internally generated and 2.3% from acquisitions) and 0.4% due to foreign currency exchange. The increase was driven by growth in electronic service, financial services and support/maintenance revenue. 33 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit and gross margins for 2006 and 2005 by segment and in total were as follows (in thousands): Gross Gross 2006 Margin % 2005 Margin % Healthcare distribution $ 1,404,552 27.8 % $ 1,249,836 27.5 % Technology 75,503 76.9 67,100 76.0 Total $ 1,480,055 28.7 $ 1,316,936 28.4 Gross profit increased $163.1 million, or 12.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies. Additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment. These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry, in which developers typically realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development. Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $154.7 million, or 12.4%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased slightly to 27.8% for the year ended December 30, 2006 from 27.5% for the comparable prior year period. Technology gross profit increased $8.4 million, or 12.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. Technology gross profit margin increased to 76.9% for the year ended December 30, 2006 from 76.0% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a change in sales mix reflecting a larger percentage of higher margin electronic and financial services sales and other cost improvements, largely in technical support. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses by segment and in total for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in thousands): % of % of Respective Respective 2006 Net Sales 2005 (1) Net Sales Healthcare distribution $ 1,136,858 22.5 % $ 1,019,317 22.4 % Technology 38,300 39.0 34,481 39.1 Total $ 1,175,158 22.8 $ 1,053,798 22.7 (1) Adjusted to reflect the effects of our adoption of FAS 123(R) using the modified retrospective application. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121.4 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 22.8% from 22.7% for the comparable prior year period. This increase of 0.1% was primarily due to payroll and other expenses related to recent acquisitions. As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses increased $88.3 million, or 12.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to payroll and other expenses related to recent acquisitions. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 15.4% from 15.2% for the comparable prior year period. 34 Table of Contents As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and administrative expenses increased $33.1 million, or 9.5%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 from the prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.4% from 7.5% for the comparable prior year period. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net for the years ended 2006 and 2005 was as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 Interest income $ 16,440 $ 7,315 Interest expense (27,800 ) (25,508 ) Other, net 2,065 1,659 Other expense, net $ (9,295 ) $ (16,534 ) Other expense, net decreased $7.2 million to $9.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 from the comparable prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and average investment balances, a gain of approximately $2.0 million associated with a change in accounting for net investment hedging arrangements (see Note 1 to accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a reduction of interest expense of approximately $2.8 million representing the interest rate component of our mark to market adjustment, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher interest rates. Income Taxes For the year ended December 30, 2006, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 35.6% compared to 36.7% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations In the first quarter of 2006 and during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss of $19.4 million and $11.3 million, net of tax, related to discontinued operations (see Note 6 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Net Income Net income increased $24.0 million, or 17.2%, for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the prior year period. In 2006, net income includes a loss on the sale of discontinued operations of $19.4 million, net of taxes. In 2005, net income includes an impairment charge related to long lived assets of discontinued operations of $7.0 million, net of tax. 35 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Net Sales Net sales for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in thousands): % of % of 2005 Total 2004 Total Healthcare distribution (1): Dental (2) $ 1,896,643 40.9 % $ 1,602,457 41.1 % Medical (3) 1,394,121 30.1 1,284,279 33.0 International (4) 1,256,910 27.1 928,207 23.8 Total healthcare distribution 4,547,674 98.1 3,814,943 97.9 Technology (5) 88,255 1.9 83,542 2.1 Total $ 4,635,929 100.0 % $ 3,898,485 100.0 % (1) Consists of consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large dental equipment, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection control products and vitamins.

(4) Consists of products sold in the dental, medical and animal health markets, primarily in Europe. (5) Consists of practice management software and other value added products and services, which are sold primarily to healthcare providers in the United States and Canada. The $737.4 million, or 18.9%, increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes increases of 18.8% local currency growth (8.4% internally generated primarily due to volume growth and 10.4% from acquisitions) and 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange. The $294.2 million, or 18.4%, increase in dental net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes increases of 17.9% local currency growth (11.3% internally generated primarily due to increased volume and 6.6% from acquisitions) and 0.5% related to foreign currency exchange. The 17.9% local currency growth was due to dental consumable merchandise sales growth of 15.5% (9.2% internal growth and 6.3% from acquisitions) and dental equipment sales and service growth of 25.7% (18.2% internal growth and 7.5% from acquisitions). The $109.8 million, or 8.6%, increase in medical net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes increases of 8.6% local currency growth (7.6% internally generated, of which 4.1% was due to the absence of Fluvirin influenza vaccine in 2004, and 1.0% from acquisitions). The $328.7 million, or 35.4%, increase in international net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes increases of 35.7% in local currencies (30.9% from acquisitions, primarily of the Demedis Group, and 4.8% internally generated), offset by a 0.3% decline due to foreign currency exchange. The $4.7 million, or 5.6%, increase in technology net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes increases of 5.4% in local currency growth and 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange. The increase was driven by growth in electronic service, financial services and support/maintenance revenue. 36 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit and gross margins for 2005 and 2004 by segment and in total were as follows (in thousands): Gross Gross 2005 Margin % 2004 Margin % Healthcare distribution $ 1,249,836 27.5 % $ 992,537 26.0 % Technology 67,100 76.0 61,928 74.1 Total $ 1,316,936 28.4 $ 1,054,465 27.0 Gross profit increased $262.5 million, or 24.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit increased $257.3 million, or 25.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year period. Healthcare distribution gross profit margin increased to 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 26.0% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the absence of Fluvirin influenza vaccine in 2004. These increases reflect a focus on margin improvement, including the shedding of certain lower margin pharmaceutical products by our medical business. Technology gross profit increased $5.2 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year period. Technology gross profit margin increased to 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 74.1% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a change in sales mix reflecting a larger percentage of higher margin electronic and financial services sales and other cost improvements, largely in support.

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 22.7% from 22.1% for the comparable prior year period. This increase of 0.6% was primarily due to payroll and other expenses related to recent acquisitions, partially offset by the absence of the 2004 $13.2 million charge related to Fluvirin, as previously discussed. As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, selling expenses increased $141.6 million, or 25.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to payroll and other expenses related to recent acquisitions. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 15.2% from 14.5% for the comparable prior year period. As a component of total selling, general and administrative expenses, general and administrative expenses increased $49.9 million, or 16.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 from the prior year period. As a 37 Table of Contents percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.5% from 7.6% for the comparable prior year period primarily due to the absence of the 2004 $13.2 million charge related to Fluvirin. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net for the years ended 2005 and 2004 was as follows (in thousands): 2005 2004 Interest income $ 7,315 $ 6,110 Interest expense (25,508 ) (17,596 ) Other, net 1,659 365 Other expense, net $ (16,534 ) $ (11,121 ) Other expense, net increased $5.4 million to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from the comparable prior year period. This increase was primarily due to increased interest expense related to the costs of financing acquisitions along with increased interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest income. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2005, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 36.7% compared to 37.0% for the prior year period. The difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory rates for both periods primarily relates to state income taxes. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss of $11.3 million, net of tax, related to discontinued operations (see Note 6 in the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Net Income Net income increased $22.9 million, or 19.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year period. In 2005, net income includes an impairment charge related to long lived assets of discontinued operations of $7.0 million, net of tax. In 2004, net income includes a charge of $8.4 million, net of tax, related to Chiron Fluvirin. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock. Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy in opportunities, and payment terms for receivables and payables. Since sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year, our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year. We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities, debt placements and stock issuances. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for, and provision by our suppliers of, our products and services. Given current operating, economic and industry conditions, we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future. We do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $235.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to $254.8 million for the comparable prior year period. This net change of $19.5 million was due primarily to timing changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by increased net income. Net cash used in investing activities was $180.4 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to $206.7 million for the comparable prior year period. Net cash used in financing activities was $21.3 million for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $28.5 million for the prior year period. We expect to invest approximately $45.0 million to $50.0 million during 2007 in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations into our core structure. The following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources (in thousands): December 30, December 31, 2006 2005 (1) Cash and cash equivalents $ 248,647 $ 210,683 Available for sale securities 47,999 124,010 Working capital 834,760 860,295 Debt: Bank credit lines $ 2,528 $ 2,093 Current maturities of long term debt 41,036 33,013 Long term debt 455,806 489,520 Total debt $ 499,370 $ 524,626 (1) Adjusted to reflect our reclassification of $43.8 million of variable rate demand notes from cash and cash equivalents to available for sale securities within our consolidated balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds representing overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity. At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, our available for sale securities consisted of highly liquid tax efficient securities, including primarily auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes. Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy in opportunities and our desired level of 39 Table of Contents inventory. We anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continuing sales growth. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from continuing operations improved to 40.8 days as of December 30, 2006 from 41.8 days as of December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 30, 2006, we wrote off approximately $6.6 million of fully reserved accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve, which had no effect on our 2006 earnings. Our inventory turns from continuing operations decreased to 6.8 as of December 30, 2006 from 7.0 as of December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate long term debt, including interest (assuming an average long term rate of interest of 5.5%), as well as operating and capital lease obligations and inventory purchase commitments as of December 30, 2006: Payments due by period (in thousands) 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years Total Contractual obligations: Inventory purchase commitments $ 238,153 $ 349,816 $ 299,428 $ 568,708 $ 1,456,105 Long term debt, including interest 62,040 205,969 26,866 258,656 553,531 Operating lease obligations 48,764 69,831 40,106 57,752 216,453 Capital lease obligations, including interest 2,334 3,936 2,107 13,698 22,075 Interest rate swap agreements 3,200 3,638 235 7,073 Total $ 354,491 $ 633,190 $ 368,742 $ 898,814 $ 2,255,237 Inventory purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (formerly ID Biomedical Corporation), Novartis AG and the Sanofi Aventis Group through 2014 which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year. The amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions. In 2004, we completed an issuance of $240.0 million of convertible debt. These notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 3.0% and are due to mature on August 15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, which commenced on February 15, 2005. The notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 21.58 shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes, which is the equivalent conversion price of $46.34 per share, under the following circumstances: if the price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion price measured over a specified number of trading days; during the five business day period following any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10 trading day period was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes during that period; if the notes have been called for redemption; or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate transactions, as defined in the note agreement. Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock. We currently have sufficient availability of funds through our $300.0 million revolving credit 40 Table of Contents facility (discussed below) along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation. We also will pay contingent interest during any six month interest period beginning August 20, 2010, if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August 20, 2010. The note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August 15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029 or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event. Our $130.0 million senior notes are due on June 30, 2009 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.9% per annum. On September 25, 2006, we made our first annual principal payment of $20.0 million on our $100.0 million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.7% per annum. Principal payments are due annually on September 25, 2006 through 2010. Interest on both notes is payable semi annually. In 2003, we entered into agreements relating to our $230.0 million senior notes to exchange their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The value of debt exchanged to a variable rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes. As of December 30, 2006, there is $210.0 million of principal remaining with a weighted average interest rate of 8.1%. For the year ended December 30, 2006, the weighted average variable interest rate was 8.6%. This weighted average variable interest rate is comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes. On May 24, 2005, we entered into a $300.0 million revolving credit facility with a $100.0 million expansion feature. This facility, which expires in May 2010, replaced our previous revolving credit facility of $200.0 million, which was scheduled to expire in May 2006. As of December 30, 2006, there were $8.2 million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility. On June 21, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program. This program previously allowed us to repurchase up to $100.0 million in shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 3.5% of the shares outstanding on the announcement date. On October 31, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0 million of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program. As of December 30, 2006, we had repurchased $128.8 million or 3,373,142 shares under this initiative, with $71.2 million remaining for future common stock share repurchases. Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third party valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements, which approximates fair value. Additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met. We accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. Funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change. Consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs. E Commerce Traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. The advancement of online commerce will require us to cost effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to 41 Table of Contents address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties. Reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements: Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and animal health consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high volume, low dollar orders shipped using third party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable. Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post contract customer support for software, including annual support and or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided. Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit 42 Table of Contents worthiness and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. Inventory and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined primarily by the first in, first out method. In performing our lower of cost or market valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results. We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments (dental, medical (including animal health), international and technology). Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important, which could trigger an interim impairment review, include: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g. decision to divest a business); or significant negative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income. Supplier Rebates Supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned. The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. 43 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets Long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets. Definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. We previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by FAS 123(R), and accordingly, financial statement amounts for all prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair value method of expensing had been applied from the original effective date of FAS 123. Such results are consistent with our previously reported pro forma disclosures required under FAS 123. We measure stock based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of at the money stock options and restricted stock (including restricted stock units). We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options, stock price volatility, risk free interest rates and dividend yields. We issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipients continued service over time (four year cliff vesting) and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements (three year cliff vesting). With respect to time based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price. With respect to performance based restricted stock, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance measured against specified targets over a three year period. We estimate the fair value of performance based restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that performance targets will be achieved. Over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets. The ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets. Although we believe our judgments, estimates and or assumptions related to stock based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results. 44 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on future changes, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 123(R). FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over or under funded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status, net of tax through comprehensive income, in the year in which the changes occur. FAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The provisions of FAS 158 are effective for our year ended December 30, 2006, with the exception of the requirement to measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end, which is effective for our fiscal year ending December 27, 2008. During December 2006, we implemented the requirement to recognize the funded status of our retirement benefit plans. Recognizing the funded status of our defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risks, which include changes in interest rates, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S. dollar and each other. We attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts. These hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks. Factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments. All interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Swap Agreements We have fixed rate senior notes of $130.0 million at 6.9% and $80.0 million at 6.7%. During 2003, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of LIBOR plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements, as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements, we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.1 million. As of December 30, 2006, the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was $6.7 million, which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time. Changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and non current assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the $210.0 million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective. Net Investment Hedging During the year ended December 30, 2006, we implemented a change in our method of assessing the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in spot exchange rates. Previously, we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates. This change in method essentially converts certain U.S. LIBOR based borrowings to Euro LIBOR based borrowings, allowing us to better align our interest costs and the currency denomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests. With regard to all net investment hedging arrangements that existed at the time of this change, we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change. As a result, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $2.0 million, representing the foreign exchange component of our mark to market adjustment for the period from the date of change through December 30, 2006. Additionally, as a result of this change, we recognized a reduction in interest expense of approximately $2.8 million representing the interest rate component of our mark to market adjustment. Given current market conditions, we expect further reductions of interest expense into the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Agreements The value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar may affect our financial results. Fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and retained earnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars. Where we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings. We purchase short term (i.e., 12 months or less) foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of 46 Table of Contents merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers. We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic exposure. As of December 30, 2006, we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of $478.7 million, of which $420.2 million related to intercompany debt and $58.5 million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers. The contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar for Euros ($334.4 million), British Pounds ($34.8 million), Australian Dollars ($22.7 million), Swiss Francs ($1.1 million), Japanese Yen ($168.5 thousand) and Canadian Dollars ($5.3 million). In addition, our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies. The notional amount of such contracts was $80.2 million. A hypothetical 5% change of the value of the U.S. Dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by $20.6 million. As of December 30, 2006, the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements, which expire through January 2, 2008, recorded in other current liabilities was $8.7 million, as determined by quoted market prices. For the year ended December 30, 2006, we had realized net gains of $1.5 million and unrealized gains of $1.5 million relating to such agreements. 47 Table of Contents
