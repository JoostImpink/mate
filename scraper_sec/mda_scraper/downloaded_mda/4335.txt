Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Affinity was formed in 1994 to develop and market technologies that enable financial institutions and other businesses to provide consumer financial services electronically with reduced or no human intervention. Due to capital constraints, we have suspended efforts to deploy products and services that use our loan processing system, DeciSys/RT, in order to focus our efforts exclusively on attempting to license certain of our patents. Currently, our business activities consist exclusively of attempting to enter into license agreements with third parties to license our rights under certain of our patents and in pursuing patent litigation in an effort to protect our intellectual property and obtain recourse against alleged infringement of our patents. Accordingly, our prospects are wholly dependent on these efforts to finance and execute a sustainable patent licensing program. As more fully described above in Part I, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters" in conjunction with its product development activities, we applied for and obtained three patents, two of which cover fully automated loan processing systems and one of which covers the fully automated establishment of a financial account, including credit accounts.. All of these patents have been subject to reexamination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") as a result of third party challenges. It is possible that third parties may bring additional actions to contest all or some of our patents, and we can give no assurance that we will not lose all or some of the claims covered by our existing patents. In addition, as described more fully above in Part I, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters," we, and in some cases, alleged infringers of these patents, have initiated lawsuits to determine whether our patents are being infringed. In light of the most recent reexamination certificate issued in July 2006 regarding our third patent, these lawsuits are now proceeding. In December 2006, a "Markman Hearing" was held in connection with these infringement actions. Markman hearings are proceedings under U.S. patent law in which plaintiffs and defendants present their arguments to the court as to how they believe the patent claims which define the scope of the patent holders rights under the patent should be interpreted for purposes of determining at trial whether the patents have been infringed. For purposes of the Markman hearing, the Federated, TD Ameritrade and HSBC cases were consolidated into one hearing and held by the United States District Court for the State of South Carolina (the "Columbia Federal Court"). As a result of the Markman proceedings, the Columbia Federal Court interpreted and construed the meaning of numerous claim terms which bear on the scope of the patents. Although most claim terms were construed in a manner we believe are favorable, the trial judge interpreted and construed certain claim terms, most notably those related to the term "remote interface" as claimed in our second loan processing patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,940,811 C1) and our financial account patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,105,007 C1), in a manner unacceptable and unfavorable to us. In these patents, the Court interpreted and construed "remote interface" to mean computer equipment, including personal computer equipment, that is not owned by a consumer. The Court applied no such limitation in construing the term "remote interface" under our first loan processing patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,870,721 C1). Unless we can obtain a more favorable interpretation of certain claim terms, it is possible the scope of our patents could be significantly limited. In order to seek a reversal of these unfavorable Markman rulings, we will likely be required to appeal the rulings to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Moreover, we believe that an appeal of the Markman rulings will likely delay our current patent infringement lawsuits and hinder our ability to license our patents. Further, the appeal of the Markman rulings will likely require substantial resources and an extended period of time to complete, which will in turn likely increase the already significant costs and expected time required to prosecute our existing infringement actions. No assurance can be given that we will have the resources necessary to complete an appeal of the Markman rulings or our underlying lawsuits or that we will be successful in obtaining a favorable outcome. We also recently received an adverse ruling in our longstanding legal dispute with Temple Ligon, which is more fully described in Part I, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters." On October 30, 2006, the South Carolina Court of Appeals Court reversed the trial judges 2004 decision and reinstated the jury verdict of $382,148. Our petition to the Appeals Court for a rehearing of this case has been denied, and we intend to petition the South Carolina Supreme Court for relief from this ruling. 15 If we become obligated to pay more than an insignificant amount of damages in connection with this litigation, we could be forced to consider alternatives for winding down our business, which may include offering our patents for sale or filing for bankruptcy protection. To date, we have generated substantial operating losses and have been required to use a substantial amount of cash resources to fund our operations. Net cash used by operations during the year ended December 31, 2006, was $1,058,217, and at December 31, 2006, we had a working capital deficit of $34,451. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,026,978. We generally have been unable to enter into licensing agreements with potential licensees upon terms that are acceptable to us, and are pursuing litigation against alleged infringers, as described above and further in Part 1, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters." To pursue an appeal of unfavorable rulings issued in December 2006 in a Markman hearing, and to continue to vigorously pursue these lawsuits generally, we anticipate that it will need to increase our operating expenses due to, among other things, increased litigation costs and related expenses. Accordingly, to remain viable through 2007, it is critical that we raise additional capital through the sale of debt and or equity securities or from licensing our patents. No assurances can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate capital from our patent licensing business. Unless we raise additional capital, we may have to consider alternatives for winding down our business, which may include offering our patents for sale or filing for bankruptcy protection. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited financial statements included with this report contains a statement noting that our recent history of losses, combined with other factors, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although our plans to address these issues are discussed in Note 1 to the audited financial statements included in this report and elsewhere in this report, these plans are subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and we can give no assurance as to whether or how long we may be able to succeed in addressing these issues and maintaining our viability as a going concern. Critical Accounting Policies We apply certain accounting policies which are important in understanding our results of operations and the information presented in the consolidated financial statements. We consider critical accounting policies to be those that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and include the valuation reserve on net deferred tax assets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded a valuation allowance that reduced our deferred tax assets to zero. Results of Operations Revenues. Our revenues from continuing operations were $33,333, $20,261 and $287,298 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The types of revenue we recognized are as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of Total Total Total Patent license revenue $ 33,333 100.0 $ 20,261 100.0 $ 267,647 93.2 Other income 19,651 6.8 $ 33,333 100.0 $ 20,261 100.0 $ 287,298 100.0 Patent license revenue. We recognized patent licensing revenue of $33,333, $20,261 and $267,467 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized patent licensing revenue associated with the annual fee from one patent license agreement executed in 1999. Of the total amount recognized in 2004, $250,000 was non recurring revenue related to a settlement agreement with an institution that formerly maintained a system that permitted consumers to apply for credit cards over the Internet. 16 Other income. In 2006 and 2005, we recognized no amounts classified as other income. In 2004, other income consisted exclusively of non recurring miscellaneous income items primarily associated with the sale of equipment no longer needed in the operation of our business. Costs and Expenses Costs of Revenues. Costs of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $3,333 $2,026 and $64,265, respectively. Cost of revenues consists of commissions paid to our patent licensing agents. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2,606,386, compared to $486,607 and $732,285 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. G&A expenses have fluctuated significantly over the past three years and depend to a great extent on the level of our business activities and particularly, the level of litigation in which we are involved in a period. The components of G&A expenses incurred in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Amount % of Amount % of Amount % of Total Total Total Salaries and benefits $ 268,381 10.3 $ 248,415 51.1 $ 271,777 37.1 Stock based compensation 874,081 33.5 Professional fees 971,773 37.3 138,768 28.5 321,135 43.9 Litigation accrual 382,148 14.7 Insurance 47,078 1.8 54,251 11.1 55,273 7.6 Rent 20,518 0.8 25,820 5.3 40,534 5.5 Other 42,407 1.6 19,353 4.0 43,566 5.9 $2,606,386 100.0 $ 486,607 100.0 $ 732,285 100.0 G&A expenses increased $2,119,779 in 2006 compared to 2005. As indicated in the above table, G&A expenses increased $2,089,234 as a result of an increase in stock compensation, professional fees and a litigation accrual. In 2006, we issued options to our executives and directors in conjunction with a non qualified option plan adopted by our Board of Directors. We also issued warrants to our investment advisor for services associated with the investment advisors assistance in raising capital and other advisory services. As a result of the option and warrant grants, we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense of $874,081. Professional fees increased $833,005 in 2006 compared to 2005, most of which was related to our patent infringement lawsuits. In March 2006, we were notified by the PTO that the reexamination of our U.S. Patent No. 6,105,007 had been concluded. The conclusion of the reexamination resulted in the lifting of the stays of our patent infringement lawsuits with Federated, TD Ameritrade and HSBC. The lawsuits proceeded during the remainder of 2006 with a corresponding increase in legal and other professional fees. We also accrued $382,148 to reflect the reinstatement by the South Carolina Court of Appeals of a jury verdict previously set aside by the trial judge in 2004. The decrease in G&A in 2005 compared to 2004 is due to the continued reduction of our activities and curtailment of other expenses in 2005 and 2004, primarily as a result of the granting by the PTO of a request to reexamine our U.S. Patent No. 6,105,007 in 2004. As a result of the reexamination, our patent infringement lawsuits were stayed and we implemented measures to conserve our financial resources until the reexamination was concluded. G&A expenses were lower in all material categories in 2005 compared to 2004. Professional fees decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily as a result of the costs of our defense associated with the civil action brought by Temple Ligon and which case was tried in 2004. Interest Income Interest income was $17,907, $182 and $1,967 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and primarily reflects interest income attributable to our cash balances. 17 The increase in interest income in 2006, is related to the interest earned on cash balances associated with the sale of our convertible notes in September 2006 in the aggregate principal amount of $1,905,000. Interest Expense Interest expense was $141,043, $98,197 and $95,990 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense is primarily associated with the interest on $3,480,336 aggregate principal amount of convertible notes issued in installments in June 2002 ($830,336), March 2003 ($200,000), August 2003 ($25,000), November 2003 ($150,000), December 2003 ($50,000), January 2004 ($25,000), May 2005 ($75,000), August 2005 ($45,000) and December 2005 ($25,000), May 2006 ($150,000) and September 2006 ($1,905,000). Of the aggregate note principal issued, aggregate principal in the amount of $568,697 has been converted into shares of our common stock. Additionally, in August 2006, and in accordance with the issuance of new notes in satisfaction of our then outstanding notes, $229,027 of accrued interest was converted into note principal. The increase in interest expense in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2005 compared to 2004 is attributable to the increase in the average amounts of the convertible notes outstanding. Litigation Accrual Reversal We have been a defendant in a lawsuit which resulted in a jury verdict against us in January 2004. We had recorded a reserve in 2003 for the estimated loss in this litigation of $386,148 as a result of the jury verdict. In July 2004, the trial judge ruled on post trial motions submitted by us and set aside the jury verdict, and accordingly, in the third quarter of 2004, the Company reversed the $386,148 accrual and recognized a like amount as other income. As discussed above under the caption "General and Administrative Expenses," the South Carolina Court of Appeals reinstated the jury verdict in 2006. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, based on managements evaluation of the recognition criteria as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Liquidity and Capital Resources We have generated net losses of $71,943,941 since our inception and have financed our operations primarily through net proceeds from our initial public offering in May 1996 and cash generated from operations and other financing transactions. Net proceeds from our initial public offering were $60,088,516. Net cash used by operations during the year ended December 31, 2006, was $1,058,217, compared to $194,285 and $557,545 used by operations in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash used by operations in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily the result of an increase in professional fees associated with our patent litigation. Our patent lawsuits were stayed in 2004 and during 2005 pending the conclusion of the reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 6,105,007, our patent covering the automated establishment of financial accounts. As discussed in Part 1, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters," the reexamination was concluded in 2006, the stay of the lawsuits was lifted and the lawsuits proceeded. The decrease in cash used by operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to additional cost reduction measures taken by us in 2005 and the deferral of the payment of certain accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2004 until 2005 and the expense of a civil action against us incurred in 2004. At December 31, 2006 cash and liquid investments were $1,026,978, as compared to $13,776 at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006 working capital was a deficit of $34,451 as compared to a deficit of $1,992,056 at December 31, 2005. For purposes of determining working capital at December 31, 2005, $1,595,906 of principal and accrued interest under our convertible notes are included as current liabilities. To date, we have generated substantial operating losses and have been required to use a substantial amount of cash resources to fund our operations. We generally have been unable to enter into licensing agreements with potential licensees upon terms that are acceptable to the Company, and are pursuing litigation against alleged infringers, as described above and further in Part 1, Item 1, "Business Patents and Legal Matters." 18 To pursue an appeal of unfavorable rulings issued in December 2006 in a Markman hearing, and to continue to vigorously pursue these lawsuits generally, we anticipate that we will need to increase our operating expenses due to, among other things, increased litigation costs and related expenses. Accordingly, to remain viable through 2007, it is critical that we raise additional capital through the sale of debt and or equity securities or from licensing our patents. No assurances can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate capital from our patent licensing business. Unless we raise additional capital, we may have to consider alternatives for winding down our business, which may include offering our patents for sale or filing for bankruptcy protection. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited financial statements included with this report contains a statement noting that our recent history of losses, combined with other factors, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Although our plans to address these issues are discussed in Note 1 to the audited financial statements included in this report and elsewhere in this report, these plans are subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and we can give no assurance as to whether or how long we may be able to succeed in addressing these issues and maintaining our viability as a going concern. In 2002, we initiated a convertible note program under which we were authorized to issue up to $1,500,000 principal amount of our 8% convertible secured notes (the "notes"). In February 2006, the convertible note program was amended to allow us to issue up to $3,000,000 of our notes. Prior to August 2006, we had issued an aggregate of $1,575,336 principal amount of notes under this program, including notes with an aggregate principal amount of $536,336 that have been converted into shares of our common stock. These notes bear interest at 8%, are convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of $.20 per share (for notes issued prior to the April 2006 amendment to the program) or $.50 per share (for notes issued in May 2006), and are secured by our equity interest in our decisioning.com, Inc. subsidiary, which owns our patent portfolio. Principal and interest under these notes generally becomes payable in full on the second anniversary of the date on which these notes were issued. However, under the terms of the notes, the full amount of principal and interest under all notes may be declared immediately due and payable in certain events, including bankruptcy or similar proceedings involving us, a default in the payment of principal and interest under any note, or a change in control of the Company. From June 2004 through August 2006, we were in default regarding payment of principal and interest due under certain of the notes. Accordingly, the full amount of principal and interest outstanding under all notes was payable at the option of all noteholders. At December 31, 2005, the amount of principal and accrued interest outstanding under all of the notes was $1,595,906. In August 2006, we and the holders of all outstanding notes entered into an amended and restated note purchase agreement under which such holders agreed to extend the maturity date of such notes by exchanging them (including all interest accrued thereon) for new two year notes due in August 2008 in the aggregate principal amount of $1,268,027. Under the amended note purchase agreement, we may issue notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to $5,000,000 (including the notes issued to current noteholders, as described in the preceding sentence) having an exercise price determined by us and each investor at the time of issuance. The new notes issued in August 2006 have the same terms as the old notes for which they were exchanged, except that the new notes will mature in August 2008. Of the new notes issued, notes with a principal amount of $1,115,068 are convertible into shares of our common stock at $.20 per share, and notes with a principal amount of $152,959 are convertible into shares of our common stock at $.50 per share. The new notes include a note in the principal amount of $166,863 issued to our Chief Executive Officer and a note in the principal amount of $122,115 issued to a subsidiary of The South Financial Group. The South Financial Group Foundation, a non profit foundation established by the South Financial Group, owns approximately 10% of the Companys outstanding capital stock. In September 2006, we sold additional convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,905,000. 19 The terms of these notes are the same as the notes previously issued by us, except that they may be converted into our common stock at a rate of $.42 per share, and we have agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on or before January 31, 2007, a registration statement with respect to out common stock issuable upon conversion of these notes. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our long term debt and other obligations at December 31, 2006. Payment Due By Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Convertible Notes (1) $ 3,225,089 $ $ 3,225,089 $ $ Operating Lease Obligations 1,200 1,200 Purchase Obligations Total $ 3,226,289 $ 1,200 $ 3,225,089 $ $ (1) Convertible notes consist of the Companys convertible notes, including accrued interest.
