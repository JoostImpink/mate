Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this Report. General Tompkins Trustco, Inc., ("Tompkins" or the "Company") is headquartered in Ithaca, New York and is registered as a Financial Holding Company with the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company conducts its business through its three wholly owned banking subsidiaries, Tompkins Trust Company (the "Trust Company"), The Bank of Castile and The Mahopac National Bank ("Mahopac National Bank"), through its wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Tompkins Insurance Agencies, Inc. ("Tompkins Insurance"), and through its wholly owned financial planning and wealth management subsidiary, AM&M Financial Services, Inc. (AM&M). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" refers to Tompkins Trustco, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Companys principal offices are located at The Commons, Ithaca, New York, 14851, and its telephone number is (607) 273 3210. The Companys common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the Symbol "TMP." Tompkins was organized in 1995, under the laws of the State of New York, as a bank holding company for the Trust Company, a commercial bank that has operated in Ithaca and surrounding communities since 1836. On December 31, 1999, the Company completed a merger with Letchworth Independent Bancshares Corporation ("Letchworth"), at which time Letchworth was merged with and into Tompkins. Upon completion of the merger, Letchworths two subsidiary banks, The Bank of Castile and Mahopac National Bank, became subsidiaries of Tompkins. On January 6, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of AM&M Financial Services, Inc. (AM&M), a fee based financial planning firm headquartered in Pittsford, New York. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of AM&M stock for an initial merger consideration of $2,375,000 in cash and 59,377 shares of Tompkins common stock. In addition to the merger consideration paid at closing, additional contingent amounts of up to $8.5 million (payable one half in cash and one half in Tompkins shares) may be paid over a period of four years from closing, depending on the operating results of AM&M. AM&M met the income targets in 2006, resulting in an estimated payout of $2.5 million. The contingent payment will be recorded as additional goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 141. As of December 31, 2006, the transaction has resulted in intangible assets of $7.1 million, including goodwill of $6.0 million, customer related intangible of $968,000, and a covenant not to compete of $108,000. The customer related intangible and the covenant not to compete are being amortized over 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the Companys financial statements include the activity of AM&M effective January 6, 2006. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the years prior to 2006 do not include the operations of AM&M. AM&M operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. It has three operating companies: (1) AM&M Planners, Inc., which provides fee based financial planning and wealth management services for corporate executives, small business owners and high net worth individuals; (2) Ensemble Financial Services, Inc., an independent broker dealer and leading outsourcing company for financial planners and investment advisors; and (3) Ensemble Risk Solutions, Inc., which creates customized risk management plans using life, disability and long term care insurance products. The Company also continued to expand its insurance business in 2006, with the acquisition of four insurance agencies in New York. The acquisitions include the Farrell Messler Agency in Trumansburg, New York (March 2006), certain assets of Potter Enterprises of WNY, Inc. in Orchard Park, New York (April 2006), the Kemp Agency in Dansville and Nunda, New York (July 2006), and the Carey McKinney Group in Ithaca, New York (December 2006). Additional information on these acquisitions is provided in "Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report. Narrative Description of Business Information about the Companys business segments is included in Note 19 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The Company has identified two business segments, banking and financial services. Financial services activities consist of the results of the Companys trust, financial planning and wealth management, broker dealer services, and risk management operations. All other activities are considered banking. Banking services consist primarily of attracting deposits from the areas served by the Companys banking subsidiaries 37 banking offices and using those deposits to originate a variety of commercial loans, consumer loans, real estate loans, and leases in those same areas. Residential real estate mortgage loans are generally underwritten in accordance with Federal Home Loan Mortgage 1 Corporation (FHLMC) guidelines, which enhances the liquidity of these lending products. The Companys subsidiary banks have sold residential mortgage loans to FHLMC over the past several years to manage exposure to changing interest rates and to take advantage of favorable market conditions. The Companys subsidiary banks retain the servicing of the loans sold to FHLMC and record a servicing asset at the time of sale. For additional details on loan sales, refer to "Note 4 Loan/Lease Classification Summary and Related Party Transactions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report. The Companys lending function is managed within the guidelines of a comprehensive Board approved lending policy. Policies and procedures are reviewed on a regular basis. Reporting systems are in place to provide management with ongoing information related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans. The Company has an independent loan review process that reviews and validates the risk identification and assessment made by the lenders and credit personnel. The results of these reviews are presented to the Board of Directors of each of the Companys banking subsidiaries. The Companys principal expenses are interest on deposits, interest on borrowings, and operating and general administrative expenses, as well as provisions for loan/lease losses. Funding sources, other than deposits, include borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and cash flow from lending and investing activities. Tompkins provides a variety of financial services to individuals and small business customers. Some of the traditional banking services and financial services are detailed below. Commercial Services The Companys subsidiary banks provide financial services to corporations and other business clients. Lending activities include loans for a variety of business purposes, including real estate financing, construction, equipment financing, accounts receivable financing, and commercial leasing. Other commercial services include deposit and cash management services, letters of credit, sweep accounts, credit cards, purchasing cards, and Internet based account services. Retail Services The Companys subsidiary banks provide a variety of retail banking services including checking accounts, savings accounts, time deposits, IRA products, brokerage services, residential mortgage loans, personal loans, home equity loans, credit cards, debit cards and safe deposit services. Retail services are accessible through a variety of delivery systems including branch facilities, ATMs, voice response, and Internet banking. In 2006, the Company expanded its retail brokerage services and also added remote deposit services, a convenient new service that brings deposit capability to an individuals desk any time of the day or night. Securities Portfolio The Company maintains a portfolio of securities such as U.S. government and agency securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, equity securities, and interest bearing deposits. Management typically invests in securities with short to intermediate average lives in order to better match the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities. Investment decisions are made within policy guidelines established by the Companys Board of Directors. The investment policy established by the Companys Board of Directors is based on the asset/liability management goals of the Company, and is monitored by the Companys Asset/Liability Management Committee. The intent of the policy is to establish a portfolio of high quality diversified securities, which optimizes net interest income within safety and liquidity limits deemed acceptable by the Asset/Liability Management Committee. Securities, other than certain obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, are classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale may be used to enhance total return, provide additional liquidity, or reduce interest rate risk. Trust and Investment Management Services The Company provides trust and investment services through Tompkins Investment Services (TIS), a division of Tompkins Trust Company, and investment services through AM&M. Tompkins Investment Services, with office locations at all three of the Companys subsidiary banks, provides a full range of money management services, including investment management accounts, custody accounts, trusts, retirement plans and rollovers, estate settlement, and financial planning. AM&M provides fee based financial planning for small business owners, professionals and corporate executives and other individuals with complex financial needs. AM&M also provides wealth management services and operates a broker dealer subsidiary, which is a leading outsourcing company for financial planners and investment advisors. The Company also expanded its retail brokerage services in 2006. Insurance Services The Company provides property and casualty insurance services through Tompkins Insurance and AM&M. Tompkins Insurance is an independent insurance agency, representing several major insurance carriers with access to special risk property and liability markets. Tompkins Insurance has automated systems for record keeping, claim processing and coverage confirmation, and can provide insurance pricing comparisons from some of the countrys finest insurance companies. In addition to its seven stand alone offices, Tompkins Insurance shares several offices with The Bank of Castile and The Trust Company. AM&M operates a subsidiary that creates customized risk management plans using life, disability and long term care insurance products. 2 Subsidiaries The Company operates three banking subsidiaries, an insurance agency subsidiary, and effective January 6, 2006, a financial planning and wealth management subsidiary in New York. The Companys subsidiary banks operate 37 offices, including 1 limited service office, serving communities in New York. The decision to operate as three locally managed community banks reflects managements commitment to community banking as a business strategy. For Tompkins, personal delivery of high quality services, a commitment to the communities in which we operate, and the convergence of a single source financial service provider characterize managements community banking approach. The combined resources of the Tompkins organization provides increased capacity for growth and greater capital resources necessary to make investments in technology and services. Tompkins has developed several specialized financial services that are now available in markets served by all three subsidiary banks. These services include trust and investment services, insurance, leasing, card services, and Internet banking. In 2006, the Company opened Tompkins Financial Center, in Ithaca, New York. This facility will have house representatives from the banks lending function, Tompkins Insurance and AM&M. The Company opened a similar facility in Batavia, New York in 2004. Tompkins Trust Company ("Tompkins Trust Company") Tompkins Trust Company is a commercial bank that has operated in Ithaca, New York and surrounding communities since 1836. The Trust Company operates 13 full service and 1 limited service banking offices in the counties of Tompkins, Cortland, Cayuga and Schuyler, New York. Tompkins Trust Companys market area consists primarily of Tompkins County, New York with population of approximately 100,000. The majority of Tompkins Trust Companys 13 full service offices are located within Tompkins County. Education plays a significant role in the local economy with Cornell University and Ithaca College being two of the countys major employers. Current economic trends include low unemployment and moderate growth. Tompkins Trust Company has a full service office in Cortland, New York and a full service office in Auburn, New York. Both of these offices are located in counties contiguous to Tompkins County. The Bank of Castile ("The Bank of Castile") The Bank of Castile conducts its operations through its 14 full service offices, in towns situated in and around the areas commonly known as the Letchworth State Park area and the Genesee Valley region of New York State. The Bank of Castile serves a five county market that is primarily rural in nature. The Company opened a new banking office in 2006 in Greece, New York. This new office provides additional access to the suburban Rochester, New York, market. Excluding Monroe County, which includes Rochester, the population of the counties served by The Bank of Castile is approximately 212,000. Economic growth has been relatively flat in The Bank of Castiles market area, although the significant population base of the suburban Rochester market (in excess of 700,000 people) provides continued opportunities for growth. Mahopac National Bank ("Mahopac National Bank") Mahopac National Bank is located in Putnam County, New York and operates 5 full service offices in that county, 3 full service offices in Dutchess County, New York and 1 full service office in Westchester County, New York. Mahopac National Bank opened two new banking offices in 2006. The Southeast Office (March 2006) is located in Putnam County. The Wappinger Falls Office (December 2006) is located in Dutchess County. Mahopac National Bank also relocated its Hopewell Office to a larger facility in 2006. The primary market area for Mahopac National Bank is Putnam County, with a population of approximately 100,000. Putnam County is about 60 miles north of Manhattan, and is one of the fastest growing counties in New York State. Mahopac National Banks Hopewell Junction and LaGrange offices are located in Dutchess County, which has a population of approximately 280,000. Mahopac National Banks Mount Kisco office is located in Westchester County, which has a population of 916,000. Tompkins Insurance Agencies, Inc. ("Tompkins Insurance") Tompkins Insurance is headquartered in Batavia, New York, and offers property and casualty insurance to individuals and businesses primarily in Western New York. Over the past several years, Tompkins Insurance has acquired smaller insurance agencies generally in the market areas serviced by the Companys banking subsidiaries. Tompkins Insurance offers services to customers of the Companys banking subsidiaries by sharing offices with The Bank of Castile and The Trust Company. In addition, to these shared offices, Tompkins Insurance has five stand alone offices in Western New York, and two stand alone offices in Tompkins County, including The Carey McKinney Group located in Ithaca, New York, effective December 31, 2006. 3 AM&M Financial Services, Inc. ("AM&M") AM&M is headquartered in Pittsford, New York and offers fee based financial planning services through three operating companies: (1) AM&M Planners, Inc., which provides fee based financial planning and wealth management services for corporate executives, small business owners and high net worth individuals; (2) Ensemble Financial Services, Inc., an independent broker dealer and leading outsourcing company for financial planners and investment advisors; and (3) Ensemble Risk Solutions, Inc., which creates customized risk management plans using life, disability and long term care insurance products. AM&M has 44 employees. Competition Competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the Companys market areas. The deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi bank holding companies, as well as an increasing level of interstate banking, have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking. In one or more aspects of its business, the Companys subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Companys non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and Federally insured banks. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Management believes that a community bank is better positioned to establish personalized banking relationships with both commercial customers and individual households. The Companys community commitment and involvement in its primary market areas, as well as its commitment to quality and personalized banking services, are factors that contribute to the Companys competitiveness. Management believes that each of the Companys subsidiary banks can compete successfully in its primary market areas by making prudent lending decisions quickly and more efficiently than its competitors, without compromising asset quality or profitability, although no assurances can be given that such factors will assure success. Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Agencies As a registered financial holding company, the Company is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The Companys banking subsidiaries are subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the New York State Banking Department (NYSBD). Each of these agencies issues regulations and requires the filing of reports describing the activities and financial condition of the entities under its jurisdiction. Likewise, such agencies conduct examinations on a recurring basis to evaluate the safety and soundness of the institutions, and to test compliance with various regulatory requirements, including: consumer protection, privacy, fair lending, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, sales of non deposit investments, electronic data processing, and trust department activities. The Companys financial services subsidiaries are subject to examination and regulation by various regulatory agencies, including the New York State Insurance Department, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). Tompkins Investment Services is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory authorities, including the FDIC and NYSBD. Share Repurchases and Dividends Under FRB regulations, the Company may not, without providing prior notice to the FRB, purchase or redeem its own common stock if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to ten percent or more of the Companys consolidated net worth. FRB policy provides that dividends shall not be paid except out of current earnings and unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the Company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Tompkins primary source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock is dividends from its subsidiary banks. The subsidiary banks are subject to regulations that restrict the dividends that they may pay to Tompkins. Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions FDIC insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to and FDIC insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company that is in danger of default. "Default" means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. "In danger of default" means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. 4 Intercompany Transactions There are Federal laws and regulations that govern transactions between the Companys non bank subsidiaries and its banking subsidiaries. These laws establish certain quantitative limits and other prudent requirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between a member bank and its affiliates. Capital Adequacy The FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC have promulgated capital adequacy guidelines that are considered by these agencies in examining and supervising a bank or bank holding company, and in analyzing any applications a bank or bank holding company may submit to the appropriate agency. In addition, for supervisory purposes, these agencies have promulgated regulations establishing five categories of capitalization, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized, depending upon the level of capitalization and other factors. Currently, the Company and its subsidiary banks maintain leverage and risk based capital ratios above the required levels and are considered well capitalized under applicable regulations. A comparison of the Companys capital ratios and the various regulatory requirements is included in "Note 17 Regulations and Supervision" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report on Form 10 K. Deposit Insurance All deposit accounts of the Companys subsidiary banks are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"), generally in amounts up to $100,000 per depositor. Legislation, discussed below, was passed in 2006 that increased insurance coverage for certain self directed retirement accounts to $250,000 and indexed insurance levels for inflation. Deposit insurance coverage is maintained by payment of premiums assessed to banks insured by the DIF. The FDIC uses a risk based assessment system that determines insurance premiums based upon a banks capital level and supervisory rating. Based on capital strength and favorable FDIC risk classifications, the Companys subsidiary banks are not currently subject to BIF insurance assessments. In February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (collectively the "Reform Act") were signed into law. The Reform Act provided for the merging of the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund into the new DIF, effective March 31, 2006. Under the Reform Act, the FDIC has modified its risk based deposit premium assessment system under which each depository institution is placed in one of four assessment categories based on the institutions capital classification under the prompt corrective action provisions and an institutions long term debt issuer ratings. Effective January 1, 2007, the adjusted assessment rates for insured institutions under the modified system range from .05% to .43% depending upon the assessment category into which the insured institution is placed. Under the previous assessment system, the adjusted assessment rates ranged from .00% to .27%. The Reform Act provides for a one time assessment credit for eligible insured depository institutions (those institutions that were in existence on December 31, 1996 and paid a deposit insurance assessment prior to that date, or are a successor to any such institution). The credit is determined based on the assessment base of the institution as of December 31, 1996 as compared with the combined aggregate assessment base of all eligible institutions as of that date. The credit may be used to offset up to 100% of the 2007 DIF assessment, and if not completely used in 2007, may be applied to not more than 90% of each of the aggregate 2008, 2009 and 2010 DIF assessments. The insurance assessments under the Reform Act are not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the Companys subsidiary banks in 2007 or 2008. Depositor Preference The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC, as subrogee of the insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institutions. Community Reinvestment Act The Companys subsidiary banks are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and to certain fair lending and reporting requirements that relate to home mortgage lending. The CRA requires the federal banking regulators to assess the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of the local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank. The federal agencies consider an institutions performance under the CRA in evaluating applications for mergers and acquisitions, and new offices. The ratings assigned by the federal agencies are publicly disclosed. 5 Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting requirements for companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements include: (1) requirements for audit committees, including independence and financial expertise; (2) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company; (3) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4) disclosure and reporting requirements for the reporting company and directors and executive officers; and (5) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of securities laws. The USA Patriot Act The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) imposes obligations on financial institutions, including banks and broker dealer subsidiaries to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism Employees At December 31, 2006, the Company employed 702 employees, approximately 79 of whom were part time. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes its employee relations are excellent.

Item 1A. Risk Factors The Companys business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow may be impacted by numerous factors, including but not limited to those discussed below. These items may cause the Companys results to vary materially from recent results. Interest Rate Risk The Companys earnings, financial condition and liquidity are susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates. Net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings, is the largest component of the Companys total revenues. The level of net interest income is dependent upon the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the level of nonperforming assets, and the level and trend of interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of prepayments on the Companys loans and payments on mortgage backed securities, resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage backed security being prepaid. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including: inflation, economic growth, employment levels, monetary policy and international markets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the Companys earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. The Company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods. Each quarter the Companys Asset/Liability Management Committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels. The Committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the Company. In addition, the Company has focused on expanding its fee based business as a percentage of revenues to help mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. For additional information about how the Company manages its interest rate risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" of this Report. 6 Credit Risk The Companys business of originating and underwriting loans involves credit risk, which is the risk of loss of principal or interest because borrowers, guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. The Company has adopted comprehensive credit policies, underwriting standards and loan review procedures and maintains a reserve for loan/lease losses to mitigate credit losses. The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for loan/lease losses on a regular basis to ensure that the allowance is adequate to cover the estimated loss exposure in its portfolio. Management believes that it has established policies and procedures that are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss. Nonetheless, these policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. See Part II, Item 7, "Loans/Leases" and "The Allowance for Loan/Lease Losses" of this Report for further discussion of the lending portfolio and the allowance for loan/lease losses. Government Laws and Regulations The Company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, supervision, and legislation that affect how it conducts its business. The majority of these laws and regulations are for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. Any changes to state and federal banking laws and regulations may negatively impact the Companys ability to expand services and to increase shareholder value. There can also be significant cost related to compliance with various laws and regulations. The Company has established an extensive internal control structure to ensure compliance with governing laws and regulations, including those related to financial reporting. Refer to "Supervision and Regulation" for additional information on laws and regulations. The Federal Reserves monetary policies also affect the Companys operating results and financial condition. These policies, which include open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits, can have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return earned on loans and investments. The Company is subject to state and federal tax laws and regulations. Changes to these regulations could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets. The fiscal 2007 budget for New York proposes a change in the tax treatment for certain real estate investment trusts (REIT). Each of the Companys banking subsidiaries is a majority owner in a REIT. If the proposed change is passed in its current form, it may have a negative impact on the Companys tax expense. Competition Competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the Companys market areas. The deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi bank holding companies, as well as an increasing level of interstate banking, have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking. In one or more aspects of its business, the Companys subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Companys non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and Federally insured banks. The Company focuses on providing unparalleled customer service, which includes offering a strong suite of products and services. Economic Conditions General economic conditions have an impact on the banking industry. The Companys operating results depend on providing products and services to customers in our local market areas. Unemployment rates, real estate values, demographic changes, property tax rates, and local and state governments have an impact on local and regional economic conditions. An increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values, an increase in property tax rates, or a decrease in population could weaken the local economies in which the Company operates. Weak economic conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to repayment ability and collateral protection. The Company operates in three primary market areas which mitigates the impact on local economic conditions and has focused on providing a full suite of products to increase its fee based business as a percentage of total revenues. Operational Risk The Company is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. The Company depends upon data processing, software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the Internet. Despite instituted safeguards, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Company could be exposed to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for exposures that are insurable. The Company regularly tests internal controls to ensure that they are appropriate and functioning as designed. 7 Technological Development and Changes The financial services industry is subject to rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services. In addition to improving the Companys ability to serve customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiencies and helps to maintain or reduce expenses. The Companys ability to keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial industry and to introduce new products and services based on this new technology will be important to the Companys continued success.
