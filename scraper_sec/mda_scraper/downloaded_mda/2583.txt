KSW, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "KSW"), furnishes and installs heating, ventilating and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems and process piping systems for institutional, industrial, commercial, high rise residential and public works projects. The Company does not actively pursue projects under $3,000,000. The Company also serves as a mechanical trade manager, performing project management services relating to the mechanical trades. The Company conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. ("KSW Mechanical"). The Companys common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") under the symbol "KSW". Some of the Companys ongoing projects include: Cardiovascular Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital, the conversions from office space to residential rental apartments in lower Manhattan at 40 Broad Street, in Brooklyn at 360 Furman Street, and new high rise luxury buildings in Manhattan at Fifteen Central Park West, 170 East End Avenue, 206 East 86th Street, 1330 First Avenue, the residential/hotel complex at 123 Washington Street and the hotel/condo project at 246 Spring Street. The Company is not currently performing work on projects in the public sector. The Companys primary strategic objectives are to increase its revenues and profitability in its present business. The Company may look to expand its business into new geographic areas in the Northeastern United States or acquire businesses which would be complementary to its current line of business. The Company may also pursue acquisitions outside its current lines of business for greater diversification. The Companys primary business is providing HVAC and process piping systems under direct contracts with owners of buildings or subcontracts with general contractors or construction managers. Historically, some of these contracts were awarded through competitive bids, as some of the owners were public entities. During 2006, the Company has focused on the favorable New York City private construction market and has been successful in obtaining projects from private owners and construction companies by utilizing its value engineering and trade management skills. Many of these projects are obtained from repeat customers, who invite the Company to participate in the project while it is still in the design phase, or to assist in bringing a projects budget in line with the customers requirements. The Company provides value engineering assistance, whereby the Company uses its experienced staff to recommend economical changes to streamline HVAC and process piping systems. These changes reduce costs, but still yield the same results as the original plans. The Companys ability to provide this service has become increasingly recognized in the industry and has resulted in the Companys ability to secure projects without bidding against competitors. The Company believes that this service provides additional bidding opportunities in the future. 3 The Companys management pioneered the concept of managing the mechanical trade portion of large construction projects. On larger complex projects (generally those having a mechanical portion valued at over $10,000,000), such as the Cardiovascular Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Ambulatory Care Facility, Morgan Stanley Childrens Hospital at New York Presbyterian and the Long Island Jewish Hospital Energy Center, it is often beneficial for a construction manager to lock in the costs of the mechanical portion of the contract prior to completion of the contract documents. By engaging the services of a trade manager, the Company believes construction managers can more accurately evaluate design alternatives so that the completed construction documents balance costs and project objectives. As a mechanical trade manager, the Company performs a construction manager function for the mechanical trade portion of a project. The Company divides the mechanical portion of the contract into bid packages for subcontractors and equipment, negotiates subcontracts and coordinates the work. The Company believes coordination provides a significant benefit in keeping a project on schedule and within budget. As a mechanical trade manager, the Company may subcontract parts of a large project to different subcontractors, thereby increasing competition on projects and lowering bids by allowing smaller contractors to compete for the subcontract work. On some projects, the Company may self perform a portion of the work for a fixed price. The Company believes customers benefit by having a single source responsible for the cost, coordination and progress of the mechanical portion of the projects. Although trade management is typically available only on large jobs, the Company believes there is opportunity for expanding this line of business. On trade management projects, the Company provides a guaranteed maximum price ("GMP") to its customer for its scope of responsibility. The Company controls the GMP by obtaining price quotes from potential suppliers and subcontractors, requiring payment or performance bonds from major subcontractors and adding a contingency allowance to these price quotes before the Company submits its GMP. The Company also works to control costs because it is a mechanical contractor and can perform some of the guaranteed work on its own should bid prices exceed its estimate. These costs are subject to certain risk factors discussed in "Item 1A Risk Factors". While trade management projects provide a net profit margin lower than that for contracting projects, the Company believes there is generally less risk associated with trade management projects because there is a contingency fund which can be drawn from if necessary. A contingency fund is a line item which the Company includes in the GMP to account for any contingencies the Company may not have anticipated in estimating the GMP. In the event the Companys costs exceed the relevant line items quoted in the GMP, the Company may draw from the contingency fund to cover such expenses. The Company is at risk for any costs in excess of the GMP. There is no assurance that potential cost overruns will not exceed this contingency. Operations. Historically, the Company has obtained projects primarily through negotiations with private owners, construction managers and general contractors and by competitive bidding and negotiations in response to advertisements by federal, state and local governmental agencies. During 2006, the Company has not bid on public projects, but has obtained projects in the private sector by working with owners, developers, construction companies and design professionals on a cooperative basis. The Companys ability to suggest 4 alternative design concepts has allowed its customers to reduce their cost of projects. By providing value engineering and trade management services the Company has been able to secure contracts without participating in a competitive bidding process. For all projects, the Company develops a comprehensive project budget using what it believes is a proven cost estimating system. Projects are divided into phases and line items indicating separate labor, equipment, material, subcontractor and overhead cost estimates. As a project progresses, the Companys project managers are responsible for planning, scheduling and overseeing operations and reviewing project costs compared to the estimates. The Companys costs have been and may in the future be impacted by lower than expected labor productivity and higher than expected material costs. While the Company is not actively pursuing projects in the public sector at this time, it has received letters of approval as an authorized bidder by various government agencies, including the New York City Transit Authority, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the New York City School Construction Authority, the New York City Housing Authority and the New York State Dormitory Authority. Markets. The Company competes for business primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. However, the Company has performed work outside of that area in the past. Backlog. The Company has a backlog (anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of awarded projects) of orders totaling approximately $110,200,000 as of December 31, 2006, compared to approximately $82,200,000 as of December 31, 2005, and approximately $36,000,000 at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that approximately $40,000,000 of the December 31, 2006 backlog is not reasonably expected to be completed in the next fiscal year. The Company is actively seeking new contracts to add to its backlog. Management believes that its value engineering services will continue to assist the Company in obtaining new contracts. A portion of the Companys anticipated revenue in any year is not reflected in its backlog at the start of the year because some projects are awarded and performed in the same year. The Company believes that its backlog is firm, notwithstanding provisions contained in the contracts which allow customers to modify or cancel the contracts at any time, subject to certain conditions, including reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with the contracts and the possible payment of cancellation fees. Competition. The mechanical contracting market is highly competitive. There are many larger regional and national companies with resources greater than those of the Company. However, some of these large competitors are unfamiliar with the New York City metropolitan area. The Company believes it competes favorably with such companies because of its reputation in the New York City area and its knowledge of the local labor force and its ability to value engineer projects. There are also many smaller contractors and subcontractors in the New York City metropolitan area, who may also compete for work. The Company believes there are barriers to entry for smaller competitors, including bonding requirements, relationships with subcontractors, suppliers and union workers. 5 Regulations. The construction industry is subject to various governmental regulations from local, state and federal authorities, such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and environmental agencies. The Company is also governed by state and federal requirements regarding the handling and disposal of lead paint, but the impact cannot be predicted at this time because it varies from project to project. The Company must also comply with regulations as to the use and disposal of solvents and hazardous wastes, compliance with which are a normal part of its operations. The Company does not perform asbestos abatement, but has occasionally subcontracted that part of a contract to duly licensed asbestos abatement companies with the Company being named as an additional insured on the asbestos abatement companys liability insurance policy. The Company has not incurred any liability for violations of environmental laws. Employees. At December 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 45 full time office and project support employees. The Company also employs field employees, who are union workers. The number of field union workers employed varies at any given time, depending on the number and types of ongoing projects and the scope of projects under contract. The Company hires union labor for specific work assignments and can reduce the number of union workers hired at will with no penalties. The Company pays benefits to union employees through payments to trust funds established by the unions. The Companys obligation is to pay a percentage of the wages of union workers to these trust funds. Thus, the Company does not accrue liabilities for pension and medical benefits to union retirees. The Company provides its full time office employees, not subject to collective bargaining agreements, with medical insurance benefits and a discretionary matching 401(k) plan. In 2006, the Company matched 25% of its employees yearly 401(k) contributions. Dependence Upon Customers. At any given time, a material portion of the Companys contract revenue may be generated from a single customer through one large contract or various contracts. The Companys customer base can vary each year based on the nature and scope of the projects undertaken in that year. For the year ended December 31, 2006, work under contracts with Bovis Lend Lease LMB, Inc., Newmark Construction Services, LLC, Glenwood Management Corporation and related entities, and Skanska USA Building Inc. constituted 40%, 18%, 10% and 10% of the Companys total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, work under contracts with Bovis Lend Lease LMB, Inc., Newmark Construction Services, LLC and related entities, Skanska USA Building Inc., M.D. Carlisle Construction Corp., and Plaza Construction Corp. constituted 31%, 11%, 11%, 11% and 10% of the Companys total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, work under contracts with Bovis Lend Lease LMB, Inc., Newmark Construction Services, LLC and related entities, and Glenwood Management Corporation, constituted 32%, 23% and 16% of the Companys total revenues, respectively. 6 Historically, a portion of the Companys revenue has been generated from contracts with federal, state and local governmental authorities. The Companys current revenue and backlog does not include any contracts directly with these governmental authorities. As is customary and required in the industry, the Company is often requested to provide a surety bond. The Companys ability to obtain bonding, and the amount of bonding required, is solely at the discretion of the surety and is primarily based upon the Companys net worth, working capital, the number and size of projects under construction and the suretys relationship with management. The larger the project and or the number of projects under contract, the greater the requirements are for bonding, net worth and working capital. The Company generally pays a fee to the bonding company of an amount approximately 1% of the amount of the contract to be performed. Since inception, the Company has neither been denied any request for payment or performance bonds, nor has a bonding company been required to make a payment on any bonds issued for the Company. At December 31, 2006, approximately $39,000,000 of the Companys backlog was bonded. Other Matters. The Company does not own any patents, patent rights or similar intellectual property. The Companys business is not subject to large seasonal variations. The Company did not expend funds for research and development during 2006, 2005 and 2004, and anticipates no research and development expenses in 2007. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below as well as adverse business conditions. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties, not known or described below, which have not been determined to be material may also impair the Companys business operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all other information in this report, including information contained in the "Business", "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" sections. If any of the following risks occur, the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Such events may cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results, and the trading price of the Companys stock could decline. For these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements. The Company has a written employment agreement with Floyd Warkol, its Chairman and CEO, which expires on December 31, 2009. The Company has no other current employment or non competition agreements with senior management. The failure to retain senior management would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. The Companys continued ability to obtain bonding is critical to its ability to bid on most public work and on certain private projects. The suretys provision of bonding pursuant to its arrangement with the Company is solely at the suretys discretion, and the arrangement with the surety is an at will arrangement subject to termination. If the Company is unable to obtain surety bonds as needed, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 7 The Company has in the past experienced erosion in gross profit margins due to lower than anticipated labor productivity and higher labor costs related to shortages of skilled labor and unforeseen jobsite conditions. There can be no assurance that these factors will not affect productivity in the future. The Company has in the past experienced significant increases in the cost of steel piping materials, which is the primary material used by the Company on projects. Future increases may impact the Companys profit margins beyond the Companys estimates. An economic downturn could result in a decrease in construction spending in the private and public sectors, which could reduce the Companys revenues. The Company relies on a relatively small number of customers for a significant share of its revenues. The loss of business from any of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and its operating results. The Company faces intense competition due to the highly competitive nature of the mechanical contracting market that could limit its ability to increase its market share and its revenues. During the construction period, owners or general contractors may require the Company to perform certain work which is a change to or in addition to the original contract. Such work often requires months to obtain formal change orders (including dollar amounts). Change orders are often the subject of dispute and sometimes litigation. The failure of an owner or general contractor to issue change orders or make payments could delay receipt of revenue and require litigation to collect sums due the Company. Slow receipt of collections may also result from financial difficulties of a general contractor or an owner. The Companys inability to collect its contract balance on a project could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Although the Companys operations are not directly affected by inflation, both New York City and New York State have large debt service burdens. Inflationary pressures have tended to result in a reduction in capital spending by both state and local agencies; such capital expenditure reductions in turn could have a negative impact on the Companys revenues. Failure of the Companys subcontractors or providers of equipment to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on the Companys results. The Company subcontracts a portion of its contracts to specialty subcontractors, and the Company is ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. The Company also utilizes equipment manufacturers and suppliers which are responsible for delivering specified products on a timely basis. Although the Company utilizes highly respected companies and sometime requires performance bonds, there is no guarantee that the Company will not incur a material loss due to performance issues related to these arrangements. Accounting for contract related revenues and costs as well as other cost items requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Although the Company believes it has sufficient experience and processes to enable it to formulate appropriate 8 assumptions and produce reliable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future, and these changes could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Companys success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment. The single largest factor in the Companys ability to profitably execute its work is its ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. The Companys success in attracting qualified personnel is dependent on the resources available, the impact of general economic conditions on the labor supply, and the ability to provide competitive compensation. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable. ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Pursuant to a Modification of Lease Agreement, dated as of May 1, 1998, the Company leases office and warehouse space in Long Island City, New York, consisting of 18,433 square feet. The lease had an initial annual base rent of $173,000, with yearly rent increases of approximately 2%. The lease is a triple net lease and thus the Company will pay any increases on real estate taxes over base year taxes, maintenance, insurance and utilities. The Company has exercised a three year option extending the lease through June 2009. The Company also occupies a building and a storage yard in Bronx, New York, consisting of a 14,000 square foot building, including 4,000 square feet of offices and 10,000 square feet of shop space. It also occupies an adjacent 5,000 square foot storage yard. This property is jointly owned by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and a charitable foundation he controls. This tenancy is on a triple net basis. The Company pays rent of approximately $8,500 per month, plus taxes (currently approximately $2,000 per month), maintenance, insurance and utilities. The written lease for this property expired on December 31, 2002 and the property is currently being occupied on a month to month basis. The properties are well maintained, adequate and suitable for their purposes. ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There is no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party. ITEM 4.

The Company restated these previously reported amounts and, with the oversight of its Audit Committee, corrected its financial reporting system. Gross profit for the year did not change due to the offsetting effects of the misstatements. (b) During the year ended December 31, 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses include stock compensation expenses of approximately $693 related to the exercise of stock options and the adoption, as of January 1, 2006, of accounting standard SFAS 123 R. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling $200, which reduced selling, general and administrative expenses. 12 (c) During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance totaling $1,045 against its deferred tax assets, at the recommendation of the Companys outside auditors engaged in the preparation of the 2002 audit. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the outstanding deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed, after the Companys management re evaluated the likelihood that these assets could be used in their entirety, and concluded the valuation allowance was not required. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write off of goodwill as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, which accounted for $1,888 of the net loss. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis explains the general financial condition and the results of operations for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 including: o factors that affect our business; o our earnings and costs in the periods presented; o changes in earnings and costs between periods; o sources of earnings; and o impacts of these factors on our overall financial condition. As you read this discussion and analysis, please refer to the Companys consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 included in this report. OVERVIEW The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, furnishes and installs HVAC systems and process piping systems for institutional, industrial, commercial, high rise residential and public works projects. The Company does not actively pursue projects under $3,000,000. Some larger company projects involve multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of the Companys revenue in any given year. The Company also serves as a mechanical trade manager, performing project management services relating to the mechanical trades. The Company obtains projects through both competitive and negotiated bidding processes submitted to project owners or construction managers, many with whom the Company has long standing commercial relationships. The Company is awarded many of its contracts by providing value engineering assistance, whereby the Company recommends changes to project plans, subject to the approval of the design professional. This assistance reduces costs and yields the same results as the original designs. As a result, during 2006, the Company obtained many of its contracts without bidding against its competitors. The Companys profitability is dependent on its ability to continue to maintain its commercial relationships and provide quality services necessary to obtain projects. The Companys costs of revenues include field labor, equipment, material, subcontractor and 13 overhead costs. Overhead costs include project supervision and drafting salaries, as well as insurance costs. The Company must control costs of revenues by having the ability to manage material costs, purchase equipment at or below original estimated amounts and control labor costs throughout the duration of each project. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Companys earnings were affected by (1) increased volume (2) expenses related to the vesting and exercising of stock options, (3) an increase in corporate income tax expense and (4) the reversal of the allowance for doubtful accounts. (1) The Companys revenues for 2006 increased 44.5%, as a result of the Companys performance on its backlog as of December 31, 2005, as well as contracts received during 2006. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase in office overhead will be needed during 2007 to complete the December 31, 2006 backlog of $110,200,000. (2) On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 R, "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123 R"). SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the awards fair value at the date of grant. The Company elected to adopt SFAS 123 R on the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method of transition under SFAS 123 R, compensation costs in 2006 include costs for options granted prior to, but not vested as of December 31, 2005, and options vested in 2006. Therefore, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), and related interpretations. The Company did not record compensation expense because the exercise price of the shares was equal to the market price at the date of the grant. SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure", requires proforma net income disclosures as if the fair value based method defined in SFAS 123 has been applied. The Company continued to apply the provisions of APB 25 and provided the proforma disclosures required by SFAS 123 and amended by SFAS 148. The adoption of SFAS 123 R lowered net income by approximately $29,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition during 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase 287,832 shares, which lowered net income by approximately $345,000. (3) The corporate income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was higher due to increased earnings. (4) During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts, which increased net income by approximately $107,000. The majority of the Companys contracts are awarded on a fixed price basis. Subcontractor and equipment purchases are awarded on a fixed price basis, near the time the Companys contract is awarded. The Company purchases most materials throughout the project on a price in effect basis. The Company includes allowances in its estimates for future 14 escalations in steel prices. On May 4, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with a supplier of piping materials, whereby the Company has committed to purchase certain piping products normally used in its operations, as well as fabrication services, at set prices through April 30, 2007. This agreement does not cover all types of materials the Company utilizes on its projects. The Company has not been able to obtain fixed pricing on certain materials, such as copper tubing, due to current pricing volatility. The Company does not believe that pricing increases on items not covered by this purchase agreement will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Companys earnings increased as a result of (1) increased volume with primarily the same overhead structure as in the prior year, (2) the settlement of the Co Op City litigation, and (3) the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. (1) Even though the Companys revenues increased 103.1%, during 2005, the Company was not required to materially increase office overhead to support this increase in revenues. (2) On October 17, 2005, KSW Mechanical Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Stipulation of Settlement settling a lawsuit commenced in 1999, entitled KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. v. NAB Construction Corp. et. al. ("the Lawsuit"), which had been pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Queens. KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. sued the general contractor and its bonding company on the Co Op City Project to recover its accounts receivable applicable to the base contract of approximately $437,000, unpaid final retainage billings of approximately $1,500,000, plus a claim for unanticipated costs incurred through 1998 in the sum, as presented at trial, of $2,303,727. The Defendant asserted counterclaims, as presented at trial, totaling $1,440,905, and a claim for $3,000,000 based on the argument that KSW Mechanicals mechanics lien was willfully overstated. The Lawsuit was tried for 47 days and further trial proceedings were scheduled. Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, all claims and counterclaims were discontinued, and the Company received cash payments totaling $2,900,000, with $1,200,000 paid as of December 15, 2005, $850,000 paid by March 31, 2006, and $850,000 paid by September 30, 2006. During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a pretax net gain, after settlement expenses, of approximately $888,000, related to this matter. (3) During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets establishing, as of January 1, 2002, a test whereby the fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. Based upon this test, the goodwill of the Company was written off during the first quarter of 2002. This write off of goodwill created an increase in the deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company provided a valuation allowance (or reserve) against its net deferred tax assets based upon the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization (or use) in their entirety of these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding deferred tax asset valuation was $1,220,000. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company generated profits which reduced this deferred tax valuation allowance and the Company reversed the outstanding deferred tax valuation allowance. This allowance 15 was reversed after the Companys management re evaluated the likelihood that those assets could be used in their entirety and concluded that the valuation allowance was not required. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company took steps to further control its office cost management. These steps included reduction in office staff, as well as the Companys Chief Executive Officer reducing his salary by 20%, with a proportionate reduction in his work week. During the latter half of 2005, the Companys Chief Executive Officer resumed a five day work week and also negotiated a new employment agreement. Management believes that the future success of the Company lies in its ability to obtain new projects, maintain proper cost controls related to this work, pursue new trade management contracts and continue controlling office expenditures. The Company is dependant on outside factors such as the general health of the New York City metropolitan area economy and continued low interest rates, both of which relate to the strength of the building industry and the type of projects the Company has the ability to obtain. Increasing governmental deficits could also affect the amount of new governmental financed projects which the Company could pursue. The Company must also continue to obtain surety bonds, when required on projects. The Companys management has experience in expanding into new geographic areas; however, to date the Company has conducted its operations primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the amounts of and as a percentage of total revenues, certain items of the Companys statement of operations for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Revenues ........................... $ 77,128 100.0 $ 53,378 100.0 $ 26,281 100.0 Costs of revenues .................. 67,155 87.1 46,897 87.9 24,139 91.8 Gross profit ....................... 9,973 12.9 6,481 12.1 2,142 8.2 Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ...... 5,147 6.7 3,657 6.8 3,452 13.1 Operating income (loss) ............ 4,826 6.2 2,824 5.3 (1,310) (4.9) Other income ....................... 361 .5 39 .1 52 .1 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes ...................... 5,187 6.7 2,863 5.4 (1,258) (4.8) Provision for income taxes ......... 2,422 3.1 152 .3 22 .1 Net income (loss) .................. $ 2,765 3.6 $ 2,711 5.1 $ (1,280) (4.9) 16 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 Revenues Revenues increased $23,750,000, or 44.5%, to $77,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $53,378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $19,591,000, an increase of $2,490,000, or 14.6%, as compared to $17,101,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2006, the Company had backlog of approximately $110,200,000. Approximately $40,000,000 of the December 31, 2006 backlog is not reasonably expected to be completed in the next fiscal year. The Company is actively seeking new projects to add to its backlog. These increases in revenues were a result of the Companys performance on its backlog of work as of December 31, 2005, as well as work obtained during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company earned 40%, 18%, 10% and 10% of revenues, respectively, from its largest customers. The Company bids on large multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of its contract revenue in any given year. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues increased by $20,258,000, or 43.2%, to $67,155,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $46,897,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Costs of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $16,666,000, an increase of $2,259,000 as compared to $14,407,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005. Costs of revenues include subcontractor costs, field labor, material, equipment and overhead expenses. Overhead costs include project supervision and drafting salaries as well as insurance costs. The increase in costs of revenues corresponded to the increase in revenues for the applicable periods. Since higher revenues generally require higher expenditures of costs, the increased revenues allowed the Company to allocate the cost of project supervision and drafting salaries over multiple projects and more effectively utilize its experienced field labor personnel. In addition, the Company took steps to reduce pricing volatility of piping materials by entering into agreements to purchase these products at fixed prices. Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had a gross profit of $9,973,000 or 12.9% of revenues, as compared to $6,481,000 or 12.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the gross profit was $2,925,000 or 14.9% of revenues, as compared to $2,694,000 or 15.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase dollar amount in gross profits was primarily a result of the overall increase in revenues. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the gross profit included an $888,000 gain on the settlement of the Co Op City project claim settlement. 17 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2006, selling, general and administrative ("S,G&A") expenses increased $1,490,000, or 40.7%, to $5,147,000, as compared to $3,657,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, S,G&A expenses were $1,146,000, an increase of $320,000, as compared to $826,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the above yearly and quarterly periods, a portion of these changes were a result of the vesting and exercising of stock options, professional fees and employment costs. During the year ended December 31, 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase 287,832 shares, which increased S,G&A expenses by approximately $640,000. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred expenses related to the vesting of stock options of approximately $53,000. Professional fees, related to the Companys public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, together with American Stock Exchange fees increased approximately $130,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling $200,000, which reduce S,G&A expenses. The remaining changes in S,G&A expenses were primarily a result of increases in employment costs and office expenses. During the latter half of 2005, the Companys Chief Executive Officer returned to a five day work week, and additional office staff was hired, contributing to the increases in 2006. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $322,000 or 825.6%, to $361,000, as compared to other income of $39,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. This change in other income was primarily a result of the Companys ability to earn interest income on its increased cash position. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $317,000, as compared to $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company realized gains on the sales of marketable securities totaling $44,000 and $15,000, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2,422,000, or 46.7% of income before taxes compared to $152,000, or 5.3% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the provision for income taxes differs from the Companys effective income tax rate primarily due to the reversal of a deferred income tax valuation allowance. 18 Net income As a result of all the items above, the Company reported net income of $2,765,000, or $.49 per share basic and $.48 per share diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in net income for the year December 31, 2006, are net expenses of approximately $374,000 related to exercising and vesting of stock options during the period, which resulted in a reduction in the calculation of earnings per share of approximately $.07 per share basic and diluted. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts, which increased net income by approximately $107,000 or $.02 per share basic and diluted. Excluding the effect of stock options and the reversal of the allowance for doubtful accounts, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been approximately $3,032,000, or $.54 per share basic and $.53 per share diluted. The Company reported net income of $2,711,000 or $.50 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of the one time adjustments for the Co Op City litigation and the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance, net income for 2005 would have been $1,473,000 or $.27 per share basic and diluted. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 Revenues Revenues from the Companys projects increased $27,097,000, or 103.1%, to $53,378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $26,281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase in revenues was primarily a result of the Companys increased number of contracts in progress at December 31, 2004, as well as projects the Company obtained during 2005. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $17,101,000, an increase of $10,224,000, as compared to $6,877,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. The revenues in the fourth quarter of 2005 include approximately $963,000 related to the Companys settlement of the Co Op City litigation. At December 31, 2005, the Company had backlog of approximately $82,200,000. The backlog at December 31, 2005 did not include a $9,000,000 contract, which commencement is subject to the projects owner obtaining financing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company earned 31%, 11%, 11%, 11% and 10% of revenues, respectively, from its largest customers. The Company bids on large multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of its contract revenue in any given year. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues increased by $ 22,758,000, or 94.3%, to $46,897,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $24,139,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Costs of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $ 14,407,000, an increase of $8,068,000, as compared to $6,339,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. The increases in costs of revenues correspond to the increase in revenue noted above. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company incurred expenses related to the Co Op City litigation settlement of approximately $75,000. 19 During year ended December 31, 2004, costs of revenues were increased by the following factors which were not present in 2005: increased costs of steel piping products, revenues insufficient to absorb job costed project supervision and drafting salaries, and increased labor costs incurred by the Company to retain experienced field labor personnel. These factors did not have the same impact in 2005, and management does not expect these conditions to have the same impact in the future. The Company reduced pricing volatility on purchases of steel piping material by entering into an agreement to purchase these products at fixed prices. In addition, increased revenues and backlog have allowed the Company to allocate the cost of project supervision and drafting salaries over multiple projects and to more effectively utilize its experienced field labor personnel. Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had a gross profit of $6,481,000, or 12.1% of revenues, as compared to $2,142,000, or 8.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the gross profit was $2,694,000, or 15.8% of revenues, as compared to $538,000, or 7.8% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2004. The increased dollar amount in gross profits was primarily a result of the overall increase in revenues. In addition, during the 2005 fourth quarter, the gross profit included an $888,000 gain on the settlement of the Co Op City project claim litigation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative ("S,G&A") expenses increased $205,000, or 5.9%, to $3,657,000 compared to $3,452,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter 2005, S,G&A expenses were $826,000 as compared to $566,000 for the same period in 2004, an increase of $260,000. For the above yearly and quarterly periods, the Companys increase in S,G&A was primarily a result of the administration of increased revenues, including an increase in employment costs and office expenses. These increased costs include the Companys Chief Executive Officer resuming a five day work week, and the hiring of additional office staff. In addition, professional fees related to the Companys public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as an increase in utility costs related to its office contributed to this increase. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $13,000, or (25.0%), to $39,000, as compared to $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company realized gains on sales of marketable securities totaling $15,000 and $48,000, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company earned net interest income of $24,000 and $4,000, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $152,000, or 5.3% of income before taxes compared to income tax expense of $22,000, or 1.7% of the loss before income taxes in 2004. 20 The provision for income taxes differs from the Companys effective income tax rate primarily due to a reversal of a deferred income tax valuation allowance. During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets establishing, as of January 1, 2002, a test whereby the fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. Based upon this test, the goodwill of the Company was written off during the first quarter of 2002. This write off of goodwill created an increase in the deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company provided a valuation allowance (or reserve) against its net deferred tax assets based upon the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization (or use) in their entirety of these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $1,220,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company generated profits which reduced this deferred tax valuation allowance by $461,000. Based upon the Companys backlog as of September 30, 2005, management re evaluated the likelihood that these assets could be used in their entirety, and concluded that the valuation allowance was not required. At September 30, 2005, the Company reversed the outstanding deferred tax valuation allowance totaling approximately $759,000. State and local tax rates are not affected by the above, but are determined by the Companys net worth. Net Income As a result of all the items above, the Company reported net income of $2,711,000 or $.50 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to a reported net loss of $1,280,000 or $(.24) per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of the one time adjustments for the Co Op City litigation settlement and the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance, net income for 2005 would have been $1,473,000 or $.27 per share basic and diluted. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General The Companys principal capital requirement is to fund its work on construction projects. Projects are billed on a monthly basis based on the work performed to date. These project billings, less a withholding of retention which is received as the project nears completion, are collectible based on the respective contract terms. The Company has historically relied primarily on internally generated funds. The Company has not relied on bank borrowings to finance its operations since July 2003. The Company has a line of credit, which is subject to certain conditions. See discussion of Credit Facility below. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balances totaled $14,085,000, an increase of $8,886,000 from the $5,199,000 reported as of December 31, 2005. 21 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $8,485,000 and $2,325,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $168,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The cash provided by operations in both 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to increases in operating income. During 2004, the cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of losses incurred during the period that were partially offset by receivables collected in excess of cash payments made. Cash provided by operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 include receipts on the Co Op City litigation settlement of $1,700,000 in 2006 and $1,200,000 in 2005. Cash used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities were $51,000 in 2006, $86,000 in 2005 and $28,000 in 2004. The Company purchased marketable securities of $12,000, $163,000 and $685,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company received proceeds on the sales of marketable securities of $171,000, $153,000 and $676,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, the Company purchased property and equipment totaling $210,000, $76,000 and $19,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by Financing Activities During 2006, net cash provided by financing activities was $452,000. During 2005 and 2004, no cash was provided by or used in financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 287,832 shares contributing cash proceeds of $475,000 to the Company. Prior to adopting SFAS 123 R, the Company presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123 R requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax asset for such options. As a result of adopting SFAS 123 R, $318,000 of excess tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006 have been classified as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow. On May 8, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $.06 per share to shareholders of record as of May 24, 2006. The aggregate amount of the dividend was $341,000, and this dividend was paid on June 15, 2006. Credit Facility The Company has a line of credit facility from Bank of America, N.A., which provides borrowings for working capital purposes up to $2,000,000. This facility is secured by the Companys assets and is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiary, KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. On March 8, 2007, the Companys bank extended the working capital credit facility for a 22 term expiring March 30, 2008. There have been no borrowings against this facility during 2006 and 2005. Advances bear interest, based on the Companys option, at either the banks prime lending rate plus one percent per annum (9.25% at December 31, 2006), or the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus two and one half percent per annum (7.84% at December 31, 2006). Payment may be accelerated by certain events of default such as unfavorable credit factors, the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Companys business, properties or financial condition, a default in payment on the line, impairment of security, bankruptcy, or the Company ceasing operations or being unable to pay its debts. The line of credit must be paid in full at the end of the term. The Company currently has no significant capital expenditure commitments. Surety On some of its projects, the Company is required to provide a surety bond. The Companys ability to obtain bonding, and the amount of bonding available, is solely at the discretion of the surety and is primarily based upon the Companys net worth, working capital, the number and size of projects under construction and the suretys relationship with management. The Company is contingently liable to the surety under a general indemnity agreement. The Company agrees to indemnify the surety for any payments made on contracts of suretyship, guaranty or indemnity as a result of the Company not having the financial capacity to complete projects. Management believes the likelihood of the surety having to complete projects is remote. The contingent liability is the cost of completing all bonded projects, which is an undeterminable amount because it is subject to bidding by third parties. Management believes that all contingent liabilities will be satisfied by the Companys performance on the specific bonded contracts involved. The surety provides bonding solely at its discretion, and the arrangement with the surety is an at will arrangement subject to termination. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $39,000,000 of the Companys backlog of approximately $110,200,000 was bonded. The Company provides its surety with a detailed schedule of backlog on a quarterly basis. The Companys bonding limits are sufficient given the volume and size of the Companys bonded contracts. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 23 The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. The Company believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. Accounting for revenue recognition for construction contracts The Company recognizes revenue for long term construction contracts not yet completed using the "percentage of completion" method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date as compared to total estimated costs at the completion of each contract. When the Company bids on projects, a comprehensive budget is prepared dividing the project into line items indicating separate labor, equipment, material, subcontractor and overhead cost estimates. As projects progress, the Companys project managers plan, schedule and oversee operations and review project costs compared to the estimates. Management reviews on a bi weekly basis the progression of the contract with the project manager. An analysis is prepared and reviewed monthly by management comparing the costs incurred to the budgeted amounts. The results of these procedures help determine the anticipated total costs at completion, based on facts and circumstances known at the time. Any revisions in cost and profit estimates are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts, which require the revisions, become known. These estimates are subject to revisions due to unanticipated increases in labor, material and equipment costs as well as project scope changes. The Company receives change orders for project scope changes. For some project cost overruns, the Company can make a claim to the project owner or general contractor to seek reimbursement of these overruns. In the past, the Company has been successful in the pursuit of such claims. Such claims are not carried on the books until they are acknowledged by the owner or contractor. Accounts and retainage receivable Judgment is required to estimate the collectibility of accounts and retainage receivable. The Company has in the past established an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts and retainage receivable based upon historical collection experience and managements periodic evaluation of the collectibility of outstanding accounts and retainage receivable on an account by account basis. Accounts receivable and contract retentions are due based on contract terms. Amounts are deemed delinquent when they are not received within their contract terms. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer. 24 At December 31, 2006, the Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts and retainage receivable. Accounting for income taxes Judgment is required in developing the Companys provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Companys consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 include deferred tax assets totaling $505,000 and $1,349,000, respectively. Accounting for stock based compensation The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 R. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term"), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements ("forfeitures"). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value stock based compensation and the related amount recognized in the consolidated income statements. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company in 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 25 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued beginning with the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial conditions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of December 31, 2006, outstanding contractual obligations are as follows: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL LESS THAN 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS AFTER 5 YEARS Long term debt $ $ $ $ $ Capital leases Operating leases (a) 494,000 195,000 299,000 Purchase obligations under construction contracts (b) Other long term obligations Total $ 494,000 $ 195,000 $ 299,000 $ $ (a) The Company is obligated to pay monthly rental payments of approximately $16,000 on its lease for office space in Long Island City, New York. The Company has exercised its option to extend the lease for the period July 2006 through June 2009. (b) On May 4, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with a supplier of piping materials, whereby the Company has committed to purchase certain piping products normally used in its operations, as well as fabrication services, at set prices through April 30, 2007. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS No disclosures are required pursuant to Item 303 (a) (4) of Regulation S K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company does not utilize futures, options or other derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has invested $663,000 in marketable securities. 26

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis explains the general financial condition and the results of operations for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 including: o factors that affect our business; o our earnings and costs in the periods presented; o changes in earnings and costs between periods; o sources of earnings; and o impacts of these factors on our overall financial condition. As you read this discussion and analysis, please refer to the Companys consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 included in this report. OVERVIEW The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, furnishes and installs HVAC systems and process piping systems for institutional, industrial, commercial, high rise residential and public works projects. The Company does not actively pursue projects under $3,000,000. Some larger company projects involve multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of the Companys revenue in any given year. The Company also serves as a mechanical trade manager, performing project management services relating to the mechanical trades. The Company obtains projects through both competitive and negotiated bidding processes submitted to project owners or construction managers, many with whom the Company has long standing commercial relationships. The Company is awarded many of its contracts by providing value engineering assistance, whereby the Company recommends changes to project plans, subject to the approval of the design professional. This assistance reduces costs and yields the same results as the original designs. As a result, during 2006, the Company obtained many of its contracts without bidding against its competitors. The Companys profitability is dependent on its ability to continue to maintain its commercial relationships and provide quality services necessary to obtain projects. The Companys costs of revenues include field labor, equipment, material, subcontractor and 13 overhead costs. Overhead costs include project supervision and drafting salaries, as well as insurance costs. The Company must control costs of revenues by having the ability to manage material costs, purchase equipment at or below original estimated amounts and control labor costs throughout the duration of each project. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Companys earnings were affected by (1) increased volume (2) expenses related to the vesting and exercising of stock options, (3) an increase in corporate income tax expense and (4) the reversal of the allowance for doubtful accounts. (1) The Companys revenues for 2006 increased 44.5%, as a result of the Companys performance on its backlog as of December 31, 2005, as well as contracts received during 2006. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase in office overhead will be needed during 2007 to complete the December 31, 2006 backlog of $110,200,000. (2) On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 R, "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123 R"). SFAS 123 R requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the awards fair value at the date of grant. The Company elected to adopt SFAS 123 R on the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method of transition under SFAS 123 R, compensation costs in 2006 include costs for options granted prior to, but not vested as of December 31, 2005, and options vested in 2006. Therefore, results for prior periods have not been restated. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), and related interpretations. The Company did not record compensation expense because the exercise price of the shares was equal to the market price at the date of the grant. SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure", requires proforma net income disclosures as if the fair value based method defined in SFAS 123 has been applied. The Company continued to apply the provisions of APB 25 and provided the proforma disclosures required by SFAS 123 and amended by SFAS 148. The adoption of SFAS 123 R lowered net income by approximately $29,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition during 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase 287,832 shares, which lowered net income by approximately $345,000. (3) The corporate income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was higher due to increased earnings. (4) During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts, which increased net income by approximately $107,000. The majority of the Companys contracts are awarded on a fixed price basis. Subcontractor and equipment purchases are awarded on a fixed price basis, near the time the Companys contract is awarded. The Company purchases most materials throughout the project on a price in effect basis. The Company includes allowances in its estimates for future 14 escalations in steel prices. On May 4, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with a supplier of piping materials, whereby the Company has committed to purchase certain piping products normally used in its operations, as well as fabrication services, at set prices through April 30, 2007. This agreement does not cover all types of materials the Company utilizes on its projects. The Company has not been able to obtain fixed pricing on certain materials, such as copper tubing, due to current pricing volatility. The Company does not believe that pricing increases on items not covered by this purchase agreement will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Companys earnings increased as a result of (1) increased volume with primarily the same overhead structure as in the prior year, (2) the settlement of the Co Op City litigation, and (3) the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. (1) Even though the Companys revenues increased 103.1%, during 2005, the Company was not required to materially increase office overhead to support this increase in revenues. (2) On October 17, 2005, KSW Mechanical Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Stipulation of Settlement settling a lawsuit commenced in 1999, entitled KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. v. NAB Construction Corp. et. al. ("the Lawsuit"), which had been pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Queens. KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. sued the general contractor and its bonding company on the Co Op City Project to recover its accounts receivable applicable to the base contract of approximately $437,000, unpaid final retainage billings of approximately $1,500,000, plus a claim for unanticipated costs incurred through 1998 in the sum, as presented at trial, of $2,303,727. The Defendant asserted counterclaims, as presented at trial, totaling $1,440,905, and a claim for $3,000,000 based on the argument that KSW Mechanicals mechanics lien was willfully overstated. The Lawsuit was tried for 47 days and further trial proceedings were scheduled. Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, all claims and counterclaims were discontinued, and the Company received cash payments totaling $2,900,000, with $1,200,000 paid as of December 15, 2005, $850,000 paid by March 31, 2006, and $850,000 paid by September 30, 2006. During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a pretax net gain, after settlement expenses, of approximately $888,000, related to this matter. (3) During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets establishing, as of January 1, 2002, a test whereby the fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. Based upon this test, the goodwill of the Company was written off during the first quarter of 2002. This write off of goodwill created an increase in the deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company provided a valuation allowance (or reserve) against its net deferred tax assets based upon the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization (or use) in their entirety of these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding deferred tax asset valuation was $1,220,000. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company generated profits which reduced this deferred tax valuation allowance and the Company reversed the outstanding deferred tax valuation allowance. This allowance 15 was reversed after the Companys management re evaluated the likelihood that those assets could be used in their entirety and concluded that the valuation allowance was not required. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company took steps to further control its office cost management. These steps included reduction in office staff, as well as the Companys Chief Executive Officer reducing his salary by 20%, with a proportionate reduction in his work week. During the latter half of 2005, the Companys Chief Executive Officer resumed a five day work week and also negotiated a new employment agreement. Management believes that the future success of the Company lies in its ability to obtain new projects, maintain proper cost controls related to this work, pursue new trade management contracts and continue controlling office expenditures. The Company is dependant on outside factors such as the general health of the New York City metropolitan area economy and continued low interest rates, both of which relate to the strength of the building industry and the type of projects the Company has the ability to obtain. Increasing governmental deficits could also affect the amount of new governmental financed projects which the Company could pursue. The Company must also continue to obtain surety bonds, when required on projects. The Companys management has experience in expanding into new geographic areas; however, to date the Company has conducted its operations primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the amounts of and as a percentage of total revenues, certain items of the Companys statement of operations for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Revenues ........................... $ 77,128 100.0 $ 53,378 100.0 $ 26,281 100.0 Costs of revenues .................. 67,155 87.1 46,897 87.9 24,139 91.8 Gross profit ....................... 9,973 12.9 6,481 12.1 2,142 8.2 Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses ...... 5,147 6.7 3,657 6.8 3,452 13.1 Operating income (loss) ............ 4,826 6.2 2,824 5.3 (1,310) (4.9) Other income ....................... 361 .5 39 .1 52 .1 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes ...................... 5,187 6.7 2,863 5.4 (1,258) (4.8) Provision for income taxes ......... 2,422 3.1 152 .3 22 .1 Net income (loss) .................. $ 2,765 3.6 $ 2,711 5.1 $ (1,280) (4.9) 16 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 Revenues Revenues increased $23,750,000, or 44.5%, to $77,128,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $53,378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $19,591,000, an increase of $2,490,000, or 14.6%, as compared to $17,101,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2006, the Company had backlog of approximately $110,200,000. Approximately $40,000,000 of the December 31, 2006 backlog is not reasonably expected to be completed in the next fiscal year. The Company is actively seeking new projects to add to its backlog. These increases in revenues were a result of the Companys performance on its backlog of work as of December 31, 2005, as well as work obtained during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company earned 40%, 18%, 10% and 10% of revenues, respectively, from its largest customers. The Company bids on large multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of its contract revenue in any given year. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues increased by $20,258,000, or 43.2%, to $67,155,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $46,897,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Costs of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $16,666,000, an increase of $2,259,000 as compared to $14,407,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005. Costs of revenues include subcontractor costs, field labor, material, equipment and overhead expenses. Overhead costs include project supervision and drafting salaries as well as insurance costs. The increase in costs of revenues corresponded to the increase in revenues for the applicable periods. Since higher revenues generally require higher expenditures of costs, the increased revenues allowed the Company to allocate the cost of project supervision and drafting salaries over multiple projects and more effectively utilize its experienced field labor personnel. In addition, the Company took steps to reduce pricing volatility of piping materials by entering into agreements to purchase these products at fixed prices. Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had a gross profit of $9,973,000 or 12.9% of revenues, as compared to $6,481,000 or 12.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the gross profit was $2,925,000 or 14.9% of revenues, as compared to $2,694,000 or 15.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase dollar amount in gross profits was primarily a result of the overall increase in revenues. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the gross profit included an $888,000 gain on the settlement of the Co Op City project claim settlement. 17 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2006, selling, general and administrative ("S,G&A") expenses increased $1,490,000, or 40.7%, to $5,147,000, as compared to $3,657,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, S,G&A expenses were $1,146,000, an increase of $320,000, as compared to $826,000 for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the above yearly and quarterly periods, a portion of these changes were a result of the vesting and exercising of stock options, professional fees and employment costs. During the year ended December 31, 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase 287,832 shares, which increased S,G&A expenses by approximately $640,000. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company incurred expenses related to the vesting of stock options of approximately $53,000. Professional fees, related to the Companys public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, together with American Stock Exchange fees increased approximately $130,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling $200,000, which reduce S,G&A expenses. The remaining changes in S,G&A expenses were primarily a result of increases in employment costs and office expenses. During the latter half of 2005, the Companys Chief Executive Officer returned to a five day work week, and additional office staff was hired, contributing to the increases in 2006. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $322,000 or 825.6%, to $361,000, as compared to other income of $39,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. This change in other income was primarily a result of the Companys ability to earn interest income on its increased cash position. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $317,000, as compared to $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company realized gains on the sales of marketable securities totaling $44,000 and $15,000, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2,422,000, or 46.7% of income before taxes compared to $152,000, or 5.3% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the provision for income taxes differs from the Companys effective income tax rate primarily due to the reversal of a deferred income tax valuation allowance. 18 Net income As a result of all the items above, the Company reported net income of $2,765,000, or $.49 per share basic and $.48 per share diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in net income for the year December 31, 2006, are net expenses of approximately $374,000 related to exercising and vesting of stock options during the period, which resulted in a reduction in the calculation of earnings per share of approximately $.07 per share basic and diluted. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed the allowance for doubtful accounts, which increased net income by approximately $107,000 or $.02 per share basic and diluted. Excluding the effect of stock options and the reversal of the allowance for doubtful accounts, net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been approximately $3,032,000, or $.54 per share basic and $.53 per share diluted. The Company reported net income of $2,711,000 or $.50 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of the one time adjustments for the Co Op City litigation and the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance, net income for 2005 would have been $1,473,000 or $.27 per share basic and diluted. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 Revenues Revenues from the Companys projects increased $27,097,000, or 103.1%, to $53,378,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $26,281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase in revenues was primarily a result of the Companys increased number of contracts in progress at December 31, 2004, as well as projects the Company obtained during 2005. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $17,101,000, an increase of $10,224,000, as compared to $6,877,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. The revenues in the fourth quarter of 2005 include approximately $963,000 related to the Companys settlement of the Co Op City litigation. At December 31, 2005, the Company had backlog of approximately $82,200,000. The backlog at December 31, 2005 did not include a $9,000,000 contract, which commencement is subject to the projects owner obtaining financing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company earned 31%, 11%, 11%, 11% and 10% of revenues, respectively, from its largest customers. The Company bids on large multi year contracts, which can account for more than 10% of its contract revenue in any given year. Costs of Revenues Costs of revenues increased by $ 22,758,000, or 94.3%, to $46,897,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $24,139,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Costs of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $ 14,407,000, an increase of $8,068,000, as compared to $6,339,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004. The increases in costs of revenues correspond to the increase in revenue noted above. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company incurred expenses related to the Co Op City litigation settlement of approximately $75,000. 19 During year ended December 31, 2004, costs of revenues were increased by the following factors which were not present in 2005: increased costs of steel piping products, revenues insufficient to absorb job costed project supervision and drafting salaries, and increased labor costs incurred by the Company to retain experienced field labor personnel. These factors did not have the same impact in 2005, and management does not expect these conditions to have the same impact in the future. The Company reduced pricing volatility on purchases of steel piping material by entering into an agreement to purchase these products at fixed prices. In addition, increased revenues and backlog have allowed the Company to allocate the cost of project supervision and drafting salaries over multiple projects and to more effectively utilize its experienced field labor personnel. Gross Profit For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had a gross profit of $6,481,000, or 12.1% of revenues, as compared to $2,142,000, or 8.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the gross profit was $2,694,000, or 15.8% of revenues, as compared to $538,000, or 7.8% of revenues, for the fourth quarter of 2004. The increased dollar amount in gross profits was primarily a result of the overall increase in revenues. In addition, during the 2005 fourth quarter, the gross profit included an $888,000 gain on the settlement of the Co Op City project claim litigation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative ("S,G&A") expenses increased $205,000, or 5.9%, to $3,657,000 compared to $3,452,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the fourth quarter 2005, S,G&A expenses were $826,000 as compared to $566,000 for the same period in 2004, an increase of $260,000. For the above yearly and quarterly periods, the Companys increase in S,G&A was primarily a result of the administration of increased revenues, including an increase in employment costs and office expenses. These increased costs include the Companys Chief Executive Officer resuming a five day work week, and the hiring of additional office staff. In addition, professional fees related to the Companys public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as an increase in utility costs related to its office contributed to this increase. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $13,000, or (25.0%), to $39,000, as compared to $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company realized gains on sales of marketable securities totaling $15,000 and $48,000, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company earned net interest income of $24,000 and $4,000, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $152,000, or 5.3% of income before taxes compared to income tax expense of $22,000, or 1.7% of the loss before income taxes in 2004. 20 The provision for income taxes differs from the Companys effective income tax rate primarily due to a reversal of a deferred income tax valuation allowance. During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets establishing, as of January 1, 2002, a test whereby the fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. Based upon this test, the goodwill of the Company was written off during the first quarter of 2002. This write off of goodwill created an increase in the deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company provided a valuation allowance (or reserve) against its net deferred tax assets based upon the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization (or use) in their entirety of these deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $1,220,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company generated profits which reduced this deferred tax valuation allowance by $461,000. Based upon the Companys backlog as of September 30, 2005, management re evaluated the likelihood that these assets could be used in their entirety, and concluded that the valuation allowance was not required. At September 30, 2005, the Company reversed the outstanding deferred tax valuation allowance totaling approximately $759,000. State and local tax rates are not affected by the above, but are determined by the Companys net worth. Net Income As a result of all the items above, the Company reported net income of $2,711,000 or $.50 per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to a reported net loss of $1,280,000 or $(.24) per share basic and diluted for the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of the one time adjustments for the Co Op City litigation settlement and the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance, net income for 2005 would have been $1,473,000 or $.27 per share basic and diluted. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES General The Companys principal capital requirement is to fund its work on construction projects. Projects are billed on a monthly basis based on the work performed to date. These project billings, less a withholding of retention which is received as the project nears completion, are collectible based on the respective contract terms. The Company has historically relied primarily on internally generated funds. The Company has not relied on bank borrowings to finance its operations since July 2003. The Company has a line of credit, which is subject to certain conditions. See discussion of Credit Facility below. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balances totaled $14,085,000, an increase of $8,886,000 from the $5,199,000 reported as of December 31, 2005. 21 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $8,485,000 and $2,325,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was $168,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The cash provided by operations in both 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to increases in operating income. During 2004, the cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of losses incurred during the period that were partially offset by receivables collected in excess of cash payments made. Cash provided by operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 include receipts on the Co Op City litigation settlement of $1,700,000 in 2006 and $1,200,000 in 2005. Cash used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities were $51,000 in 2006, $86,000 in 2005 and $28,000 in 2004. The Company purchased marketable securities of $12,000, $163,000 and $685,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company received proceeds on the sales of marketable securities of $171,000, $153,000 and $676,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, the Company purchased property and equipment totaling $210,000, $76,000 and $19,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by Financing Activities During 2006, net cash provided by financing activities was $452,000. During 2005 and 2004, no cash was provided by or used in financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2006, six individuals exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 287,832 shares contributing cash proceeds of $475,000 to the Company. Prior to adopting SFAS 123 R, the Company presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123 R requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits represent tax benefits related to exercised options in excess of the associated deferred tax asset for such options. As a result of adopting SFAS 123 R, $318,000 of excess tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2006 have been classified as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow. On May 8, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $.06 per share to shareholders of record as of May 24, 2006. The aggregate amount of the dividend was $341,000, and this dividend was paid on June 15, 2006. Credit Facility The Company has a line of credit facility from Bank of America, N.A., which provides borrowings for working capital purposes up to $2,000,000. This facility is secured by the Companys assets and is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiary, KSW Mechanical Services, Inc. On March 8, 2007, the Companys bank extended the working capital credit facility for a 22 term expiring March 30, 2008. There have been no borrowings against this facility during 2006 and 2005. Advances bear interest, based on the Companys option, at either the banks prime lending rate plus one percent per annum (9.25% at December 31, 2006), or the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus two and one half percent per annum (7.84% at December 31, 2006). Payment may be accelerated by certain events of default such as unfavorable credit factors, the occurrence of a material adverse change in the Companys business, properties or financial condition, a default in payment on the line, impairment of security, bankruptcy, or the Company ceasing operations or being unable to pay its debts. The line of credit must be paid in full at the end of the term. The Company currently has no significant capital expenditure commitments. Surety On some of its projects, the Company is required to provide a surety bond. The Companys ability to obtain bonding, and the amount of bonding available, is solely at the discretion of the surety and is primarily based upon the Companys net worth, working capital, the number and size of projects under construction and the suretys relationship with management. The Company is contingently liable to the surety under a general indemnity agreement. The Company agrees to indemnify the surety for any payments made on contracts of suretyship, guaranty or indemnity as a result of the Company not having the financial capacity to complete projects. Management believes the likelihood of the surety having to complete projects is remote. The contingent liability is the cost of completing all bonded projects, which is an undeterminable amount because it is subject to bidding by third parties. Management believes that all contingent liabilities will be satisfied by the Companys performance on the specific bonded contracts involved. The surety provides bonding solely at its discretion, and the arrangement with the surety is an at will arrangement subject to termination. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $39,000,000 of the Companys backlog of approximately $110,200,000 was bonded. The Company provides its surety with a detailed schedule of backlog on a quarterly basis. The Companys bonding limits are sufficient given the volume and size of the Companys bonded contracts. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 23 The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. The Company believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates. Accounting for revenue recognition for construction contracts The Company recognizes revenue for long term construction contracts not yet completed using the "percentage of completion" method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date as compared to total estimated costs at the completion of each contract. When the Company bids on projects, a comprehensive budget is prepared dividing the project into line items indicating separate labor, equipment, material, subcontractor and overhead cost estimates. As projects progress, the Companys project managers plan, schedule and oversee operations and review project costs compared to the estimates. Management reviews on a bi weekly basis the progression of the contract with the project manager. An analysis is prepared and reviewed monthly by management comparing the costs incurred to the budgeted amounts. The results of these procedures help determine the anticipated total costs at completion, based on facts and circumstances known at the time. Any revisions in cost and profit estimates are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts, which require the revisions, become known. These estimates are subject to revisions due to unanticipated increases in labor, material and equipment costs as well as project scope changes. The Company receives change orders for project scope changes. For some project cost overruns, the Company can make a claim to the project owner or general contractor to seek reimbursement of these overruns. In the past, the Company has been successful in the pursuit of such claims. Such claims are not carried on the books until they are acknowledged by the owner or contractor. Accounts and retainage receivable Judgment is required to estimate the collectibility of accounts and retainage receivable. The Company has in the past established an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts and retainage receivable based upon historical collection experience and managements periodic evaluation of the collectibility of outstanding accounts and retainage receivable on an account by account basis. Accounts receivable and contract retentions are due based on contract terms. Amounts are deemed delinquent when they are not received within their contract terms. Delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer. 24 At December 31, 2006, the Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts and retainage receivable. Accounting for income taxes Judgment is required in developing the Companys provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Companys consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 include deferred tax assets totaling $505,000 and $1,349,000, respectively. Accounting for stock based compensation The Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 R. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term"), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements ("forfeitures"). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value stock based compensation and the related amount recognized in the consolidated income statements. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by the Company in 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 25 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued beginning with the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial conditions.
