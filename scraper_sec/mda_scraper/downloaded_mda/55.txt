ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Part 1, Items 1A, Risk Factors, of this report. OVERVIEW Synovis Life Technologies, Inc., a diversified medical device company, develops, manufactures and markets biological and mechanical products used by several surgical specialties to facilitate the repair and reconstruction of soft tissue damaged or destroyed by disease or injury. Our products include implantable biomaterials for soft tissue repair, devices for microsurgery, and surgical tools all designed to reduce risks and or facilitate critical surgeries, improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. SIGNIFICANT RECENT DEVELOPMENT On December 12, 2011, Synovis, Baxter International Inc., a Delaware corporation (Baxter), and Twins Merger Sub, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Baxter will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Synovis for $28.00 per share in cash, without interest, and pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter (the Merger). The Merger is expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2012, subject to the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of shares of Synovis Common Stock as well as satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to closing specified in the Merger Agreement. 21 OPERATING RESULTS FISCAL 2011 ($ in thousands except per share data) Net revenue increased 20% during fiscal 2011 to $82,363 from $68,565 in fiscal 2010. Our operating income was $12,362 in fiscal 2011, compared to $7,335 in the prior year. Net income for fiscal 2011 was $8,461, or 73 cents per diluted share, compared to $4,876, or 43 cents per diluted share during fiscal 2010. The following table summarizes our net revenue by product group and geography for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010: Net Revenue: 2011 2010 ($ in thousands) $ % $ % Peri Strips $ 23,675 29 % $ 19,414 28 % Tissue Guard 18,407 22 % 16,550 24 % Veritas 15,829 19 % 14,368 21 % Microsurgery 15,190 19 % 11,020 16 % Surgical Tools and other 5,748 7 % 5,335 8 % Orthopedic and Wound 3,514 4 % 1,878 3 % Total Net Revenue $ 82,363 100 % $ 68,565 100 % Domestic $ 70,130 85 % $ 57,700 84 % International 12,233 15 % 10,865 16 % Worldwide $ 82,363 100 % $ 68,565 100 % The increase in net revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to that of fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the following: Incremental worldwide units sold, inclusive of new product introductions, increased revenue approximately $8,500; and Higher average net selling prices primarily due to various worldwide hospital list price increases for certain of our products increased revenue by approximately $5,300. In the United States, each of our business units has its own distinct sales channel. As of October 31, 2011, we have 60 direct sales representatives selling our surgical business products, having just completed an expansion of four territories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and we presently expect to add four additional direct sales representatives in fiscal 2012. We have 12 direct sales representatives selling our microsurgery products, and presently expect to add several direct sales representatives in fiscal 2012. For our Ortho & Wound products, we have an independent sales force consisting of 32 independent representative groups (each with multiple sales representatives) as of October 31, 2011 and we intend to appoint additional independent sales groups during fiscal 2012. Internationally, all of our products are sold through independent third party stocking distributors. The increase in worldwide units sold in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to higher Peri Strips revenue believed to be primarily due to increased procedure volumes of sleeve gastrectomies, increased volumes of Tissue Guard units sold worldwide, increased market penetration of our microsurgery products and increased Ortho & Wound volumes due primarily to the establishment and development of our independent sales force. We cannot fully assess the impact economic conditions may have had on our results of operations during fiscal 2011. We believe, however, that the volume of certain surgical procedures in which our products are used, particularly those which may be considered elective, has been impacted by economic conditions. In addition, we believe that the financial condition of various hospital customers has been impacted by the economic conditions. These notable items, as well as other factors, may have had an impact on our results of operations. 22 Worldwide net revenue from Peri Strips was $23,675 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $4,261 or 22% as compared to revenue of $19,414 in fiscal 2010. Increased volume of units sold during fiscal 2011 drove the revenue increase, which we believe was primarily driven by an increased number of sleeve gastrectomy procedures, which are more likely to use a buttress compared to other bariatric surgeries and typically use more buttresses per procedure. Higher average net selling prices in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 also contributed to the increase. Peri Strips are used to reduce risks and improve patient outcomes in bariatric and thoracic procedures using surgical staples. Revenue from Peri Strips used with Ethicon surgical staplers increased 37% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, while revenue from Peri Strips used with Covidien staplers decreased 5%. Covidien launched a competitive buttress product in mid fiscal 2009 supplied integral with their stapler cartridges, which has adversely impacted Peri Strips revenue. In fiscal 2011, approximately 80% of our worldwide Peri Strips revenue was derived from buttresses used with Ethicon staplers, as compared to 73% in fiscal 2010. Revenue from Tissue Guard patch products was $18,407 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $1,857 or 11% from $16,550 in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 increase was driven by a 6% increase in units sold worldwide, in addition to higher average selling prices in the current year. Our Tissue Guard family of products is used to repair and replace damaged tissue in an array of surgical procedures, including cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and neurologic procedures. Revenue from Veritas patch products was $15,829 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $1,461 or 10% from $14,368 in fiscal 2010. The increase in Veritas revenue was driven by higher average net selling prices in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Veritas is an extremely strong and conformable biomaterial which acts as a scaffold that enables rapid repopulation and revascularization by the surrounding host tissue. Revenue from Microsurgery was $15,190 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $4,170 or 38% from $11,020 in fiscal 2010. The revenue growth in fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by increased market acceptance of the Coupler and the Flow Coupler, and higher average net selling prices for our Coupler products, which cumulatively resulted in a 44% growth in Coupler products during fiscal 2011. The Coupler is a device used to connect extremely small arteries or veins, without sutures, quickly, easily and with consistently excellent results. The Flow Coupler enhances our Microsurgery product offerings by combining our existing Coupler with Doppler technology, enabling physicians to verify and monitor blood flow. Revenue from Ortho & Wound products was $3,514 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $1,636 or 87% as compared to $1,878 in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we transitioned from a hybrid sales force to a fully independent sales force. As they have gained experience with our Ortho & Wound products, our independent representatives have become increasingly effective at communicating the clinical benefits of our products to physicians. The OrthADAPT Bioimplant is used in numerous orthopedic applications, including rotator cuff and Achilles tendon repair, where there is a clinical need to reinforce the repair. Unite Biomatrix provides a durable, collagen structure that need be applied only once to a wound and maintains its integrity while promoting wound healing. Our gross margin increased by six tenths of a percentage point to 72.9% in fiscal 2011 from 72.3% during fiscal 2010. On a consolidated basis, higher average net selling prices in fiscal 2011 positively impacted gross margin partially offset by product mix. Our Ortho & Wound gross margin increased 13 percentage points to 54% in fiscal 2011 primarily due to a higher percentage of sales in the current year representing lower cost manufactured inventory as compared to higher cost acquired units in the prior year. Our surgical business gross margin increased one percentage point to 77% in fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher average net selling prices for our products. Our microsurgical business gross margin increased one percentage point to 60% in fiscal 2011 due to higher average net selling prices for certain of our products. Factors which may affect the gross margin include product and geographic mix of products sold, volume, product acquisitions and disposals, and other production activities. Accordingly, our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on variations in these factors. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense during fiscal 2011 was $42,949, an increase of $5,137 or 14% from SG&A expense of $37,812 in fiscal 2010. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expense was 52% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 55% in the prior year. The fiscal 2011 SG&A increase was primarily due to approximately $4,072 in higher sales and marketing costs across each of our businesses driven by increased personnel, increased compensation associated with higher revenue levels, and increased marketing activities to drive current and long term revenue growth. 23 In fiscal 2012, we expect to incur higher SG&A expense as compared to fiscal 2011 due to incremental investments we believe are necessary to drive near and long term revenue growth. Such investments include increased sales staff at both our surgical and microsurgical businesses, increased sales and marketing costs to promote our products and increased clinical study activities. Research and development (R&D) expense totaled $4,709 during fiscal 2011, an increase of $316 or 7% from $4,393 in fiscal 2010, driven by increased project activity and related increased personnel costs in support of higher project activities near and long term. Fiscal 2011 R&D activity focused on several activities, including research to expand the size offerings and indications for use of our Veritas product into new and existing markets, providing research and clinical data to support the use of Veritas in various surgical procedures, exploring additional process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary biomaterial products, advancing the size offerings and technology of the Flow Coupler and providing research and clinical data to support the launch of the ProCuff product, an arthroscopically delivered augmentation device for tendon repair, including rotator cuff repair. In fiscal 2012, we expect R&D expense to increase compared to fiscal 2011 due to several activities, including research to expand the size offerings and indications for use of our Veritas product into new and existing markets, providing research and clinical data to support the use of Veritas in various surgical procedures, exploring additional process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary biomaterial products, advancing the size offerings and technology of the Flow Coupler and providing research and clinical data to support the launch of the ProCuff product, an arthroscopically delivered augmentation device for tendon repair, including rotator cuff repair. We recorded operating income of $12,362 in fiscal 2011, an increase of $5,027 as compared to operating income of $7,335 in fiscal 2010. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher revenue levels in the current year. Interest income was $311 in fiscal 2011 compared with $284 in fiscal 2010. We recorded a provision for income taxes in fiscal 2011 of $4,212, at an effective tax rate of 33.2%. This was less than our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate of 36.0%, primarily due to recording $350 of discrete income tax benefit in fiscal 2011, related to reinstatement of the Federal R&D credit from fiscal 2010, as well as from exercises of employee incentive stock options. In fiscal 2010, we recorded income tax expense of $2,743 at an effective rate of 36.0%. As of October 31, 2011, we recorded $447 in net current deferred income tax assets and $2,166 in net long term deferred income tax assets. OPERATING RESULTS FISCAL 2010 ($ in thousands except per share data) Net revenue increased 18% during fiscal 2010 to $68,565 from $58,211 in fiscal 2009. Our operating income was $7,335 in fiscal 2010, compared to $4,002 in the prior fiscal year. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 was $4,876, or 43 cents per diluted share, compared to $2,706, or 23 cents per diluted share during fiscal 2009. The following table summarizes our net revenue by product group and geography for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009: Net Revenue: 2010 2009 ($ in thousands) $ % $ % Peri Strips $ 19,414 28 % $ 19,384 33 % Tissue Guard 16,550 24 % 15,806 27 % Veritas 14,368 21 % 8,757 15 % Microsurgery 11,020 16 % 8,668 15 % Surgical Tools and other 5,335 8 % 5,531 10 % Orthopedic and Wound 1,878 3 % 65 0 % Total Net Revenue $ 68,565 100 % $ 58,211 100 % Domestic $ 57,700 84 % $ 49,290 85 % International 10,865 16 % 8,921 15 % Worldwide $ 68,565 100 % $ 58,211 100 % 24 The increase in net revenue in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the following: Incremental worldwide units sold increased revenue approximately $6,300; Ortho & Wound products increased revenue approximately $1,800; and Higher average net selling prices primarily due to various worldwide hospital list price increases for certain of our products increased revenue by approximately $2,250. The increase in worldwide units sold was primarily attributable to the expansion of our direct sales force in the second half of fiscal 2009, increased market acceptance of Veritas into the worldwide hernia and general surgery markets and increased market penetration of our microsurgery products. We believe the expansion of our domestic direct sales force is a key element of our long term strategy to increase revenues. In fiscal 2009, we expanded our sales force by 22 sales representatives for a total of 65 sales representatives at the end of fiscal 2009. As of October 31, 2010, we had a total of 73 sales representatives in the U.S: 56 sales representatives sell our Veritas, Peri Strips, Tissue Guard and Surgical tools and other products, nine sales representatives sell our Microsurgery products and eight sales representatives sell our Ortho & Wound products. We cannot fully assess the impact the economic downturn may have had on our results of operations during fiscal 2010. We believe, however, that the volume of certain surgical procedures in which our products are used, particularly those which may be considered elective, has been impacted by the current economic downturn. In addition, we believe that the financial condition of various hospital customers has been negatively impacted by the economic downturn. These notable items, as well as other factors, may have had an impact on our results of operations. Worldwide net revenue from Peri Strips was $19,414 in fiscal 2010, essentially flat as compared to revenue of $19,384 in fiscal 2009. Increased average net selling prices were offset by slightly lower units sold in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 Peri Strips revenue was also affected by the impact of increased competition within the buttressing market. Covidien, one of the two primary companies which offer surgical staplers on which our Peri Strips products are used, launched a buttress product in mid fiscal 2009 supplied integral with their stapler cartridges. During fiscal 2010, worldwide revenue from Peri Strips products which are used with Covidien staplers decreased 30% from fiscal 2009. This was offset by fiscal 2010 revenue for Peri Strips products used with Ethicon staplers increasing 20% from fiscal 2009. Revenue from Tissue Guard patch products was $16,550 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $744 or 5% from $15,806 in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 increase was driven by a 3% increase in units sold worldwide, in addition to slightly higher average selling prices in the current year. Revenue from Veritas patch products was $14,368 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $5,611 or 64% from $8,757 in fiscal 2009. Veritas revenue growth in fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by incremental worldwide sales into the plastic and reconstructive and general surgery markets. Additionally, late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we received CE Mark approval for the use of Veritas in soft tissue repair and commenced selling Veritas to our European distributors. Higher average net selling prices also contributed to the revenue increase in fiscal 2010. Revenue from Microsurgery was $11,020 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $2,352 or 27% from $8,668 in fiscal 2009. The revenue growth was primarily driven by the fiscal 2009 expansion of our sales force, increased market acceptance of the Coupler, as well as the domestic market launch of the Flow Coupler in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, resulting in a 24% increase in Coupler unit sales in fiscal 2010. Revenue from Ortho & Wound products was $1,878 in fiscal 2010 as compared to $65 from July to October 2009. Our U.S. sales coverage has increased from approximately 10% at the beginning of fiscal 2010 to approximately 75% at the end of fiscal 2010, and our Ortho & Wound sales force continues to develop their sales territories and customer base by establishing relationships with pre acquisition customers as well as prospecting for new customers. Our gross margin increased by one half of a percentage point to 72.3% in fiscal 2010 from 71.8% during fiscal 2009. On a consolidated basis, higher average list selling prices for certain of our products in fiscal 2010 were partially offset by product mix and lower manufacturing utilization in the current year. Our surgical business gross margin increased two percentage points to 76% in fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher average net selling prices for our products and higher sales of Veritas, which has a higher gross margin relative to other surgical business products. These were offset by lower manufacturing efficiencies in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Our microsurgical business gross margin decreased one percentage point to 59% in fiscal 2010 due to product mix and higher inventory costs. Our Ortho & Wound gross margin was 41% in fiscal 2010, as substantially all of our sales were of inventory acquired in our July 2009 acquisition, which had higher stepped up cost basis due to purchase accounting rules. 25 SG&A expense during fiscal 2010 was $37,812, an increase of $7,945 or 27% from SG&A expense of $29,867 in fiscal 2009. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expense was 55% in fiscal 2010 as compared to 51% in the prior year. The SG&A expense increase was due to $3,766 of incremental costs related to our Ortho & Wound business, which we acquired in July 2009, as well as approximately $3,500 of incremental expense related to the expansion of our direct sales force in the second half of fiscal 2009. Additionally, stock based compensation expense was $1,455 (9 cents per diluted share) in fiscal 2010, up from $937 (7 cents per diluted share) in fiscal 2009. R&D expense totaled $4,393 during fiscal 2010, an increase of $595 or 16% from $3,798 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 activity focused on several activities, including research to potentially expand the indications of our Veritas product into new markets, providing research and clinical data to support the use of Veritas in various surgical procedures, exploring process improvements and product enhancements for our proprietary tissue products, comparative studies involving Peri Strips and its competition, advancing the technology of the Coupler and further development of an orthopedic product and related instrumentation. In fiscal 2009, we recorded other operating expenses of $4,100. We expensed acquired in process R&D costs of $3,500 related to our acquisition of the assets of Pegasus, as it was determined the related projects had no alternative future use. We also recorded an impairment charge of $600 related to identifiable intangible assets related to our fiscal 2007 acquisition of the 4Closure Surgical Fascia Closure System (4Closure) following an impairment analysis. This analysis was performed as a result of a delay in the fiscal 2009 re launch and re brand of the product, combined with actual revenues since acquisition not meeting projected expectations. No other operating expenses were recorded in fiscal 2010. We recorded operating income of $7,335 in fiscal 2010, an increase of $3,333 as compared to operating income of $4,002 in fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income in fiscal 2010 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by a reduction of other operating costs of $4,100 (zero of these costs were incurred in fiscal 2010 while $4,100 were incurred in fiscal 2009). In addition, the operating loss related to our Ortho & Wound business was approximately $4,100 higher in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 given a full year of operations in fiscal 2010, with this higher operating loss largely offset by higher operating profitability in our other operations. Interest income was $284 in fiscal 2010 compared with $920 in fiscal 2009, primarily due to significantly lower investment yields and lower investment balances in the current year. Additionally in fiscal 2009, we sold our auction rate securities (ARS), which had a par value of $9,000, for $7,650, realizing a loss on sale of $1,350. We recorded a provision for income taxes in fiscal 2010 of $2,743 at an effective tax rate of 36.0%. We recorded income tax expense of $866 in fiscal 2009 at an effective rate of 24.2% of pretax income. Our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate was comprised of a tax rate of 27.3% on operations and interest income and a 35.3% tax benefit on the capital loss of $1,350 incurred upon the sale of our ARS. Our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate on operations and interest income was lower than fiscal 2010 due to lower pretax income in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2010, higher permanent differences that reduce taxes and a lower overall rate for state taxes. As of October 31, 2010, we recorded $367 in net current deferred income tax assets and $2,139 in net long term deferred income tax assets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ($ in thousands) Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $66,551 as of October 31, 2011, an increase of $4,627 as compared to cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $61,924 as of October 31, 2010. Included in the balance above, we have $7,335 of investments classified as non current as of October 31, 2011. Working capital at October 31, 2011 and 2010 was $72,881 and $66,271, respectively. We have no long term debt. We currently expect our cash on hand and cash from operations to be sufficient to cover both our short and long term operating requirements, subject however, to numerous variables, including acquisition opportunities, research and development priorities, and the growth and profitability of the business. 26 The increase in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $11,377 in fiscal 2011. This was partially offset by the use of $7,580 to repurchase 450,122 shares of our common stock in fiscal 2011. Operating activities provided cash of $11,377 in fiscal 2011, as compared to providing cash of $6,903 during fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of $8,461 and $4,028 in non cash expenses. Working capital changes used cash of $1,112 in fiscal 2011, driven by $2,811 of cash used for increased accounts receivable and $565 of cash used for increased inventories to support higher revenue levels, which were offset by $2,522 of cash provided by increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable. The fiscal 2010 cash provided by operating activities was driven by net income of $4,876 and $5,074 in non cash expenses. Working capital changes used cash of $3,047 in fiscal 2010, driven by $1,980 of cash used for increased accounts receivable and $1,709 of cash used for increased inventories to support higher revenue levels. Investing activities used cash of $3,136 during fiscal 2011. We used cash of $888 towards the net purchase of short and long term investments during the year. We also used $1,932 for purchases of property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2011. Investing activities used cash of $7,006 during fiscal 2010, as we used $5,779 towards the net purchase of short and long term investments, and $1,102 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. Financing activities used cash of $3,179 during fiscal 2011, as compared to $2,809 in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, $7,580 of cash was used to repurchase 450,122 shares of common stock, partially offset by $3,879 of proceeds from equity based compensation plans. During fiscal 2010, $5,101 of cash was used to repurchase 385,836 shares of common stock, partially offset by $1,996 of proceeds from equity based compensation plans. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and operating leases. For more information, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our commitments under these obligations are as follows as of October 31, 2011: &lt; 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 &lt; years Total Operating leases $ 1,027 $ 1,007 $ 23 $ $ 2,057 INFLATION We believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Substantially all of our foreign transactions are negotiated, invoiced, and paid in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries may therefore influence the demand for our products by changing the price of our products as denominated in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Investments: Our investments consist of taxable and tax exempt commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds, and municipal bond investments. Our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goal of preserving principal, maintaining adequate liquidity at all times, and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines. We account for all of our investments as available for sale and report these investments at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of shareholders equity. We review our investments for impairment to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary. A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity. Such unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other than temporary. Accounts Receivable: Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition, historical sales, and payment history. Generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, our previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligation to us, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. We write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 27 Indefinite lived Intangible Assets: Our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of goodwill, which is carried at cost. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are required to be reviewed annually for impairment, and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform an annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often as circumstances require. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, estimates of market capitalization and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. Recoverability is assessed by comparison of the fair value of the Company to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the Company is less than its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Definite lived Intangible Assets: Definite lived intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks, developed technology, non competes, and licenses, which are carried at amortized cost. We review our definite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by reference to future cash flows from the products underlying these intangible assets. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when the product has been shipped to the customer if there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the products, delivery, and performance have occurred, the price and terms of sale are fixed and collection of the receivable is expected. Less than five percent of our revenue is derived from consigned inventory, for which we recognize revenue upon customer use and receipt of proper purchase order and or purchase requisition documentation.All amounts billed to customers in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue. Our sales policy does not allow sales returns. Inventories: Inventories, which are comprised of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods, are valued at the lower of cost, first in, first out (FIFO) or market. Overhead costs are applied to work in process and finished goods based on annual estimates of production volumes and overhead spending. These estimates are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed. The estimated value of excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value, is established on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future product demand, anticipated release of new products into the market, historical experience, and product expiration. Stock Based Compensation: We recognize stock based compensation based on certain assumptions within the Black Scholes Model. These assumptions are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment. Because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. We assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination. Income Taxes: We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes (temporary differences). Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 28 ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We maintain financial instruments in cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. We believe that the interest rate, credit, and market risk related to these accounts is not significant. We manage the risk associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value for non collectability of assets and establishment of appropriate allowances in connection with our internal controls and policies. We may enter into derivative instruments or perform hedging activities. However, our policy is to only enter into contracts that can be designated as normal purchases or sales. 29
