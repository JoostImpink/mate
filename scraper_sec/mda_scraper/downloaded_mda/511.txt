Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of the following MD&A is to help facilitate an understanding of the significant factors influencing our historical operating results, financial condition and cash flows and also to convey managements expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may materially impact future results. This MD&A contains forward looking statements as described on page i of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward looking statements contained in the following MD&A exclude the potential effects of the proposed CVS Merger unless otherwise expressly stated. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview We are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the United States. Our services assist employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner. Our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management, or PBM, services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety, effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use. We generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs, either directly through our mail service pharmacies or indirectly through our network of third party retail pharmacies, and through providing certain other services, including health management, health benefits management and data access to our customers, which are primarily employers, unions, government employee groups, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the United States. Our net revenue represents amounts earned from both our customers and the participants in our customers health benefit plans and includes copayments paid by participants both to us, for prescriptions filled from pharmacies we own, and to the third party pharmacies in our retail network, for most retail prescriptions. Our net revenues reflect the effects of any discounts provided to our customers. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition, to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for detailed information concerning our revenue recognition policies. We generate cost savings for our customers primarily by negotiating for the discounted purchase of pharmaceutical products dispensed to their participants. We purchase pharmaceutical products from, and negotiate various forms of discounts from established benchmark prices with, pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies. When we purchase pharmaceutical products directly from their manufacturer, as is typically the case with generic and biotech products, we generally receive any negotiated discount at the time of purchase. When we purchase pharmaceutical products indirectly (e.g., through 35 Index to Financial Statements a wholesaler or from a retail pharmacy at the point of dispensing), as is typically the case with brand name, nonbiotech products, we generally receive a discount from the vendor and, in many cases, the products manufacturer. In these cases, the vendor discount is received at the time of purchase; however, the manufacturer discount is received after the product is dispensed. Our cost of revenues reflects the effects of these discounts. The prices we have negotiated with our customers for the pharmaceutical products we dispense to their participants are generally based on contractual discounts from established benchmark prices and may also include additional discounts based on the type (i.e., preferred brand, non preferred brand, generic, etc.) of prescriptions filled. Most of our customer contracts utilize an average wholesale price (AWP) benchmark to establish pricing. The prices in our vendor contracts with various parties (manufacturers, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, etc.) for the purchase of these pharmaceuticals are also based on discounts from established benchmark prices plus, in many cases, additional discounts in the form of prompt payment terms and or rebates. Recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors, pharmacy providers, PBMs and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize AWP as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Specifically, in a proposed settlement in a civil class action case brought against First DataBank (FDB), one of several companies that report data on prescription drug prices, and McKesson Corporation, FDB has agreed to reduce the reported AWP of certain drugs by four percent and to discontinue the publishing of AWP at a future time as contemplated by the settlement. At this time, the proposed settlement has not received final court approval. The court could approve the proposed settlement in part, in its entirety, or not at all. We cannot predict the outcome of this case, or, if the settlement is approved, the precise timing of any of the proposed AWP changes or the effect of such changes, if any, on the financial performance of the Company. Over 90% of our customer relationships and most of our relationships with other affected parties contain terms that we believe will enable us to mitigate the adverse effect of this proposed reduction in FDBs reported AWP. Two other publicly traded large national PBMs have also stated that their contractual relationships contain similar terms. However, because in some cases payors may seek to negotiate with PBMs in an effort to reduce prescription drug costs as a result of a reduction in FBDs reported AWP, the ultimate effect of this development on us cannot be precisely predicted. Whatever the outcome of the FDB case, it is possible that payors, pharmacy providers and PBMs will begin to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and pharmacy benefit management services in the future. Additionally, both our customer and vendor contracts typically contain clauses which would allow us to renegotiate pricing in the event that legislation or other events limiting or eliminating the various discounting practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including the practice of providing discounts in the form of rebates, were to occur. We generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs on behalf of our customers. We dispense these prescriptions drugs through our seven large, automated mail service pharmacies, our 21 smaller, regional specialty mail service pharmacies and a nationwide network composed of over 60,000 retail pharmacies with which we have contracted to purchase pharmaceuticals on behalf of our customers for immediate delivery to their participants. One customer, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenue in 2006. On November 1, 2006, we announced our intent to merge with CVS. See Item 1, Business Proposed Merger with CVS for further information concerning this proposed Merger. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes. We previously had a significant deferred tax asset related to federal and state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that were primarily generated from losses incurred in our discontinued PPM business. The significant majority of these NOLs were utilized to offset taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2005 and prior years. Due to the complexity of our discontinued operations divestiture and the fact 36 Index to Financial Statements that the tax periods in which the NOLs were generated can be audited well beyond a normal three year statutory audit period, the amount of the NOLs which may ultimately be realized may vary materially from the amount utilized to offset taxable income. We have established an accrual for tax related contingencies primarily related to issues which may arise from the tax periods when the NOLs were generated. This accrual is based on our estimates of the amount of benefit from the NOLs that we may ultimately be unable to realize. Subsequent revisions to the accrual for tax related contingencies may cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period. Estimates Concerning Contingencies. Generally accepted accounting principles specify the criteria for disclosing contingent losses and recording any related estimate of the loss amount. These criteria are based on both probability assessments of the eventual outcome of the contingent event and on the availability of information necessary to estimate the amount of the loss. If it is determined that: (i) it is probable a material loss has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated, the nature of the loss should be disclosed, and an estimate of the loss should be recorded. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss has been incurred, the nature of the possible loss should be disclosed along with an estimate of the amount of the loss if it is available. To the extent that the incurrence of a material loss is judged remote, no disclosure is required. The most significant contingencies to which we are exposed, other than the tax related contingencies discussed above, relate to damages sought by claimants under various lawsuits and investigations. The specific cases for which we believe it may be at least reasonably possible that we have incurred a loss are discussed further at Item 3, Legal Proceedings and in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Probability estimates related to the anticipated outcomes of lawsuits/investigations and to the amounts of damages which may ultimately be awarded are inherently uncertain. We have made our estimates based on all available facts and circumstances existing as of the date such estimates were made. Although these estimates have been made based on our prior experience with litigation/investigations, our knowledge of the details of each case, and, in many cases, our consultation with external legal counsel, the actual outcome of pending litigation and investigations could differ materially from our estimates. Accounts Receivable Valuation Allowances. We are exposed to credit losses from accounts receivable that are recorded as assets in our financial statements but may ultimately be uncollectible and to adjustments to accounts receivable based on contractual interpretations and customer audits. We perform detailed analyses of accounts receivable and related data on a monthly basis and have attempted to allow for expected adjustments based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable. We believe our accounts receivable valuation allowances to be adequate; however, it is possible that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time. We continually review and refine our estimation processes to make them as reactive to these changes as possible; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate the amounts of these accounts receivable that will ultimately be collected. Medicare Part D. We have recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from our participation as a PDP in the federal governments Medicare Part D program based on information in our claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from our participation in the Medicare Part D program include: (i) estimates of low income cost subsidy and reinsurance amounts ultimately payable to or receivable from CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in 2007; (ii) estimates of amounts payable to or receivable from other PDPs, state Medicaid programs or individuals for claims costs incurred during the startup phase of the program where widespread retroactive enrollment changes were communicated by CMS after such claims had been incurred; and (iii) an estimate of amounts payable to CMS under a risk sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor. Actual amounts of Medicare Part D related assets and liabilities could differ materially from amounts recorded. 37 Index to Financial Statements The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Factors That May Affect Future Results Our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably, which is, in turn, heavily dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate discounts for pharmaceutical purchases at various points in our supply chain and to successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth. Our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors, including, but not limited to: (i) identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities; (ii) our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers; (iii) declining reimbursement levels for, or increases in the costs of, products dispensed, including, but not limited to, the effect of changes in industry benchmarks used to determine pricing of products; (iv) exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance; (v) compliance with, or changes in, government regulation and legislation, including, but not limited to, pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation; (vi) our participation in the federal governments Medicare Part D program; (vii) adverse developments in the healthcare or pharmaceutical industry generally, including, but not limited to, developments in any investigation related to the pharmaceutical industry that may be conducted by governmental authorities; (viii) adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits or investigations; (ix) the availability of prescription drug products in the marketplace as affected by product recalls and voluntary product withdrawals by manufacturers; (x) our ability to complete the proposed Merger with CVS; and (xi) the impact of the exchange offer commenced by Express Scripts. Changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition. There are various legal matters which, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 38 Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information about our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2006 over2005 2005 over2004 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Net revenue (1)(2) $ 36,750,203 $ 32,991,251 $ 25,801,121 11.4 % 27.9 % Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation)(1)(3) 34,344,126 30,888,945 24,192,434 11.2 % 27.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (4) 546,278 474,036 430,990 15.2 % 10.0 % Depreciation 102,286 100,112 86,530 2.2 % 15.7 % Amortization of intangible assets 43,456 47,258 37,288 8.0 % 26.7 % Merger, integration and other related expenses 125 11,076 25,184 98.9 % 56.0 % Interest (income) expense, net (38,374 ) (2,953 ) 31,039 1199.5 % N/M Gain on treasury lock (17,077 ) N/M N/M Non operating gain, net (25,688 ) 100.0 % N/M 34,980,820 31,492,786 24,803,465 11.1 % 27.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 1,769,383 1,498,465 997,656 18.1 % 50.2 % Provision for income taxes 695,368 566,094 397,347 22.8 % 42.5 % Net income $ 1,074,015 $ 932,371 $ 600,309 15.2 % 55.3 % Net income per common share diluted $ 2.46 $ 2.05 $ 1.43 20.0 % 43.4 % Operating Income (5) $ 1,713,932 $ 1,469,824 $ 1,028,695 16.6 % 42.9 % Operating Margin 4.66 % 4.46 % 3.99 % EBITDA (6) $ 1,859,674 $ 1,642,882 $ 1,152,513 13.2 % 42.5 % EBITDA Margin 5.06 % 4.98 % 4.47 % Net cash provided by (used in): Continuing operations $ 1,230,378 $ 1,305,835 $ 1,602,743 5.8 % 18.5 % Investing activities $ 204,366 $ (571,022 ) $ (680,209 ) N/M 16.1 % Financing activities $ (1,891,324 ) $ (537,071 ) $ (648,891 ) 252.2 % 17.2 % Discontinued operations $ (8,270 ) $ (7,662 ) $ (10,168 ) 7.9 % 24.6 % Revenues: Mail service $ 12,549,224 $ 11,593,962 $ 8,015,370 8.2 % 44.6 % Retail (1) 23,887,520 21,109,339 17,553,502 13.2 % 20.3 % Other (2) 313,459 287,950 232,249 8.9 % 24.0 % $ 36,750,203 $ 32,991,251 $ 25,801,121 11.4 % 27.9 % Cost of revenues: Drug ingredient cost (1) $ 33,369,809 $ 29,986,646 $ 23,468,818 11.3 % 27.8 % Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues (3) 974,317 902,299 723,616 8.0 % 24.7 % $ 34,344,126 $ 30,888,945 $ 24,192,434 11.2 % 27.7 % Pharmacy claims processed: Mail 59,692 58,301 42,831 2.4 % 36.1 % Retail (7) 456,815 477,953 441,386 4.4 % 8.3 % 516,507 536,254 484,217 3.7 % 10.7 % 39 Index to Financial Statements (1) Includes approximately $5.8 billion, $5.5 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of amounts paid by individual participants in our customers benefit plans directly to the third party pharmacies in our retail networks (i.e., retail copayments). (2) Includes $10.6 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from a change in estimate related to a settlement with a former AdvancePCS client. (3) Cost of revenues excludes allocable depreciation of approximately $88.6 million, $86.0 million and $72.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are included in total depreciation for each period. (4) Includes share based compensation of $41.1 million, $10.5 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (5) Operating Income equals net revenue less cost of revenue; selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and merger, integration and other related expenses. Operating Income is computed in accordance with SEC rules; however, it is subject to the same limitations as our presentation of EBITDA as described at (6) below. (6) We believe that EBITDA, which is a non GAAP financial measure, is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate a companys overall operating performance, its ability to incur and service debt and its capacity for making capital expenditures. We use EBITDA, in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities, to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that it is important for investors to be able to evaluate our company using the same measures used by our management. EBITDA can be reconciled to net cash provided by continuing operations, which we believe to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 1,074,015 $ 932,371 $ 600,309 Depreciation and amortization 145,742 147,370 123,818 Interest (income) expense, net (38,374 ) (2,953 ) 31,039 Gain on treasury lock (17,077 ) Provision for income taxes 695,368 566,094 397,347 EBITDA 1,859,674 1,642,882 1,152,513 Cash interest receipts (payments), net 34,535 1,754 (38,091 ) Cash tax (payments) refunds, net (709,485 ) (30,649 ) 19,490 Non operating gain, net (25,688 ) Other non cash expenses 41,403 12,697 23,863 Other changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions/disposals of businesses 4,251 (295,161 ) 444,968 Net cash provided by continuing operations $ 1,230,378 $ 1,305,835 $ 1,602,743 EBITDA does not represent funds available for our discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flow from operations data as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from EBITDA are significant components of our statement of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of our overall financial performance. EBITDA and the associated year to year trends should not be considered in isolation. Our calculation of EBITDA may not be consistent with calculations of EBITDA used by other companies. (7) Includes 31.8 million and 29.8 million claims for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to a large health plan customer for which we recorded revenue using the net revenue recognition method. The contract with this customer was terminated in October 2005. 40 Index to Financial Statements Pro Forma Operating Results The following table sets forth selected pro forma information about our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. This pro forma information was prepared as if the AdvancePCS Acquisition had been consummated at the beginning of each respective period. Additional information concerning the pro forma presentation appears in Note 3, Merger Agreement with CVS and Acquisition of AdvancePCS, to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Pro Forma Year Ended December 31, PercentageIncrease/(Decrease) 2005 2004 (In thousands, except per share amounts) Net revenue $ 32,991,251 $ 30,410,924 8.5 % Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) 30,888,945 28,653,330 7.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 474,036 500,579 5.3 % Depreciation 100,112 96,631 3.6 % Amortization of intangible assets 47,258 48,331 2.2 % Interest (income) expense, net (2,953 ) 31,149 N/M Non operating gain, net (25,688 ) N/M 31,481,710 29,330,020 7.3 % Income before provision for income taxes 1,509,541 1,080,904 39.7 % Provision for income taxes 570,469 430,252 32.6 % Net income $ 939,072 $ 650,652 44.3 % Net income per common share diluted $ 2.06 $ 1.40 47.1 % Revenues: Mail service $ 11,593,962 $ 8,706,916 33.2 % Retail 21,109,339 21,402,585 1.4 % Other 287,950 301,423 4.5 % $ 32,991,251 $ 30,410,924 8.5 % Cost of revenues: Drug ingredient cost $ 29,986,646 $ 27,828,008 7.8 % Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues 902,299 825,322 9.3 % $ 30,888,945 $ 28,653,330 7.8 % Pharmacy claims processed: Mail 58,301 47,013 24.0 % Retail 477,953 544,859 12.3 % 536,254 591,872 9.4 % Results of operations for 2006 compared to 2005 Net Revenue. Net revenue increased by $3.8 billion, or 11.4%, to $36.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $33.0 billion in 2005. Revenue growth primarily reflects increases due to Medicare Part D, mail service growth and drug cost inflation partially offset by client terminations and a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs (which have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers) that had the effect of reducing revenues. Excluding the impact of higher generic dispensing rates, revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have increased approximately 16.5% over the 2005 amount. Revenues from mail service claims increased $955.3 million, or 8.2%, to $12.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $11.6 billion in 2005. This increase results from an increase in mail service claim 41 Index to Financial Statements volume of approximately 2.4% and an increase in average revenue per mail service claim of 5.7%. The increase in mail service claim volume is related to changes in utilization from existing customers and new volumes resulting primarily from the Medicare Part D program and new client starts, offset by client terminations. The increase in average revenue per mail service claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed partially offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates as described above. Our mail service generic dispensing rate was 42.7% in the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a mail service generic dispensing rate of 39.9% in 2005. Revenues from retail claims increased $2.8 billion, or 13.2%, to $23.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $21.1 billion in 2005. This increase is primarily related to revenue from new client starts, including revenue related to the Medicare Part D program generally, as well as the impact of additional Medicare Part D services provided to a large health plan client under a revised contract beginning in the second quarter of 2006, offset by client terminations. Retail claim volumes increased from the prior year period after excluding claim volume of a large health plan customer with 31.8 million claims in the year ended December 31, 2005 for which we recorded revenue using the net revenue recognition method. The contract with this health plan customer was terminated in October 2005. Approximately 4.1% of the increase in average revenue per retail claim reflects increases in the unit prices of products dispensed, with the remainder accounted for by changes in customer and claims mix between the periods, including the impact of the Medicare Part D program, partially offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates. Our retail generic dispensing rate was 56.7% in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a retail generic dispensing rate of 53.2% in 2005. Other revenue increased $25.5 million, or 8.9%, to $313.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $288.0 million in 2005. This increase includes the $10.6 million favorable change in estimate in the year ended December 31, 2006 related to a settlement with a former AdvancePCS client. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased $3.5 billion, or 11.2%, to $34.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $30.9 billion in 2005. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by 0.2% as a percentage of net revenue compared to the same period in 2005. Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues increased by $72.0 million, or 8.0%, to $974.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 from $902.3 million in 2005. This increase relates primarily to an increase in services related to Medicare Part D claims and increased mail utilization. Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues as a percentage of net revenue remained flat at 2.7% in both periods. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 15.2% on an absolute basis and increased as a percentage of net revenue, to 1.49% from 1.44%. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflects increased share based compensation cost as a result of adopting FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Share based compensation cost totaled $41.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $10.5 million in 2005. The increase in share based compensation cost resulted in a 6.4% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining 8.8% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is related to growth in our business, including growth associated with our Medicare Part D program. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements below for a discussion of our adoption of FAS 123R and the impact on our financial statements. Depreciation. Depreciation increased in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies and customer care centers. Amortization of Intangible Assets. The amortization of intangible assets recorded in 2006 and 2005 was related entirely to the intangible assets acquired from AdvancePCS. 42 Index to Financial Statements Merger, Integration and Other Related Expenses. In 2006, we recorded $5.4 million of expenses related to the proposed Merger with CVS, offset by a $5.3 million gain from an insurance settlement related to the AdvancePCS Acquisition. Interest (Income) Expense, Net. The change in net interest (income) expense in 2006 resulted from (i) a $25.0 million increase in interest income due primarily to an increase in interest rates and (ii) a $10.4 million decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our 7.375% senior notes in October 2006. Gain on Treasury Lock. Gain on treasury lock is comprised of a $17.1 million gain on a treasury lock that was previously accounted for as a cash flow hedge. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the treasury lock no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment due to our determination that we would not issue 10 year fixed rate debt to replace our 7.375% senior notes. The treasury lock matured and was settled in the fourth quarter of 2006. Provision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was recorded using a 39.3% effective tax rate on book income in 2006 and a 37.8% effective tax rate on book income in 2005. Our provision for income taxes in 2005 includes a one time positive adjustment primarily to reflect resolution of income tax uncertainties from prior periods. Excluding the effect of the one time positive adjustment to the provision for income taxes in 2005, the effective tax rate on book income in 2006 decreased 0.2% from 2005. The decrease related to differences in effective aggregate state tax rates. Results of operations for 2005 compared to 2004 AdvancePCS Operating Results. The results of operations of AdvancePCS are included in our statement of income beginning March 24, 2004. The primary factor influencing the comparison of our results of operations for 2005 compared to 2004 was the AdvancePCS Acquisition. Net Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $7.2 billion to approximately $33.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2005, from approximately $25.8 billion in 2004. On a pro forma basis, net revenue increased by approximately $2.6 billion, or 8.5%, to approximately $33.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2005, from approximately $30.4 billion in 2004. Pro forma revenue growth primarily reflects increases due to drug cost inflation partially offset by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs, which have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers, that had the effect of reducing revenues. Excluding the impact of higher generic dispensing rates, pro forma revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, would have increased approximately 13.3% over the pro forma 2004 amount. On a pro forma basis, revenues from mail service claims increased approximately $2.9 billion, or 33.2 %, to approximately $11.6 billion in 2005 from approximately $8.7 billion in 2004. This increase results from an increase in mail service claim volume of approximately 24.0 % and an increase in average revenue per mail service claim of approximately 7.4 %. The mail service claim volume increases are related to increases from both new customers and the percentage of mail service claims (adjusted for differences in average days supply) to total pharmacy claims, referred to as our mail penetration rate. The increase in mail service claim volume and the mail penetration rate during 2005 is due primarily to the fact that new customer starts in 2005 were substantially mail order, while several large retail oriented customers terminated during 2004 and 2005. On a pro forma basis, our mail penetration rate was approximately 26.5% in 2005, compared to a mail penetration rate of 20.2% in 2004. The increase in average revenue per mail service claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates as described above. On a pro forma basis, our mail service generic dispensing rate was 39.9% in 2005, compared to a mail service generic dispensing rate of 37.9% in 2004. On a pro forma basis, revenues from retail claims decreased approximately $293.3 million, or 1.4%, to approximately $21.1 billion in 2005 from approximately $21.4 billion in 2004. This decrease is the result of a 43 Index to Financial Statements decrease in retail claim volume of approximately 12.3% offset by an increase in average revenue per retail claim of approximately 2.0%. The increase in average revenue per retail claim reflects increases in the prices of products dispensed offset by the effects of higher generic dispensing rates. On a pro forma basis, our retail generic dispensing rate was 53.2% in 2005, compared to a retail generic dispensing rate of 49.0% in 2004. The retail claim volume decrease is primarily related to the termination of several large retail oriented accounts as described above. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased approximately $6.7 billion to approximately $30.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2005, from approximately $24.2 billion in 2004. Pro forma cost of revenues for 2005 as a percentage of net revenue, decreased by 0.6% compared to 2004 and was favorably impacted by economies of scale resulting from the AdvancePCS Acquisition. Pro forma cost of revenue growth and cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenue were also impacted by a higher dispensing rate of generic drugs which have lower prices but result in healthcare cost savings for our customers. Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues increased by approximately $77.0 million, or 9.3%, on a pro forma basis to approximately $902.3 million in 2005 from approximately $825.3 million in 2004. This increase relates primarily to additional customer service center and pharmacy costs incurred to service the overall increases in mail service claims in 2005 from levels experienced in 2004. Pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenues remained flat as a percentage of revenue on a pro forma basis at 2.7% in 2005 and 2004. In addition, during 2005, the company incurred additional expenses to implement the substantial amount of net new business, which was weighted significantly toward mail service. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in 2005, due primarily to the AdvancePCS Acquisition. On a pro forma basis, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 5.3% on an absolute basis and decreased as a percentage of net revenue, to 1.44% from 1.65%. Pro forma selling, general and administrative expenses includes $10.5 million of share based compensation (related to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options held by AdvancePCS optionees on the date of the AdvancePCS Acquisition) in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $28.2 million in 2004. The $17.7 million decrease in share based compensation cost resulted in a 3.5% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining 1.8% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses reflects the impact of elimination of duplicative costs subsequent to the AdvancePCS Acquisition. Depreciation. Depreciation increased in 2005 due primarily to the AdvancePCS Acquisition. Depreciation increased in 2005 on a pro forma basis, due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies and customer service centers. Amortization of Intangible Assets. The amortization of intangible assets recorded in 2005 and 2004 was related entirely to the intangible assets acquired from AdvancePCS on March 24, 2004. Interest (Income) Expense, Net. The change in net interest (income) expense in 2005 resulted primarily from increased interest income generated by cash on hand and short term investments and a decrease in interest expense on long term debt due to principal repayments. Merger, Integration and Other Related Expenses. The decrease in integration and other related expenses primarily reflects costs incurred for outside consulting services for integration planning activities in 2004 that were not incurred in 2005. We incurred approximately $11.1 million of integration and other related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily for integration activities related to our acquisition of AdvancePCS and involuntary termination/employee retention and related benefits. We incurred approximately $25.2 million of integration and other related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisting primarily of: (1) approximately $3.9 million for involuntary termination benefits; (2) a writeoff of approximately $2.2 million of deferred loan costs for indebtedness retired in conjunction with the closing of the AdvancePCS Acquisition; (3) approximately $8 million of integration planning activities related to the AdvancePCS Acquisition and 44 Index to Financial Statements (4) approximately $6 million related to retention benefit obligations under the AdvancePCS retention plan. The balance of the costs incurred in 2004 relate primarily to payments to outside service vendors used for various integration related projects. Non Operating Gain, Net. Non operating gain, net is primarily comprised of a $27.9 million gain on the sale of our remaining investment in a private company that was formerly one of our subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was recorded using a 37.8% effective tax rate on book income in 2005 compared to an approximately 39.8% effective tax rate on book income in 2004. The decrease related to a positive adjustment to the provision for income taxes, primarily to reflect resolution of income tax uncertainties from prior periods. Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources General. We broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments. In addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives. Therefore, liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments. The following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Net cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in): Continuing operations $ 1,230,378 Investing activities 204,366 Financing activities (1,891,324 ) Discontinued operations (8,270 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2006 (464,850 ) Cash and cash equivalents December 31, 2005 1,268,883 Cash and cash equivalents December 31, 2006 $ 804,033 December 31,2006 December 31,2005 (2) Net working capital (1)(2) $ 128,708 $ 933,231 Long term debt (2)(3): Fixed rate debt $ $ 386,600 Availability under revolving credit facility $ 740,618 $ 386,600 (1) Working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities. (2) The December 31, 2005 net working capital and fixed rate long term debt amounts reflect the classification of $386.6 million of our 7.375% senior notes due 2006 as long term debt due to our intent and ability to refinance this amount on a long term basis at the time of filing of our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. The amount classified as long term debt was limited to the availability under our revolving credit facility and the remaining $63.4 million of our 7.375% senior notes due 2006 is classified as a current liability as of December 31, 2005. We ultimately did not refinance the notes on a long term basis and repaid the entire $450 million principal amount of the notes using cash on hand when they matured in October 2006. (3) See Credit Facility below for information on our amended credit facility. 45 Index to Financial Statements Cash Flows from Continuing Operations. Our performance relative to net cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted from factors discussed above related to income from continuing operations and certain changes in non cash working capital. The decline in operating cash flow compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by cash payments of federal income taxes in 2006 after we utilized the majority of our federal net operating loss carryforward in 2005. Income tax payments, net of refunds, increased to $709.5 million in 2006 from $30.6 million in 2005. In addition, as discussed under Recent Accounting Pronouncements, FAS 123R changed the statement of cash flow classification of the excess tax benefit resulting from the exercise of stock options. Excess tax benefits were reported as cash flows from operating activities in 2005, but are reported as cash flows from financing activities in 2006. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash flows from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily include $296.9 million from the sale of available for sale securities and $17.1 million in proceeds from the settlement of our treasury lock offset by $107.5 million of capital expenditures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. In October 2006, we repaid the entire $450 million principal balance of our 7.375% senior notes due 2006. We also made payments of approximately $1.4 billion to repurchase 29.8 million shares of our common stock and dividend payments of $84.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. These payments were offset by (i) net proceeds of approximately $65.2 million from issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans, including exercises of stock options, and (ii) approximately $21.4 million of tax benefit received for the amount of income tax deductions for option exercises in excess of compensation cost recognized for those options including pro forma share based compensation cost for periods prior to January 1, 2006. Credit Facility. On August 31, 2006, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Restated Credit Agreement) that provides for a five year, $750 million revolving bank credit facility maturing on August 30, 2011. The Restated Credit Agreement replaced our previous bank credit facility, which included a $400 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 23, 2009. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $740.6 million available for borrowing under the revolving bank credit facility, exclusive of approximately $9.4 million reserved under letters of credit. The credit facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and contains restrictive covenants. The guarantees and covenants applicable to the credit facility are described in further detail in Note 8, Long Term Debt, Derivative Financial Instrument and Interest Rate Risk Management, to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page F 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Senior Notes. Our 7.375% senior notes due 2006, with an aggregate principal amount of $450 million, matured and were repaid in October 2006. Outlook Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview. Currently, our liquidity needs arise primarily from: (i) working capital requirements, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) dividend payments. Additionally, we have acquired businesses recently, may continue to acquire additional businesses in the future, subject to compliance with the Merger Agreement, and could fund any such acquisition using cash on hand and short term investments, availability under our revolving credit facility, or a combination thereof. We believe that our cash on hand, short term investments, cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Stock Repurchase Program. We are authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock on the open market under our previously announced repurchase program and subsequent amendments. Repurchases under the program will occur at times and in amounts that management deems appropriate, subject to compliance with the Merger Agreement, and we had repurchased approximately 59.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.4 billion under this program through September 30, 2006. No repurchases have been made subsequent to September 30, 2006. 46 Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Continuing Operations. We have various contractual obligations and or commercial commitments arising from both our continuing and discontinued operations. These obligations and commitments are more fully described in this Annual Report on Form 10 K under various headings in MD&A as well as in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page F 1. The following table lists the aggregate maturities of letter of credit obligations and expiration amounts of lease commitments related to our continuing operations at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments due under contractual obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Long term debt letters of credit (1) $ 9,382 $ $ $ 9,382 $ Operating leases (2) 296,009 45,547 81,207 65,793 103,462 $ 305,391 $ 45,547 $ 81,207 $ 75,175 $ 103,462 (1) See Historical Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Facility and financial statement Note 8, Long Term Debt, Derivative Financial Instrument and Interest Rate Risk Management. (2) See financial statement Note 9, Operating Leases. (3) Certain of our vendor contracts contain commitments or penalties for early termination. These commitments do not relate to pharmaceutical purchases and are not material to our results of operations or financial position. See Discontinued Operations, Including Off Balance Sheet Guarantees for information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments related to our discontinued operations. Discontinued Operations, Including Off Balance Sheet Guarantees. Future cash needed to fund the remaining liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs was estimated to be approximately $14.7 million, in aggregate, at December 31, 2006, consisting primarily of accruals for real estate leases and legal disputes. We have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising from our discontinued operations. These primarily include obligations under various leases for commercial real estate. These leases had aggregate remaining rental payments, net of amounts to be paid to us under subleases, of approximately $5.9 million at December 31, 2006, due as follows: 2007 $0.7 million; 2008/2009 $3.0 million and 2010/20011 $2.2 million. Additionally, we are named as guarantor or obligor on additional discontinued operations real estate leases which we assigned to third parties. The aggregate amount of these guarantees totaled approximately $32.0 million at December 31, 2006, and expires as follows: 2007 $7.4 million; 2008/2009 $11.5 million; 2010/2011 $6.9 million and after 2011 $6.2 million. Merger Agreement. We have entered into a Merger Agreement with CVS and have agreed to pay a fee of $675 million to CVS if the Merger Agreement is terminated under any of the following circumstances: the Caremark Rx board of directors makes a change in recommendation; Caremark Rx willfully and materially breaches certain obligations not to solicit acquisition proposals or fails to call a stockholders meeting to vote on the Merger Agreement and the Merger; or the Merger is not consummated by November 1, 2007 (or, May 1, 2008, if extended as permitted in the Merger Agreement) or Caremark Rxs stockholders fail to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the Merger, in each case, only if (i) a third party has made an acquisition proposal before the Caremark Rx special meeting and (ii) within 12 months of the termination of the Merger Agreement, Caremark Rx enters into an alternative transaction. In addition, whether or not the Merger is completed, the uncertainty related to the proposed Merger could adversely impact our business through several factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our current clients may 47 Index to Financial Statements experience uncertainty associated with the Merger and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us; (ii) we may face additional challenges in competing for new and renewal business; and (iii) pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management companies or other vendors or suppliers may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us. Approximately one third of a PBMs customer base typically is subject to renewal each year, and therefore we may face additional challenges in competing for new business and retaining or renewing business. Our largest client, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, is currently subject to renewal for services beginning January 1, 2008. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure renewal of this business; however, such renewal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if the Merger is not completed or of the combined company if the Merger is completed. See Item 1, Business Proposed Merger with CVS for further information concerning this proposed Merger. Express Scripts Exchange Offer. On January 16, 2007, Express Scripts launched an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Caremark Rx common stock for (a) $29.25 in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest and (b) 0.426 shares of Express Scripts common stock for each share of Caremark Rx common stock. On January 24, 2007, our board of directors reaffirmed that the Express Scripts proposal does not constitute, and is not reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and that engaging in discussions with Express Scripts is not in the best interests of Caremark Rx and its stockholders. Express Scripts exchange offer, and its ongoing solicitation of proxies from Caremark Rx stockholders to vote against the CVS Merger, could impact or cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including: our current clients may experience uncertainty associated with the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us; we may face additional challenges in competing for new and renewal business, and the pendency or completion of any acquisition of Caremark Rx by Express Scripts could result in customer attrition, including an estimated $8 billion in lost revenue and a $300 million reduction in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), a metric commonly used to gauge a companys profitability and financial health; our employees or prospective employees may experience uncertainty about job security, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key managers and other employees; the attention of our management may be directed toward considerations related to the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may be diverted from the day to day business operations of our business; and pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management companies or other vendors or suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the exchange offer and proxy solicitation and may seek to modify or terminate their business relationships with us. Planned Capital Expenditures. We expect capital expenditures for 2007 to total approximately $150 million. This amount could vary significantly depending on the timing of projects and related expenditures. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Share Based Compensation. We offer participation in our stock option plans to certain employees and directors, as described further in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and in Note 10, Stockholders Equity, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and offer participation in our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) to all employees. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123R 48 Index to Financial Statements using the modified prospective transition method described therein. Accordingly, on January 1, 2006, we began recognizing compensation cost from share based payment arrangements based on their grant date fair value. Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (i) compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123), and (ii) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. We recognized approximately $41.1 million in share based compensation cost related to employee stock option and ESPP transactions in the year ended December 31, 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2006 for share based compensation arrangements was approximately $16.0 million. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for options to purchase our common stock under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related interpretations, as permitted by FAS 123. Under APB 25, we recognized share based compensation cost based on the difference in the market price and the exercise price (the intrinsic value) of options at their grant date. The exercise price of option grants under our stock based compensation plans is equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date; therefore, no share based compensation cost related to stock options, other than share based compensation cost for the replacement stock options issued in connection with the acquisition of AdvancePCS, was recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We recognized approximately $10.5 million and $20.0 million of share based compensation cost in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options issued to AdvancePCS optionees in exchange for their AdvancePCS options upon completion of our acquisition of AdvancePCS on March 24, 2004. As a result of adopting FAS 123R as required, our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006, are $37.3 million and $23.5 million lower, respectively, and our basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 are $.06 and $.05 lower, respectively, than if we had not adopted FAS 123R. In addition, FAS 123R changed the statement of cash flows classification of the excess tax benefit resulting from the exercise of stock options from a cash flow from operating activities to a cash flow from financing activities. The $21.4 million excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been classified as an operating cash inflow if we had not adopted FAS 123R. Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 have not been restated. As of December 31, 2006, we had $86.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements that are expected to vest. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years. The fair value of awards with graded vesting granted prior to January 1, 2006 was determined using the multiple option approach, and the related compensation cost is recognized using the accelerated recognition method found in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 28. The fair value of awards with graded vesting granted after January 1, 2006 is determined using the multiple option approach, and the related compensation cost is recognized using the straight line recognition method. We expect the majority of our outstanding nonvested options to vest. Income Taxes. The FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), in July 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a two step recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It requires that an individual tax position meet a more likely than not threshold for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in a companys financial statements. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim 49 Index to Financial Statements periods, and disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN 48 on our financial statements; however, we do not expect FIN 48 to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of December 31, 2006, we had no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in place and no outstanding balances with respect to debt instruments and believe that our exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments, principally interest rate risk inherent in our short term investments portfolio, is not material.
