Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors in this Annual Report. The historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results. Executive Overview We are a leading provider of comprehensive, integrated programs and services focused on wellness, disease and condition management, productivity enhancement and informatics. This suite of services, which we call Health Enhancement, is designed to reduce health related costs and enhance the health and quality of life of the individuals we serve. We are dedicated to developing better educated, motivated and self enabled healthcare consumers and supporting clinicians in managing the care of their patients. We provide services to self insured employers, private and government sponsored health plans, pharmaceutical companies and patients. Our employer clients are primarily Fortune 1000 companies that self insure the medical benefits provided to their employees, dependents and retirees. Our health plan customers are regional and national health plans, as well as government sponsored health plans, such as state Medicaid programs. Our on line, interactive wellness programs address issues such as: smoking cessation, weight loss, exercise, healthier diet, stress relief, healthy aging, and productivity enhancement. These programs are designed to help employees and health plan members live healthier and longer lives while reducing their healthcare costs and increasing their productivity. Our disease and condition management programs focus on the most costly medical conditions including, without limitation, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, depression, musculoskeletal and chronic pain, hepatitis C, cancer and high risk pregnancies. We assist individuals to better manage their conditions by increasing their knowledge about their illnesses or conditions, potential complications and the importance of medication and treatment plan compliance. Depending on acuity, our specialized nurses proactively contact participants to monitor their progress and ensure they are following the plan of care set by their physician. Acquisitions and Dispositions On January 19, 2006, we completed the acquisition of CorSolutions Medical, Inc. (CorSolutions), a disease management, health and wellness and productivity enhancement organization. The results of CorSolutions operations are included in our results of operations effective January 1, 2006. On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of WinningHabits, Inc., a premier provider of corporate wellness programs. On April 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of the business and assets of Miavita LLC, a leading provider of on line health and wellness programs. Results of operations of these businesses were included in the results of operations from the respective acquisition dates. During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we completed the divestitures of Facet Technologies LLC (Facet) and our foreign diabetes service operations in Germany (Dia Real), respectively. We made the strategic decision to divest Facet and Dia Real in the fourth quarter of 2005. In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, their assets and liabilities were reclassified as Assets held for sale and Liabilities related to assets held for sale and other discontinued operations, respectively, on the December 31, 2005, consolidated balance sheet, and their results of operations are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. On June 30, 2004, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets, excluding trade and certain other receivables, of our domestic direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business. As a result of the sale of 18 the domestic pharmacy and supplies business and the discontinuance of the lab business, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of these divisions as discontinued operations in 2004 and 2005. Financial and Performance Highlights of 2006 For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported $336.1 million in net revenues, a growth of 87.5% over the year ended December 31, 2005. We also reported $18.5 million of earnings from continuing operations, compared to earnings from continuing operations of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.85 per common share, compared to $0.20 per common share in 2005. During 2006, we also had the following financial and performance highlights. These accomplishments should be considered in conjunction with our discussion of operating results, liquidity and capital resources. Completed the acquisition of CorSolutions, and integrated this business operations and the operations of Miavita and WinningHabits, capturing significant synergies and operating efficiencies made available through the combination of the companies; Completed the divestitures of our non core businesses, Facet and Dia Real, establishing the Company as a pure play in the wellness and disease management market; Accomplished our goal of reducing acquisition indebtedness by $175 million, leaving us with approximately $277 million of acquisition debt remaining at December 31, 2006; Refinanced our $65 million Second Lien Credit Facility, producing interest savings in 2006 and beyond; and Invested in and formed a strategic alliance with Secured Independence, Inc. to address the needs of the long term care insurance market for seniors. Business Strategy Our goal is to position ourselves as an industry leader in the health enhancement market. We seek to achieve this goal by pursuing the following strategies: Capitalize on our Position as a Pure Play in the Health Enhancement Market. We believe our extensive experience, scalable, established infrastructure and demonstrated clinical and financial outcomes will provide us a significant competitive advantage as we seek to capitalize on the growing market for health enhancement. Including our predecessor organizations, we have more than 15 years of experience in providing disease management and related services. Our established infrastructure includes our proprietary informatics technology platform, care center operations located throughout the United States and a national network of skilled multi disciplinary clinicians. Leverage Our Information Technology. We will continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems in order to better identify participants for intervention and improve treatment plans for these identified participants by reducing variations in care by consistent applications of national criteria and standards of care. We expect to leverage this technology through the expansion of our informatics business. 19 Further Penetrate All Key Segments of the Growing Health Enhancement Market. We intend to expand our customer base within the employer, health plan, state and federal governments, and pharmaceutical markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our health enhancement business by cross selling other products and services to existing customers as they realize the cost savings and superior clinical outcomes that our programs provide. Results of Operations The following table summarizes key components in our financial statements for continuing operations expressed as a percentage of revenues. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 32.7 % 40.7 % 44.8 % Gross margin 67.3 % 59.3 % 55.2 % Selling and administrative expenses 47.3 % 52.6 % 54.7 % Provision for doubtful accounts 1.2 % 1.9 % 1.7 % Amortization of intangible assets 2.1 % 0.2 % 0.0 % Operating earnings (loss) 16.6 % 4.5 % 1.1 % Interest expense, net 7.7 % 0.9 % 6.6 % Other income, net 0.4 % 0.1 % 0.5 % Loss on retirement of Senior Notes 0.0 % 0.0 % 15.8 % Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 9.3 % 3.8 % 23.0 % Income tax expense (benefit) 3.8 % 1.5 % 9.2 % Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 5.5 % 2.2 % 13.8 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Revenues from continuing operations increased by $156.9 million, or 87.5%, to $336.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $179.2 million in 2005. This increase was due primarily to our acquisitions of CorSolutions effective January 1, 2006, Winning Habits on October 1, 2005, and Miavita on April 1, 2005. Revenues from these acquired businesses contributed $135.9 million, or 86.6%, to the 2006 increase. Also contributing to the revenue growth was the addition of new and expanded accounts that were implemented in 2005 and 2006. Excluding maternity management program revenues, disease and condition management program revenues, including wellness program revenues, increased $151.2 million, or 195.4%, to $228.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Wellness program revenues were $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $4.9 million in 2005. Maternity management program revenues increased $5.7 million, or 5.6%, to $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was due to an increase in the days of service and an increase in the portion of our maternity management programs generating revenues as a result of electronic identification of potential patients. Cost of revenues consists primarily of clinical labor and supplies related to the provision of services. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from 40.7% in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to the growth in the disease management and wellness program revenues and improved margins from these programs resulting from the leveraging impact of higher revenues. Selling and administrative expenses increased $64.7 million to $159.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $94.3 million in 2005. We incurred increased costs as a result of our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, primarily for salaries and other personnel related expenses and increased depreciation and amortization expenses related to our technology investments. Also included in our 2006 expense is approximately $7.0 million of share based compensation associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). As a percentage of revenues, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 47.3% in 2006, compared to 52.6% in 2005, primarily due to the leveraging impact of higher revenues and the synergies realized from the integration of the CorSolutions acquisition in 2006. 20 The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues was 1.2% in 2006 compared to 1.9% in 2005. The provision, which is recorded primarily for our maternity management program revenues, is adjusted periodically based upon our quarterly evaluation of historical collection experience, recoveries of amounts previously provided, industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors. The percentage decrease results from an increase in the portion of revenues from our non maternity management program sources. We recorded $7.1 million and $365,000 of expense in 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the amortization of intangible assets. The increase in amortization expense resulted primarily from our 2006 acquisition of CorSolutions. Interest expense, net, increased to $26.0 million in 2006 from $1.6 million in 2005. This increase was primarily the result of the new credit facilities we entered into in January 2006 in conjunction with our acquisition of CorSolutions (discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities). In 2006, we allocated $9.8 million of interest expense and amortization expense of deferred financing fees related to the new credit facilities to discontinued operations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 87 24, Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations. EITF Issue 87 24 states that interest on debt that must be repaid when the disposal of discontinued operations occurs should be allocated to discontinued operations. In accordance with the terms of the new credit facilities, we used the net proceeds from the sales of Facet in the third quarter of 2006 and Dia Real in the fourth quarter of 2006 to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness. The weighted average interest rates, including amortization of debt discount and expense and net gains from interest rate swap transactions, on all outstanding indebtedness were 9.29% and 6.80% for years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other income (expense), net, increased to $1.3 million in 2006 from $226,000 in 2005. In 2006, we recorded a $741,000 gain from the settlement of the forward exchange agreement we entered into with a bank to eliminate the potential impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the expected euro proceeds from the sale of Dia Real. Under the terms of the agreement, we sold 26.0 million at the forward rate and received approximately $33.4 million on the settlement date. We reported the forward exchange agreement at fair value until settled in October 2006. Other income also includes collections of notes and receivables that were previously written off, royalties and other miscellaneous items in both periods and favorable currency adjustments on a euro denominated receivable in 2005. Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, reflects a higher effective tax rate than the statutory federal tax rate due to state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for tax purposes. Cash outflows for income taxes for continuing and discontinued operations in 2006 and 2005 were $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, comprised of foreign, federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes. As of December 31, 2006, our remaining net operating loss carryforwards of $67.0 million, the tax effect of which is reflected on the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset, will be available to offset future taxable income. On September 1, 2006, we completed the sale of Facet for net cash proceeds of $121.9 million and recorded a gain on the sale of $26.6 million, or $23.9 million, net of income taxes. We wrote off $76.2 million of goodwill and recorded $541,000 for unamortized share based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of options granted to the Facet employees. On October 17, 2006, we completed the sale of Dia Real for net cash proceeds of $33.3 million. The gain on the sale was $9.1 million, or $5.0 million net of income taxes, and included charges of $3.6 million for net goodwill and intangibles and $67,000 for unamortized share based compensation. The net proceeds from these sales were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our First Lien Credit Facility (see below). Earnings from discontinued operations include the operations of Facet, Dia Real and our domestic direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business (sold on June 30, 2004). Earnings from discontinued operations were $5.3 million, net of tax, in 2006 compared to $9.9 million in 2005. Discontinued operations in 2006 include a pre tax expense of $9.8 million for the allocation of interest and deferred financing fees to Facet and Dia Real related to the new credit facilities as described above; $1.1 million of this amount was charged to 21 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. In 2005, we recorded a $10 million pre tax charge for the settlement of the qui tam claims related to our pharmacy and supplies business. The purchaser of the pharmacy and supplies business did not assume the liability for these claims. Our earnings from discontinued operations in 2005 also include a $2 million charge for the write off of the remaining accounts receivable of our pharmacy and supplies business, which we retained after the sale. The collection efforts for these receivables were outsourced to a third party in the first quarter of 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Revenues from continuing operations increased by $34.1 million, or 23.5%, to $179.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $145.1 million in 2004. Disease and condition management program revenues, excluding maternity management program revenues, and wellness program revenues increased $25.0 million, or 47.7%, to $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues from disease management and wellness programs increased due to new and expanded accounts implemented in 2004 and 2005. In 2005, we added wellness programs to our health enhancement services through the acquisition of Miavita on April 1, 2005, and Winning Habits on October 1, 2005. Revenue from these wellness programs were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Maternity management program revenues increased $9.1 million, or 9.8%, to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase was due to an increase in the days of service, the addition of new programs that are beginning to generate revenue growth, as well as a shift in mix of services offered to therapies with a higher average revenue amount per day. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 40.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 44.8% in 2004. This decrease was primarily due to the growth in the disease and condition management and wellness program revenues and improved margins from these programs resulting from the leveraging impact of higher revenues. Selling and administrative expenses increased $15.0 million to $94.3 million in 2005, compared to $79.3 million in 2004. We incurred increased costs for salaries and other personnel related expenses and increased depreciation and amortization expenses related to our technology investments. As a percentage of revenues, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 52.6% in 2005, compared to 54.7% in 2004. The decrease in this percentage was primarily due to higher revenues in 2005. The provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues was 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The provision is adjusted periodically based upon our quarterly evaluation of historical collection experience, recoveries of amounts previously provided, industry reimbursement trends, audit activity and other relevant factors. Interest expense, net, decreased by $8.0 million, or 83.5%, in 2005, compared to 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of the retirement of substantially all of the 11% Senior Notes in June 2004 (discussed below under Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities) partially offset by interest due to the issuance of the 4.875% convertible senior subordinated notes in May 2004. In May 2005, all of the Companys 4.875% convertible senior subordinated notes were converted into common stock of the Company. The weighted average interest rates, including amortization of debt discount and expense and net gains from terminated interest rate swap transactions, on all outstanding indebtedness were 6.80% and 8.62% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other income, net, included income of $226,000 for 2005, compared to $681,000 for 2004. Other income includes collections of notes and receivables that were previously written off, royalties and other miscellaneous items and favorable currency adjustments on a euro denominated receivable in 2005. On March 29, 2004, we commenced a tender offer for all of our unsecured 11% Senior Notes, which had an aggregate principal amount of $122 million. We received valid tenders from holders of $120 million in aggregate principal amount of the 11% Senior Notes. On June 30, 2004, we completed the repurchase of the 11% Senior Notes tendered in the tender offer with proceeds from the issuance of our 4.875% convertible 22 senior subordinated notes and with the proceeds from the sale of assets of the pharmacy and supplies business. The repurchase of substantially all of the 11% Senior Notes resulted in a loss of $22.9 million, or $14.1 million, net of taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, reflected a higher effective tax rate than the statutory federal tax rate due to state and foreign income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for tax purposes. Cash outflows for income taxes in 2005 and 2004, were $4.0 million and $7.7 million, respectively, comprised of foreign, federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes. Earnings from discontinued operations of $9.9 million, net of tax, in 2005 includes a $10 million pre tax charge for the settlement of the qui tam claims and a $2 million pre tax charge for the write off of the remaining accounts receivable of the pharmacy and supplies business described above. In 2004, we recorded a gain on the sale of the pharmacy and supplies business of $30.9 million, net of income taxes of $20.9 million. Goodwill of $16.3 million was charged against the gain. Also in connection with the sale, in 2004 we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts for the retained receivables by $11.9 million to provide for the estimated effects of the sale of the business and 2005 outsourcing of the collection effort to a third party could have on collections. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $19.8 million. Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations was $27.4 million in 2006 compared to $5.0 million in 2005 and $(3.6) million in 2004. This increase in cash from operations was due primarily to an increase in earnings from continuing operations and increases in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and share based compensation. The increase in 2006 was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and in accrued and other liabilities relating primarily to the payment of transaction related expenses incurred in the CorSolutions acquisition. Cash flows from discontinued operations were $(3.1) million, $20.0 million and $13.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, cash flows used in discontinued operations included a $10.0 million settlement payment, net of $150,000 insurance reimbursement, for the two qui tam actions filed against the Company and its former subsidiary, Diabetes Self Care, Inc. This charge was included in earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2006 period also reflects the allocation of $9.8 million in interest expense (before taxes) discussed above. Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding, or DSO, were 54 days and 63 days at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease is due to a lower DSO from our disease management and wellness businesses. Investing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled $(299.4) million in 2006, $(28.9) million in 2005, and $67.8 million in 2004. The increase in net cash used in investing activities is driven primarily by our acquisition and divestiture activities. The results of operations of our acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since their respective acquisition dates. On January 19, 2006, we completed the acquisition of CorSolutions for a cash payment of $434.7 million, net of cash acquired. Also in 2006, we successfully completed the divestitures of Facet on September 1, 2006, for cash proceeds of $119.8 million, net of transaction costs, and Dia Real on October 19, 2006, for cash proceeds of $30.5 million, net of transaction costs. In 2005, cash used in investing activities included $19.7 million for the acquisition of two businesses. On April 1, 2005, we acquired the business and assets of Miavita for a net cash payment of $4.8 million, with 23 additional amounts to be paid in 2006 and 2007 under an earn out agreement. In May 2006, we paid $1.7 million of additional consideration for the first earn out period of this acquisition as a result of certain operating milestones being achieved. The payment was recorded as additional goodwill. On October 1, 2005, we acquired the business of WinningHabits for a net cash payment of $14.9 million, with additional amounts to be paid in 2007 under an earn out agreement. As of December 31, 2006, the estimated additional earn out consideration to be paid under these agreements was approximately $54.2 million. Continuing operations capital expenditures of $13.1 million in 2006, $11.1 million in 2005, and $8.6 million in 2004 relate primarily to the replacement and enhancement of computer information systems and to the replacement of medical devices used in our maternity management programs. Discontinued operations capital expenditures of $379,000 in 2006, $1.5 million in 2005, and $1.6 million in 2004 relate primarily to purchases of machinery and equipment and computer information systems. On June 30, 2004, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets, excluding trade and certain other receivables, of our direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business. At the closing, we received cash proceeds, net of transaction costs, of approximately $101.1 million. We used approximately $20.5 million of the proceeds received from the sale to satisfy the earn out payment owed to the sellers of Quality Oncology and approximately $53 million to complete the funding of our tender offer for our 11% Senior Notes. Restricted cash increased to $1.4 million in 2006 from $550,000 in 2005. We have restricted funds for amounts held in escrow related to customer contracts and as collateral for insurance policies. Generally, such funds are held in interest bearing investment accounts or certificates of deposit. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $271.7 million, $(8.2) million and $(49.1) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On January 19, 2006, we funded the acquisition of CorSolutions with the proceeds from term loans and revolving credit loans pursuant to a credit agreement and a second lien term loan facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative and collateral agent (the New Credit Facilities). The New Credit Facilities, as amended, provide for borrowings of up to an aggregate of $485 million and were divided between a First Lien Credit Facility and a Second Lien Credit Facility. The New Credit Facilities replaced our previous revolving credit facility, which was terminated on January 13, 2006. There were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at the time of termination. At December 31, 2006, the New Credit Facilities consisted of the following: Loan Outstanding Balance at December 31, 2006 Interest Variable Interest Rate at December 31, 2006 Maturity Date First Lien Credit Facility Term Loan B Facility $ 277.2 million LIBOR plus 2.00 % 7.36% to 7.37 % January 19, 2012 Term Loan C Facility (a) $ January 19, 2007 Revolving Credit Facility $ January 19, 2011 Second Lien Credit Facility Term Loan Facility (b) $ LIBOR plus 6.75 % January 19, 2012 (a) We used the net proceeds from the sales of Facet and Dia Real and operating cash flows to prepay the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan C Facility. (b) On November 6, 2006, we amended the terms of the New Credit Facilities and prepaid the Second Lien Credit Facility with proceeds from the First Lien Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan B Facility and the Term Loan C Facility accrue interest at a variable spread over LIBOR, with the applicable spread determined by the Companys consolidated leverage 24 ratio, as described in the applicable credit agreement. Interest rates for these facilities, as well as for the Term Loan Facility, are reset quarterly. Amounts borrowed under the New Credit Facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries. Amounts borrowed under the First Lien Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary guarantors. The New Credit Facilities also provide for a Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable spread over LIBOR or the prime rate, at our option, with the applicable spread determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, as described in the credit agreement. At December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the available balance was $28.5 million. In November 2006, we amended the terms of the New Credit Facilities. Under the amended agreement, the First Lien Credit Facility was increased by $65.0 million, the proceeds of which were used to prepay the Second Lien Credit Facility. Borrowings under the First Lien Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, a 475 basis point reduction from the Second Lien Credit Facility. All the other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (other than those relating to the increased amount of the First Lien Credit Facility and those that are no longer applicable because they relate solely to the Second Lien Credit Facility) remain unchanged. We incurred fees and expenses of approximately $1.7 million, which were recorded as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the term of the First Lien Credit Facility (January 2012). On February 23, 2007, we entered into a third amendment to the New Credit Facilities, the terms of which increased our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $30.0 million to $50.0 million. All other terms of the New Credit Facilities, as amended, remain unchanged. The New Credit Facilities contain, among other things, various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include, without limitation, certain limitations on transactions with affiliates, liens, making investments, the incurrence of debt, sales of assets, and changes in business. The financial covenants contained in the New Credit Facilities include a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants of the New Credit Facilities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, we made prepayments of $175.0 million toward the reduction of the First Lien Credit Facility. Of this amount, $115.0 million and $30.0 million were paid from proceeds from the Facet and Dia Real divestitures, respectively, and $30.0 million was paid from our operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance under the New Credit Facilities was $277.2 million. In February and May 2006, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements totaling $200 million notional amount to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to the New Credit Facilities. The swap agreements had the economic effect of converting $200 million of our floating rate debt under the New Credit Facilities to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreements, we will pay the bank fixed base rates of 5.065% and 5.350%, respectively, and the bank will pay us floating rates based on three month LIBOR (5.371% and 5.364%, respectively, at December 31, 2006). We reflected the interest rate swap agreements on the consolidated balance sheet at a fair value of $62,000 at December 31, 2006, which was based upon the estimated amount we would pay upon settlement of the agreements, taking into account interest rates at December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $79,000 from the cash flow hedges, which is included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In September 2006, we entered into a forward exchange agreement with a bank to eliminate the potential impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the expected euro proceeds from the sale of Dia Real. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to sell 26.0 million at the forward rate (1.2837) and receive approximately $33.4 million on the settlement date. We reported the forward exchange agreement at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet until it was settled in October 2006. 25 In 2004, we completed the sale of $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024. We received proceeds, net of discount, of $83.2 million from the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated notes. We used the proceeds and proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of our direct to consumer pharmacy and supplies business to fund the repurchase of $120 million in aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Notes, which had an aggregate principal amount of $122 million, tendered in a tender offer. This repurchase resulted in a net cash payment of $136.5 million. In June 2004, we recorded a charge of $22.9 million, or $14.1 million, net of taxes, related to the repurchase of substantially all of the 11% Senior Notes. On April 27, 2005, we issued a notice of our intention to redeem our $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% convertible senior subordinated notes on May 27, 2005. In response to the redemption notice, all noteholders converted their notes into shares of the Companys common stock prior to the redemption date, and the Company issued approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock ($19.61 per share). In addition, the redemption also required us to make a make whole payment equal to the present value, as of the redemption date, of all remaining scheduled interest payments on the notes through May 1, 2009. We paid the noteholders the make whole payment totaling $15.5 million ($3.52 per share), which included $294,000 of accrued but unpaid interest. The make whole payment, excluding the accrued but unpaid interest, was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 84, Induced Conversion of Convertible Debt. Since the conversion was pursuant to the original conversion terms and no inducement was made to the noteholders, no loss was recognized with respect to the make whole payment, excluding the accrued but unpaid interest, or the shares issued. Proceeds received from participants under our stock purchase and stock option plans totaled $6.0 million, $7.3 million, and $6.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We believe that our cash, other liquid assets, operating cash flows and New Credit Facilities, taken together, will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations through the remainder of 2007. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. The following sets forth our future minimum payments required under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term debt obligations (1) $ 279,957 $ 4,069 $ 8,600 $ 238,791 $ 28,497 Capital lease obligations 144 127 17 Operating lease obligations 31,450 8,539 14,427 5,011 3,473 Other long term obligations 6,981 3,343 2,606 1,032 Acquisition obligations (2) 54,223 54,223 $ 372,755 $ 70,301 $ 25,650 $ 244,834 $ 31,970 (1) Does not include the interest expense associated with the long term debt obligations. (2) Discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities and below under Other Factors Affecting Liquidity. Principal and interest payments of $3.3 million and $21.9 million, respectively, under the New Credit Facilities are payable in 2007. Capital expenditures of approximately $19 million are estimated in 2007 as we continue to enhance our computer information systems. We have restricted funds of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2006, which represent amounts held in escrow related to customer contracts. Funds are held in interest bearing investment accounts. 26 As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K, except for our indemnification obligations related to potential breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the definitive agreements to sell Facet and Dia Real, which obligations are capped at $12.5 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Other Factors Affecting Liquidity In connection with our acquisitions of WinningHabits and Miavita, we are required to pay additional consideration in future periods, based upon the attainment of defined operating objectives of these businesses. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, we accrue contingent consideration obligations upon attainment of the objectives. Additionally, any such payments result in increases in goodwill. We currently estimate that the additional consideration pursuant to the terms of our earn out agreement for the WinningHabits acquisition is $32.2 million. The estimated additional consideration, which is included in Acquisition contingent consideration on the consolidated balance sheet, is based on the attainment of the operating objectives for the year ended December 31, 2006, and is subject to final audit. The final amount for WinningHabits will be payable in 2007. Also included in Acquisition contingent consideration" is $22.0 million of earn out consideration for the second earn out period ending March 31, 2007, for the Miavita acquisition. On November 6, 2006, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with the seller that effectively amends the terms of the original acquisition agreement to fix the amount payable for the second earn out period at $20 million plus 3.575 times net revenues from certain new customers between November 6, 2006, and March 31, 2007, provided that no payment is payable in respect of the second earn out period unless payments received from such new customers between November 6, 2006, and May 1, 2007, are at least $500,000. Goodwill was increased by $55.9 million at December 31, 2006, for the consideration paid during 2006 and the estimated additional consideration payable under the earn out agreements described above. Uncertainties Pursuant to the merger agreement under which we acquired CorSolutions, we are pursuing a claim before a contractually designated settlement accountant for certain post closing adjustments including a $4 million claim relating to a liability resulting from CorSolutions pre closing performance under a customer contract. We are also pursuing a related claim for fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment before the American Arbitration Association in Chicago, Illinois, seeking damages in an unspecified amount exceeding $4 million. There is no assurance that we will prevail in either of these proceedings. We are subject to various legal claims and actions incidental to our business and the businesses of our predecessors, including product liability claims and professional liability claims. We maintain insurance, including insurance covering professional and product liability claims, with customary deductible amounts. There can be no assurance, however, that (i) lawsuits will not be filed against us in the future, (ii) our prior experience with respect to the disposition of litigation is representative of the results that will occur in pending or future cases or (iii) adequate insurance coverage will be available at acceptable prices, if at all, for incidents arising or claims made in the future. There are no pending legal or governmental proceedings to which we are a party that we believe would, if adversely resolved, have a material adverse effect on us. For a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 27 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our most critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue Recognition and Allowances for Uncollectible Accounts. Our services are provided telephonically and, in some cases, in a patients home from care centers located throughout the United States. In addition, our services are provided through access to our online health and wellness based tools. Revenues are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts. Our services are paid for primarily on the basis of (i) monthly fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan, (ii) each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract, (iii) each member enrolled in our programs, (iv) fee for service, or (v) a fixed rate per case. Billings for certain services occur in advance of services being performed. Such amounts are recorded as Unearned revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. Such amounts are subsequently recognized as revenue as services are performed. Some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk (i.e., refundable) if our programs do not achieve certain financial cost savings and clinical performance criteria. Revenues subject to refund are not recognized if (i) sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements, or (ii) interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets. If either of these two conditions exists, we record the amounts as Unearned revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. If we do not meet performance levels by the end of the operations period under the contract, we are contractually obligated to refund some or all of the at risk fees. In 2006, revenues from continuing operations were derived from the following types of customers and third party payors: approximately 57% from health plans, 34% from employers, 7% from government payors and 2% from administrative services only (ASO) self insured employer clients. A significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources. Therefore, the collectibility of all of our accounts receivable varies based on payor mix, general economic conditions and other factors. A provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon our evaluation of current industry conditions, historical collection experience, recoveries of amounts previously provided, industry reimbursement trends and other relevant factors which, in the opinion of management, deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The evaluation is performed at each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level. While estimates and judgments are involved and factors impacting collectibility may change, management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts to be collected. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill arising from business combinations is accounted for under the provision of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and is not amortized. Our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2006, we reported goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at net carrying amounts of $500.8 million and $55.9 million, respectively. The total of $556.7 million represents approximately 78% of our total assets as of December 31, 2006. We review goodwill and identifiable intangibles for impairment annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing 28 for impairment, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units that have goodwill and indefinite life intangibles assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units based upon earnings multiples for similar precedent transactions as well as the present value of estimated future free cash flows. The approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future revenues and operating costs, appropriate discount rates and other variables. We base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Therefore, future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill and intangibles existed at December 31, 2006. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. The income tax expense (benefit) for continuing operations was $12.8 million, $2.7 million, and $(13.3) million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Reflected in each year were various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting. As of December 31, 2006, our remaining net operating loss carryforwards of $67.0 million, the tax effect of which is reflected as an asset on the balance sheet in the Deferred income taxes, will be available to offset future taxable income liabilities. Based on projections of taxable income in 2007 and future years, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced. Share Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions, as we formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, (APB), Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. Changes in assumptions as to the employee forfeitures assumptions, exercise dates and volatility could have a significant impact on the stock compensation fair value determinations. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates, and this disclosure, with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Recently Issued and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. In June 2006, the FASB published Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and 29 measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The effective date of this interpretation is January 1, 2007, the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the provisions of FIN 48 to determine its impact, if any, on our financial statements but presently anticipate that its adoption will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Fair Value Measurements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this new standard and have not concluded our analysis on the impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial position. Prior Year Misstatements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB No. 108). SAB No. 108 addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in current year financials. Under the provisions of SAB No. 108, a reporting entity must quantify and evaluate errors using a balance sheet approach and an income statement approach. After considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, if either approach results in a misstatement that is material, a reporting entitys financial statements must be adjusted. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $813,000, net of income taxes of $518,000, to our January 1, 2006 consolidated balance sheet. We identified two uncorrected misstatements for consideration under SAB 108, each of which was considered immaterial to our results of operations in any reporting period when using only the income statement approach we historically used to assess the materiality of unrecorded errors: 1. An unrecorded liability for drugs and supplies from a major vendor, which is included in Accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets, resulted from an accumulation of unrecorded costs over several periods prior to 2003. This misstatement was identified in 2003 The amount required at January 1, 2006, to correct the liability balance would result in a $600,000 charge to our results of operations in 2006. 2. During 2006, we discovered that our medical device inventory, which is included in Property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets, was overstated due to improper recording of disposed and lost medical devices and the related depreciation expense. The misstatement originated in 2003 and accumulated over subsequent periods. The amount required to correct the medical device inventory balance at January 1, 2006, would result in a $731,000 charge to our results of operations in 2006. Under the balance sheet approach and the income statement approach, or the dual approach, we determined that correcting the above misstatements would be material to our 2006 financial statements and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to our January 1, 2006, consolidated balance sheet upon our initial application of SAB 108. 30 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt. Our primary interest rate risk relates to the New Credit Facilities and our interest rate swap facilities. In February 2006 and May 2006, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $200 million with a bank under which we will pay the bank fixed base rates of interest of 5.065% and 5.350%, respectively, and the bank will pay us floating rates based on three month LIBOR (5.371% and 5.364%, respectively, at December 31, 2006). The agreements, which have a two year term, have the economic effect of converting a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Based upon the total amount outstanding at December 31, 2006, not covered by interest rate swaps, a hypothetical two percentage point increase in the interest rates for a duration of one year would result in additional interest expense of approximately $2 million. 31
