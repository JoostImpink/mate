Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Significant Trends and Developments in Our Business Outlook for 2007. We believe our target markets are stable; however, there appears to be some uncertainty as to the growth range, if any, for investment technology budgets or spending levels in 2007. For 2007, we expect total revenues to range between $358 million and $368 million and software license sales to range between $58 million and $64 million. Quarterly software license revenues will continue to be subject to normal quarter to quarter variability. We expect GAAP earnings per share to range from $0.54 to $0.65 per share, which includes a restructuring charge of approximately $3.7 million in first quarter 2007 primarily for termination benefits related to a workforce reduction in our product development group. We do not plan to provide quarter to quarter guidance during 2007. Summary of 2006 Results and Developments in Our Business. On July 5, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Manugistics Group, Inc. (Manugistics) for an estimated total cost of $258 million which includes the cash purchase price of $211 million plus $13 million in estimated direct costs of the acquisition and $34 million in estimated costs to exit certain activities of Manugistics (the Merger). Manugistics was a leading global provider of synchronized supply chain and revenue management solutions that enabled customers to achieve improved forecast and inventory accuracy and leverage industry leading pricing and yield management solutions to maximize profits while ensuring optimum supply for constantly changing demand. We believe the combination of the two companies creates a unique competitive position as no other software company is currently able to offer a similar breadth and depth of vertically focused solutions to the supply and demand chain market. In addition, there are cross selling opportunities for Manugistics advanced optimization solutions in our existing retail customer base and we believe Manugistics supply chain and revenue management solutions will enable us to significantly expand our presence with consumer goods manufacturers and wholesalers. See the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the transaction. 26 Table of Contents The Manugistics acquisition had a significant impact on our 2006 results. The following tables summarize the changes in the various components of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 with and without Manugistics.

To address this situation, we reorganized the regional sales management team during third quarter 2006 including the appointment of Mr. Thomas Dziersk to Senior Vice President of the Americas region. Mr. Dziersk has established a new team of sales managers to execute the changes that we feel are necessary to improve business development, sales force execution and the predictability of the sales performance in the region. Although it may take several quarters to experience the complete impact of these changes, we do have a growing pipeline of larger software deals ( $1.0 million) in this region and we have achieved sequential improvements in software sales performance from our core JDA products in third and fourth quarter 2006 of 24% and 22%, respectively. The Americas is our largest region and as a result, we believe the anticipated increase in software license sales performance of both the core JDA and Manugistics applications in the region will be a key driver of our overall success in 2007. The European region generally performed below our expectations in 2006; however the region achieved sequential improvement in software sales performance in fourth quarter 2006. Sales management has stabilized in the region and we believe the accuracy of the software forecast has significantly improved. The quality and opportunities in the sales pipeline continues to grow and we have begun to experience increased activity with larger Tier One companies. We currently anticipate improved software sales performance in the European region during 2007. The Asia/Pacific region performed significantly below our expectations in the first and fourth quarter of 2006. We do not believe this is an indicator of a negative trend or a decline in our competitive position as the region has historically experienced large fluctuations in its quarterly software sales performance. The sales pipeline in the region continues to grow due in part to the rapid expansion of our business in India which resulted in three significant software license deals during 2006. We also believe the Chinese market will provide meaningful opportunities for software companies in 2007. We intend to focus on processes, similar to those being implemented in the Americas and European regions, which will improve the predictability and timing of software license deals in the Asia/Pacific region. A key driver for exploiting market opportunities in 2007 will be our ability to achieve a consistent awareness and support for our general solutions strategy. We are aggressively working to build partnerships with leading industry analysts and systems integrators to support our strategy. In addition, we will continue to develop a network of value added reseller (VAR) relationships during 2007 to promote and support our solutions in each geographic region. We have also initiated a number of VAR relationships in certain countries where we do not want to go to market directly. As of December 31, 2006 we had 219 employees in the sales and marketing function, compared to 138 at December 31, 2005, including quota carrying sales representatives and related sales management of 66 and 28 Table of Contents 65, respectively. We currently plan to increase our investment in the sales and marketing organization during 2007 to continue improvement in our sales coverage and execution. As part of this initiative, we are rebuilding the sales force dedicated to the Manufacturing and Distribution reportable business segment and will develop a program to more effectively communicate the value proposition of the combined JDA and Manugistics solutions offering to this large and important portion of our customer base. Maintenance services revenues increased $42.9 million or 50% in 2006 compared to 2005 with $41.9 million of the increase related to the acquisition of Manugistics. Despite strong retention rates, growth in new maintenance services revenues on our core JDA applications has been hindered by lower software sales and the suspension of revenue recognition of more than $1.0 million in maintenance revenues related to certain customer specific support issues, including the discontinuance of the PRO application. We believe software license revenues will remain volatile and although new software sales are still the key indicator of business growth, we do not believe they will be the primary determinant of our future profitability as we expect maintenance services to be the largest source of revenues and operating margin for the combined Company in the near term. With the acquisition of Manugistics, the combined Company now has an annual recurring maintenance base of over $170 million and have historically realized a retention rate of approximately 95% in our installed customer base. The strength of our maintenance services revenue stream should improve the predictability of our annual operating results and our overall profitability. Maintenance services margins were 75% in 2006 compared to 74% in 2005. Maintenance services margins were positively impacted in 2006 by the cost synergies and increased maintenance services revenue from the acquisition of Manugistics, offset in part by the suspension of revenue recognition on more than $1.0 million in maintenance revenues related to certain customer specific support issues, including the discontinuance of the PRO application. Maintenance costs increased $9.1 million or 40% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a 28% increase in average headcount resulting from the acquisition of Manugistics and the transfer of product development resources to our customer support organization to support the move of certain of our legacy products to the Customer Directed Development (CDD) organization structure. Maintenance costs in 2006 also include $487,000 in charges recorded in connection with the resolution of certain customer specific support issues. As of December 31, 2006, we had 246 employees in our customer support function, including 48 added through the acquisition of Manugistics, compared to 175 at December 31, 2005. We currently plan to add supplemental resources to this function in 2007 and expect our maintenance services margins to remain in the range of 75% to 76% in 2007. Service revenues, which include consulting services, hosting services, training revenues, net revenues from our hardware reseller business and reimbursed expenses, increased $28.3 million or 40% in 2006 compared to 2005 with $24.6 million of the increase related to the acquisition of Manugistics. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, service revenues increased $3.7 million or 5% in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to larger ongoing projects in the Americas. Our global utilization rate was 53% in 2006 compared to 48% in 2005. Service revenues will continue to be volatile on a monthly basis as we assimilate the Manugistics consulting organization and overcome the lag effect of lower software sales in 2006. Service revenues were also impacted by a $1.2 million or 36% decrease in hosting revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the loss of a large customer as a result of their merger. Consolidated service margins, which include consulting and the other service revenues referred to above, increased to 24% in 2006 from 20% in 2005, primarily as a result of the higher revenue volume. As of December 31, 2006, we had 498 employees in our services organization, including 231 added through the acquisition of Manugistics, compared to 311 at December 31, 2005. We believe it will take several more quarters to realize the full synergies of the combined services organization. In addition, service margins will be impacted in the first half of 2007 by certain large acquired Manugistics engagements that generate realized rates which are below our historical billing rates. As a result, we expect consolidated service margins to remain in the low 20% range in the first half of 2007. In January 2007, we announced that our future product offerings would be standardized on the Manugistics WebWORKS supply chain planning and optimization architectural platform which is based on the Java J2EE technology platform. Branded the JDA Enterprise Architecture, the new platform is the next evolution of the WebWORKS foundation and it will serve as the strategic platform upon which we will integrate and extend our 29 Table of Contents existing applications. Over the past five years, we have pursued a strategy for delivering our solutions as a fully integrated suite, utilizing Microsoft .NET products and technologies to develop and manage the execution of the application programs. The decision to change our product development direction was made in order to (i) standardize our applications on a stable platform that has been successfully implemented at over 100 major customers and offers improved scalability, (ii) eliminate parallel development efforts and provide improved focus on incremental functionality for future development activities, (iii) reduce our annual investment in new product development, which has ranged from 31% to 38% of product revenues over the past three years and (iv) improve the ability of our sales force to position a technology platform that is proven and available now compared to a platform which was still evolving. In connection with this decision, we reduced our workforce by nearly 120 FTE in first quarter 2007, primarily in our product development function in Scottsdale, Arizona, and will record a restructuring charge of approximately $3.7 million for termination benefits. We expect this workforce reduction will result in incremental annualized cost synergies of more than $15 million in 2007 compared to our post merger run rate in the second half of 2006. While Java J2EE will be our primary server technology platform, we will continue to leverage our existing investment in Microsoft technologies as appropriate. The Enterprise Planning application will not initially be impacted by our decision to standardize on the new architecture and we will continue to market it on the existing .NET Platform for the foreseeable future. We did however announce in fourth quarter 2006 that we would no longer market the PRO application and would use the Manugistics NetWORKS Demand and Fulfillment applications as our primary fulfillment solution. We intend to make additional enhancements to the NetWORKS Demand and Fulfillment applications to incorporate certain features and functionality that existed in PRO. We have met with each of our existing PRO customers to discuss their migration to the NetWORKS Demand and Fulfillment applications which is being made available under our Investment Protection Program. We will continue to market, support and enhance the Advanced Warehouse Replenishment by E3 and Advanced Store Replenishment by E3 applications. We recorded $1.8 million in charges in fourth quarter 2006 related to the discontinuance of PRO. In addition, we recorded an impairment loss of $200,000 on our E3 trademarks in fourth quarter 2006 due primarily to the discontinuance of PRO as it was originally intended to be the next generation product for the E3 applications. As of December 31, 2006, we had 538 employees in the product development function, including 269 added through the acquisition of Manugistics, compared to 289 at December 31, 2005. Approximately 200 developers added through the acquisition of Manugistics are located in India. The December 31, 2006 headcount was reduced by approximately 100 associates in January 2007. We believe general and administrative expenses in 2007 will approximate the annualized general and administrative expense level in the second half of 2006, exclusive of any significant change in our bad debt experience in 2007. We recorded restructuring charges of $6.2 million in 2006 primarily related to the consolidation of existing JDA offices in the United Kingdom into the Manugistics office facility in Bracknell. The charges consist primarily of relocation bonuses for those who agreed to relocate and termination benefits paid to employees who chose not to relocate. Our Board of Directors approved a special Manugistics Integration Incentive Plan (Integration Plan) in third quarter 2006. The Integration Plan provides for up to 510,939 contingently issuable restricted stock units with a fair value of approximately $8.5 million to executive officers and certain other members our of management team if we are able to successfully integrate the Manugistics acquisition and achieve a defined performance threshold goal in 2007. A partial pro rata issuance of restricted stock units will be made if we achieve a minimum performance threshold. The restricted stock units, if any, will be issued after the announcement of our 2007 financial results in January 2008 and will vest 50% upon the date of issuance with the remaining 50% vesting ratably over a 24 month period. No compensation expense was recognized in 2006 related to the Integration Plan. The Companys performance against the defined performance threshold goal will be evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout 2007 and stock based compensation recognized over the requisite service period that runs from August 18, 2006 (the date of board approval) through January 2010 pursuant to the guidance in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). If we achieve the defined performance threshold goal we would expect to recognize approximately 50% or approximately $4.2 million of the award as stock based compensation in 2007. 30 Table of Contents On February 6, 2007, the Board of Directors approved a 2007 cash incentive bonus plan (Incentive Plan) for our executive officers. The Incentive Plan provides for $2.6 million in targeted cash bonuses, payable quarterly, based upon defined annualized operational performance goals. A partial pro rata cash bonus will be paid if we achieve a minimum annualized performance threshold. This is no cap on the maximum amount the executives can receive if the Company exceeds the defined annualized operational and software performance goals. Our Financial Position Post Manugistics Acquisition. We had working capital of $41.1 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $119.0 million at December 31, 2005. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006 were $53.6 million, a decrease of $57.9 million from the $111.5 million reported at December 31, 2005. The decrease in working capital and cash and marketable securities resulted primarily from the $72.9 million in total cash expended to acquire Manugistics Group, Inc. (see Acquisition of Manugistics, Inc.) and the utilization of $35 million in excess cash balances in third quarter 2006 to repay a portion of the term loans entered into in connection with this acquisition, offset in part by $50 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to funds affiliated with Thoma Cressey Bravo Equity Partners (Thoma Cressey Bravo). Repayment of the $35 million in long term borrowings will result in a savings of nearly $2.7 million in annual interest charges. Net accounts receivable were $79.5 million or 81 days sales outstanding (DSO) at December 31, 2006 compared to $42.4 million or 69 DSO at December 31, 2005. This increase results primarily from slower than normal payment cycles for our customers and the transition of personnel in our global collections during fourth quarter 2006. Cash flow from operations was $15.4 million in 2006 compared to $20.5 million in 2005. The decrease in cash flow from operations in 2006 is due primarily to a $7.4 million decrease in net income which includes a $6.4 million reduction in other income (expense), net. We incurred net interest expense of $3.8 million in 2006, which includes $6.5 million of interest expense on $175 million in aggregate term loans entered into to finance the acquisition of Manugistics and $1.1 million in amortization of loan fees, offset by $3.9 million of interest income and other, net compared to interest income and other, net of $2.6 million in 2005 which consisted primarily of interest income and investment gains. Operating cash flow in 2006 was also negatively impacted by a $4.2 million larger net increase in accounts receivable due to increases in customer payment cycles subsequent to the acquisition of Manugistics and the payment of aged payables acquired in the Manugistics transaction. The decreases in operating cash flow in 2006 were offset in part by a $5.1 million larger decrease in deferred tax assets and a $3.1 million charge for the change in the fair value of a preferred stock conversion feature. We expect cash flow from operations to be positive in 2007. We believe our cash position is sufficient to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future and we will continue to use excess cash flow to retire the remaining long term borrowings. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and certain gross margin data expressed as a percentage of software license revenue, maintenance services revenue, product revenues or services revenues, as appropriate: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 REVENUES: Software licenses 18 % 27 % 27 % Maintenance services 46 40 37 Product revenues 64 67 64 Consulting services 33 30 33 Reimbursed expenses 3 3 3 Service revenues 36 33 36 Total revenues 100 100 100 COST OF REVENUES: Cost of software licenses 1 1 1 Amortization of acquired software technology 2 2 3 Cost of maintenance services 11 11 9 Cost of product revenues 14 14 13 Cost of consulting services 24 23 24 Reimbursed expenses 3 3 3 Cost of service revenues 27 26 27 Total cost of revenues 41 40 40 GROSS PROFIT 59 60 60 OPERATING EXPENSES: Product development 20 21 24 Sales and marketing 18 19 21 General and administrative 13 12 11 Amortization of intangibles 3 2 2 Restructuring charges and adjustments to acquisition related reserves 2 1 3 Loss on impairment of goodwill 4 Loss on impairment of trademarks 1 Total operating expenses 56 59 62 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) 3 1 (2 ) Interest expense and amortization of loan fees (3 ) Interest income and other, net 1 1 1 Change in fair value of Series B Preferred Stock conversion feature (1 ) Net gain on acquisition breakup fee 1 INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES 2 Income tax (provision) benefit (1 ) 1 1 NET INCOME % 2 % 1 % Gross margin on software licenses 96 % 97 % 96 % Gross margin on maintenance services 75 % 74 % 75 % Gross margin on product revenues 78 % 80 % 80 % Gross margin on service revenues 24 % 20 % 23 % 32 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a comparison of selected financial information, expressed as a percentage change between 2006 and 2005, and between 2005 and 2004.

Retail. Software license revenues in this reportable business segment, which include $4.2 million in software license revenues from the Manugistics product lines, decreased 38% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, software license revenues in this reportable business segment decreased 44% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a decrease in the number of large transactions of $1.0 million and a 44% decrease in average selling price on such transactions. We had six large transactions of $1.0 million in 2006, including one involving Manugistics product lines, compared to nine large transactions of $1.0 million in 2005 which included one unusually large multi million dollar transaction with multiple Transaction Systems and SDO Solutions. Software license revenues in this reportable business segment were also impacted in 2006 by a decrease in software license transactions of LT$1.0 million with new customers and a decrease in follow on sales to existing customers in the Americas and Europe regions of approximately $4.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively compared to 2005. Manufacturing & Distribution. Software license revenues in this reportable business segment, which include $5.4 million in software license revenues from the Manugistics product lines, increased 51% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, software license revenues in this reportable business segment increased 8% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in follow on sales to existing customers that expanded the scope of existing licenses. Services Industries. The increase in software license revenues in this reportable business segment in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted entirely from sales of SDO Solutions to customers of the Revenue Management business acquired from Manugistics. The majority of the software revenue in this reportable business segment is subject to contract accounting and the benefit of revenue deferred prior to the Manugistics acquisition was not brought forward in purchase accounting as there were no additional delivery obligations. Regional Results. Software license revenues in the Americas region, which include $4.9 million in software license revenues from the Manugistics product lines, decreased 28% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, software license revenues in the Americas region decreased 40% in 2006 compared to 2005 which is primarily due to a lack of sales management, business development and sales force execution. In addition, software license revenues in 2005 included one unusually large multi million dollar transaction that included multiple Transaction Systems and SDO Solutions. Software license revenues in the Europe region, which include $4.3 million in software license revenues from the Manugistics product lines, increased 18% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, software license revenues in the Europe region decreased 18% primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in follow on sales to existing customers that expand the scope of existing licenses. The Europe region recorded two large transactions $1.0 million in 2006, one of which involved the Manugistics product lines, compared to one large transaction $1.0 million in 2005. Software license revenues in the Asia/Pacific region, which include $608,000 in software license revenues from the Manugistics product lines, decreased 9% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, software license revenues in the Asia/Pacific region decreased 19% primarily due to a 35% decrease in average sales price on new software license deals $1.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005. We recorded two large transactions of $1.0 million in the Asia/Pacific region in 2006 compared to two large transaction of $1.0 million in 2005. Maintenance Services. Maintenance services revenues, which include $21 million from the acquired Manugistics product lines, increased 50% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, maintenance services revenues increased 1% in 2006 compared to 2005. Despite historically strong retention rates of approximately 95%, growth in new maintenance services revenues on our core JDA applications has been hindered by lower software sales and the suspension of revenue recognition of more than $1.0 million in maintenance revenues related to certain customer specific support issues, including the discontinuance of the PRO application. 35 Table of Contents Service Revenues Service revenues, which include $24.6 million from the Manugistics product lines, increased 40% in 2006 compared to 2005. Before considering the impact of Manugistics, services revenues increased 5% in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to ongoing projects in the Americas including a large multi product implementation in the United States, which has now been completed, offset in part by flat to lower utilization rates and consulting services revenue in the Europe and Asia/Pacific regions. Service revenues were also impacted by a $1.2 million or 36% decrease in hosting revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the loss of a large customer as a result of their merger. Net revenues from our hardware reseller business decreased 56% to $533,000 in 2006 compared to $1.2 million in 2005. Fixed bid consulting services work represented 14% of total consulting services revenue in 2006 and 2005. Cost of Product Revenues Cost of Software Licenses. The increase in cost of software licenses in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted primarily from sales of certain of our Transaction Systems and SDO Solutions that incorporate functionality from third party software providers and require the payment of royalties, including $730,000 related to the Manugistics product lines, offset in part by a $350,000 decrease in costs associated with certain third party software database applications that we resell. Amortization of Acquired Software Technology. The increase in amortization of acquired software technology in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted primarily from amortization of the software technology acquired in the Manugistics acquisition. Cost of Maintenance Services. The increase in cost of maintenance services in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from a 28% increase in average headcount, due to the acquisition of Manugistics and the transfer of product development resources to our customer support organization to support the move of certain of our legacy products to the Customer Directed Development (CDD) organization structure, a $2.6 million increase in third party maintenance royalties primarily related to the Manugistics revenue streams, $487,000 in charges associated with the resolution of certain customer specific support issues and a $368,000 increase in outside contractor costs. Cost of Service Revenues The increase in cost of service revenues in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from a 27% increase in average services headcount, primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics during the second half, as well as a $5.7 million increase in outside contractor costs for ongoing consulting projects in the United States and a $3.2 million increase in reimbursed expenses, offset in part by the deferral of $1.0 million in consulting costs on a large Manugistics implementation project in the United States for which revenue recognition has been deferred, and a $586,000 decrease in training costs. Gross Profit The increase in gross profit dollars in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted primarily from the $76.3 million revenue contribution from Manugistics and higher service revenue margins offset in part by related increases in average headcount in our customer support and consulting services organizations to support the larger revenue streams. The gross margin percentage decreased to 58% in 2006 compared to 60% in 2005. This decrease results from the lower mix of software license revenues. The increase in service revenue margins in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted primarily from the 40% increase in service revenues, the deferral of $1.0 million in consulting costs on a large Manugistics implementation project in the United States for which revenue recognition has been deferred, and a $586,000 decrease in training costs, offset in part by a 27% increase in average services headcount primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics and a $5.7 million increase in outside contractor costs for ongoing consulting projects in the United States. 36 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, increased $27.4 million, or 25% in 2006 compared to 2005, and represented 50% and 52% of total revenues in each period, respectively. The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from an increase in average headcount from the acquisition of Manugistics, an increase in costs related to the use of outside contractors to assist in development activities, higher travel, training, legal and accounting costs related to the integration of Manugistics and a decrease in capitalized costs related to the development of internal systems, offset in part by lower incentive compensation. Product Development. The increase in product development expense in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from a 36% increase in average product development headcount, primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics, which resulted in higher salaries, benefits, travel, training and occupancy costs, a $793,000 increase in outside contractor costs to assist in the development of our solutions, offset in part by the transfer of product development resources to the customer support organization to support the move of certain of our legacy products to the CDD organization structure, a $513,000 decrease in incentive compensation as a result of lower software license revenues and a $499,000 decrease in vendor cost reimbursements on joint development projects. Product development expense in 2006 includes $871,000 compared to $600,000 in 2005, in charges related to the settlement of certain customer specific situations, including $488,000 in charges related to the discontinuance of PRO during fourth quarter 2006. Sales and Marketing. The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from a 41% increase in average headcount, primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics, which resulted in higher salaries, benefits, travel and marketing costs, offset in part by a $1.9 million decrease in incentive compensation due to lower software license revenues and a $400,000 decrease in utilization of consulting services employees to assist in presales activities. General and Administrative. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from a 23% increase in average headcount, primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics, which resulted in higher salaries, benefits, travel and training costs. We also had a $926,000 increase in legal and accounting costs as a result of the larger combined company, a $670,000 decrease in capitalized costs associated with our major system initiatives, and a $376,000 increase in stock based compensation for new hires in the management team. General and administrative expense in 2006 includes a bad debt provision of $1.4 million, of which $1.0 million is related to the discontinuance of PRO, compared to $1.6 million in 2005. Amortization of Intangibles. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2006 compared to 2005 results primarily from $5.5 million in amortization on the customer list intangibles recorded in the acquisition of Manugistics. Restructuring Charges. We recorded restructuring charges of $6.2 million in 2006, including $5.7 million in charges during the second half of 2006 for relocation bonuses and termination benefits related to the consolidation of existing JDA offices in the United Kingdom into the Manugistics office facility in Bracknell and a $521,000 charge in second quarter 2006 for termination benefits related to the restructure and elimination of certain accounting and administrative positions in Europe and Canada. We recorded restructuring charges of $2.4 million in 2005 to complete the restructuring initiatives contemplated in our 2005 Operating Plan. The charge in 2005 included $2.0 million in termination benefits for 44 FTE and $423,000 for net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain vacated facilities. Loss on Impairment of Trademarks. The Company announced in fourth quarter 2006 that it would continue to support the E3 product suite through the end of 2012. With this announcement, the E3 trademarks were tested for impairment and we recorded an impairment loss of $200,000 in fourth quarter 2006. We also recorded an impairment loss of $200,000 during fourth quarter 2005 on the E3 trademarks primarily due to a lower software revenue forecast and a flattening of the projected revenue growth curve. Operating Income Operating income increased to $7.3 million in 2006 compared to $1.9 million in 2005. A 29% increase in total revenues, resulting primarily from the $76.3 million revenue contribution from Manugistics and a $9.7 million 37 Table of Contents decrease in impairment charges, offset by the costs and expenses related to a 31% increase in average headcount including 677 employees added through the acquisition of Manugistics, the $6.4 million increase in amortization of intangibles and a $3.8 million increase in restructuring charges. Operating income in our Retail reportable business segment increased to $27.4 million in 2006 compared to $25.4 million in 2005. The increase in operating income in this reportable business segment resulted primarily from a $15.6 million increase in service revenues, a $9.7 million decrease in impairment charges and a 5% decrease in allocated sales and marketing costs based upon the pro rata share of software sales that came from this reportable business segment, offset in part by a $10.4 million decrease in product revenues, an $8.7 million increase in maintenance and service revenue costs and an 18% increase in product development costs. Operating income in our Manufacturing and Distribution reportable business segment increased to $31.9 million in 2006 compared to $9.6 million in 2005. The increase resulted primarily from increases in product and service revenues of $41.3 million and $9.5 million, respectively, offset in part by a $13.7 million increase in maintenance and service revenue costs due to the Manugistics acquisition, a 93% increase in allocated sales and marketing costs based upon the pro rata share of software sales that came from this reportable business segment, and a 42% increase in product development costs. All customers in the Services Industries reportable business segment are new to JDA and represent the former Revenue Management business acquired from Manugistics. This reportable business segment incurred an initial loss of $1.5 million in 2006 on total revenues of $5.6 million, total costs of revenue of $5.1 million, and $2.0 million in operating costs for product development and sales and marketing activities. The combined operating income reported in the reportable business segments excludes $50.6 million and $33.1 million of general and administrative expenses and other charges in 2006 and 2005, respectively, that are not directly identified with a particular reportable business segment and which management does not consider in evaluating the operating income (loss) of the reportable business segments. Other Income (Expense) During 2006 we incurred interest expense of $6.5 million on aggregate term loan obligations and $1.1 million in amortization of loan origination fees. To finance the acquisition of Manugistics and the repayment of their debt obligations, we entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of lenders that provided for $175 million in aggregate term loans with interest payable quarterly at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) + 2.25%. Prior to this transaction, we had no long term debt obligations. We recorded interest income and other, net of $3.9 million in 2006 compared to $2.8 million in 2005. During 2005 and the first half of 2006, we invested our excess cash balances in a variety of financial instruments including bank time deposits and variable and fixed rate obligations of the U.S. Government and it agencies, states, municipalities, commercial paper and corporate bonds with interest rates generally ranging between 2% and 5%. We liquidated substantially all of our investments through sales or maturities in second quarter 2006 to generate cash to complete the acquisition of Manugistics on July 5, 2006. During the second half of 2006 our excess cash balances were primarily invested in money market accounts. Change in Fair Value of Series B Preferred Stock Conversion Feature We recorded non cash charges of $3.1 million in 2006 to reflect the change in the fair value of the conversion feature in the $50 million of Series B Preferred Stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Manugistics. The primary factor causing the change in the fair value of the conversion feature was the increase in our stock price from the close of acquisition on July 5, 2006 to October 20, 2006. The conversion feature as originally drafted was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) and accordingly has been accounted for separately from the Series B Preferred Stock. On the date of issuance, we recorded a $10.9 million liability for the estimated fair value of the conversion feature and reduced the face value of the Series B Preferred Stock to $39.1 million. The language in the agreement describing the conversion feature did not reflect the original intent of the parties, and as a result, we filed a Certificate of Correction with the State of Delaware on October 20, 38 Table of Contents 2006 to correct the definition of the cash redemption price in the original Designation of Rights, Preferences, Privileges and Restrictions of the Series B Preferred Stock. After this change, the conversion feature no longer met the bifurcation criteria in SFAS No. 133. See the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of this transaction. Income Tax Provision A summary of the income tax (provision) benefit recorded in 2006 and 2005 is as follows: 2006 2005 Income before income tax provision $ 421 $ 4,502 Effective tax rate 213.8 % 30.8 % Income tax provision at effective tax rate (900 ) (1,385 ) Less discrete tax item benefits: Changes in estimate 33 3,524 Change in foreign statutory tax rates 319 Total discrete tax item benefits 33 3,843 Income tax (provision) benefit $ (867 ) $ 2,458 The income tax (provision) benefit for 2006 and 2005 takes into account the source of taxable income, domestically by state and internationally by country, and available income tax credits, but does not include the tax benefits realized from the employee stock options exercised during these years of $330,000 and $807,000, respectively. These tax benefits reduce our income tax liabilities and are included as an increase to additional paid in capital. The effective tax rate is higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the non deductibility of the expense for the change in fair value of the conversion feature of the redeemable Series B Preferred Stock. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Product Revenues Software Licenses. Retail. Software license revenues in this reportable business segment were flat in 2005 compared to 2004 and included nine new software license deals of $1.0 million in 2005 compared to eight in 2004. The Retail reportable business segment includes all software license revenues that were previously reported under the Retail Enterprise Systems and In Store Systems reportable business segments. We reorganized our reportable business segments in third quarter 2006 in connection with the acquisition of Manugistics and have restated the previously reported results for 2005 and 2004 in order to conform to the current presentation. Manufacturing & Distribution. The decrease in software license revenues in this reportable business segment in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from a decrease in sales of SDO Solutions, offset in part by an increase in license revenues from Marketplace Replenishment, our collaborative specific CPFR solution which is sold on a subscription basis. The Manufacturing & Distribution reportable business segment includes all software license revenues that were previously reported under the Collaborative Solutions reportable business segment. We reorganized our reportable business segments in third quarter 2006 in connection with the acquisition of Manugistics and have restated the previously reported results for 2005 and 2004 in order to conform to the current presentation. Regional Results. The Americas region accounted for $40.4 million of our software license revenues in 2005 compared to $43.4 million in 2004. Software license revenues in the Americas region decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an 11% decrease in software license revenues from Retail reportable business segment offset in part by a 13% increase in software license revenues from the Manufacturing & Distribution reportable business segment. The Americas software license revenues in 2005 include six new multi product software license deals of $1.0 million that contain various combinations of Transaction Systems and SDO Solutions applications compared to eight in 2004. The 2004 results in this region included software revenues from two particularly large 39 Table of Contents milestone based transactions involving Transaction Systems. The European region accounted for $12.1 million of our software license revenues in 2005 compared to $10.7 million in 2004. Software license revenues in our European region increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 45% increase in software license revenues from the Retail reportable business segment offset in part by a 38% decrease in software license revenues from the Manufacturing & Distribution reportable business segment. The European region had one new software license deal of $1.0 million in 2005 compared to none in 2004. The Asia/Pacific region accounted for $6.0 million of our software license revenues in 2005 compared to $5.1 million in 2004. Software license revenues in the Asia/Pacific region increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to one large software license deal of $1.0 million in 2005 in the Retail reportable business segment. Maintenance Services. The increase in maintenance services revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 is due primarily to new software license sales of SDO Solutions in 2005 that increased our installed customer base and approximately $872,000 of favorable foreign exchange effects. Service Revenues The decrease in service revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from decreases in implementation services for SDO Solutions, particularly in the European region where several large projects were wrapping up or had been completed. Hosting revenues increased 10% to $3.5 million in 2005 from $3.2 million in 2004. Net revenues from our hardware reseller business decreased 52% to $1.2 million in 2005 from $2.6 million in 2004 which included an unusually large hardware transaction to one customer. Fixed bid consulting services work represented 14% of total consulting services revenue in 2005 compared to 16% in 2004. Cost of Product Revenues Cost of Software Licenses. The decrease in cost of software licenses in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from a lower number of transactions that involved the resale of third party software applications. Amortization of Acquired Software Technology. The decrease in amortization of acquired software technology in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from the software technology related to the Arthur Suite of products that was fully amortized. Cost of Maintenance Services. The increase in cost of maintenance services in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from an 8% increase in average maintenance services headcount to support a larger installed customer base and the Customer Directed Development organization structure, higher incentive compensation due to the Companys improved operating performance and an increase in outside contractor costs, offset in part by a $523,000 decrease in the utilization of consulting services employees in customer support activities. Cost of Service Revenues The decrease in cost of service revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from a 20% decrease in average services headcount, offset in part by a $1.0 million increase in outside contractor costs for ongoing consulting projects rather than hire FTE positions, higher incentive compensation due to the Companys improved operating performance, and a $2.2 million decrease in cost transfers out to other departments for consulting services and training employees who were used to support presales, product development and customer support activities. Gross Profit Gross profit dollars and our gross profit percentage were flat in 2005 compared to 2004. An increase in maintenance services revenue was substantially offset by the increase in average headcount in our customer support organization and lower service revenue margins. The decrease in service revenue margins in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from lower revenues, higher incentive compensation due to the Companys improved overall operating performance, a $2.2 million decrease in cost transfers to other departments for consulting services employees who were used to support presales, 40 Table of Contents product development and customer support activities and a $1.0 million increase in outside contractor costs for ongoing consulting projects rather than hire FTE positions, offset in part by the decrease in average services headcount. Excluding the net revenues from the hardware reseller business, service margins were 18% in 2005 compared to 21% in 2004. Operating Expenses Operating expenses, excluding amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and adjustments to acquisition related reserves, and losses on impairment of goodwill and trademarks, decreased 9% in 2005 compared to 2004, and represented 52% and 57% of total revenues in each year, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses included a decrease in salaries, benefits and travel costs related to the headcount reductions in the restructuring initiatives undertaken during fourth quarter 2004 and first half 2005, lower outside legal fees due to reduced litigation activities, lower marketing costs, lower accounting costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, and lower insurance costs. These reductions were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to the Companys improved operating performance, a higher bad debt provision and increased use of outside contractors to assist in development activities. Product Development. The decrease in product development expense in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from a 23% decrease in average product development headcount from our restructuring initiatives and a $733,000 decrease in travel and recruiting costs, offset in part by a $462,000 increase in outside contractor costs to assist in new development activities and a $381,000 increase in incentive compensation due to the Companys improved operating performance. Sales and Marketing. The decrease in sales and marketing expense in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from a 15% decrease in average sales and marketing headcount from our restructuring initiatives, a $930,000 decrease in utilization of consulting services employees in presales activities, a $1.1 million decrease in travel costs, and a $793,000 reduction in marketing costs due to a cutback in marketing brochures and trade show activities, offset in part by a $1.6 million increase in incentive compensation. General and Administrative. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from a $1.6 million higher bad debt provision, a $654,000 increase in foreign exchange losses, a $296,000 increase in executive recruitment and relocation costs, and a $289,000 increase in incentive compensation due to our improved operating performance. These increases were offset in part by a $767,000 decrease in outside legal fees due to reduced litigation activities, a $794,000 decrease in accounting costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, a $453,000 decrease in insurance costs, and a 6% decrease in average general and administrative headcount from our restructuring initiatives. Amortization of Intangibles. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from our decision to accelerate the amortization on certain customer list intangibles related to applications acquired from Vista Software Solutions, Inc. that are being discontinued. Restructuring Charge and Adjustments to Acquisition Related Reserves. We recorded restructuring charges of $2.5 million during 2005 to complete the restructuring initiatives contemplated in our 2005 Operating Plan. These charges, which primarily include termination benefits and net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain vacated facilities, were in addition to the $3.1 million restructuring charge recorded in fourth quarter 2004 which also included termination benefits and the negotiated buyout or net rentals remaining under existing operating leases on certain facilities that were vacated by December 31, 2004. Loss on Impairment of Goodwill. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.7 million in fourth quarter 2005 related to write off all goodwill previously reported under the In Store Systems reportable business segment. Loss on Impairment of Trademarks. We recorded impairment losses of $200,000 and $1.1 million during fourth quarter 2005 and 2004, respectively on the trademarks acquired from E3. The impairment losses resulted primarily from a lower software revenue forecast and a flattening of the projected revenue growth curve, rather than a change in legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that would limit the useful lives of the E3 trademarks. 41 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) We produced operating income of $1.9 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $3.8 million in 2004. The increase in operating income is due to the 4% increase in product revenues and the cost reductions that have resulted from our restructuring initiatives, offset in part by an 8% decrease in service revenues in 2005 compared to 2004, a $4.9 million increase in total incentive compensation due to the Companys improved operating performance and a $1.6 million higher bad debt provision. Operating income in our Retail reportable business segment increased to $25.4 million in 2005 compared to $19.5 million in 2004. The increase in operating income in this business segment resulted primarily from a 21% decrease in product development costs, a 12% decrease in allocated sales and marketing costs based upon the pro rata share of software sales that came from this business segment and a $1.3 million increase in total revenues, offset in part by a $9.0 million increase in impairment charges. Operating income in our Manufacturing and Distribution reportable business segment decreased to $9.6 million in 2005 compared to $11.1 million in 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from a $2.3 million decrease in total revenues, offset in part by an 8% decrease in allocated sales and marketing costs based upon the pro rata share of software sales that came from this business segment and a 2% decrease in product development costs. Income Tax Benefits A summary of the income tax benefits recorded in 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 2005 2004 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 4,502 $ (444 ) Effective tax rate 30.8 % 66.7 % Income tax (provision) benefit at effective tax rate (1,385 ) 296 Discrete tax item benefits: Changes in estimate 3,524 1,628 Change in foreign statutory tax rates 319 Audit settlements 529 Total discrete tax item benefits 3,843 2,157 Income tax benefit $ 2,458 $ 2,453 During 2005, we recorded an extra territorial income tax exclusion (ETI) benefit of $722,000 related to 2005 and ETI benefits of approximately $2.3 million for the years 2002 through 2004 which are included as a change in estimate in the 2005 summary of discrete tax item benefits. The income tax benefits in 2005 and 2004 take into account the source of taxable income, domestically by state and internationally by country, and available income tax credits, and do not include the tax benefits realized from the employee stock options exercised during these years of $807,000 and $126,000, respectively. These tax benefits reduce our income tax liabilities and are included as an increase to additional paid in capital. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had working capital of $41.1 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $119.0 million at December 31, 2005. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006 were $53.6 million, a decrease of $57.9 million from the $111.5 million reported at December 31, 2005. The decrease in working capital and cash and marketable securities resulted primarily from the $72.9 million in total cash expended to acquire Manugistics Group, Inc. (see Acquisition of Manugistics, Inc.) and the utilization of $35 million in excess cash balances in third quarter 2006 to repay a portion of the term loans entered into in connection with this acquisition, offset in part by $50 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock to funds affiliated with Thoma Cressey Equity Partners. Repayment of the $35 million in long term borrowings will result in a savings of nearly $2.7 million in annual interest charges. 42 Table of Contents Net accounts receivable were $79.5 million or 81 days sales outstanding (DSO) at December 31, 2006 compared to $42.4 million or 69 DSO at December 31, 2005. This increase results primarily from increases in customer payment cycles subsequent to the acquisition of Manugistics and the transition of personnel in our global collections during fourth quarter 2006. DSOs may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including the percentage of total revenues that comes from software license sales which typically have installment payment terms, seasonality, shifts in customer buying patterns or industry mix of our customers, the timing of annual maintenance renewals, lengthened contractual payment terms in response to competitive pressures, the underlying mix of products and services, and the geographic concentration of revenues. Operating activities provided cash of $15.4 million in 2006 compared to $20.5 million in 2005. The principle sources of our cash flow from operations are typically net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and bad debt provisions, collections on accounts receivable, and increases in deferred maintenance revenue. The decrease in cash flow from operations in 2006 is due primarily to a $7.4 million decrease in net income which includes a $6.4 million reduction in net other income (expense). We incurred net interest expense of $3.8 million in 2006, which includes $6.5 million of interest expense on $175 million in aggregate term loans entered into to finance the acquisition of Manugistics and $1.1 million in amortization of loan fees, offset by $3.9 million of interest income and other, net compared to interest income and other, net of $2.6 million in 2005 which consisted primarily of interest income and investment gains. Operating cash flow in 2006 was also negatively impacted by a $4.2 million larger net increase in accounts receivable due to increases in customer payment cycles subsequent to the acquisition of Manugistics and the payment of aged payables acquired in the Manugistics transaction. The decreases in operating cash flow in 2006 were offset in part by a $5.1 million larger decrease in deferred tax assets and a $3.1 million charge for the change in the fair value of a preferred stock conversion feature. Investing activities utilized cash of $45.8 million in 2006 and $8.0 million in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 includes $72.9 million in net cash expended to acquire Manugistics, $8.0 million in capital expenditures and $6.7 million in payment of direct costs related to the Manugistics acquisition, offset in part by $40.4 million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities to generate cash to complete the acquisition of Manugistics and the final $1.2 million payment received on the promissory note receivable from Silvon Software, Inc. Net cash utilized by investing activities in 2005 includes $4.9 million in capital expenditures and $4.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities, offset in part by $1.5 million in payments received on the Silvon note. Financing activities provided cash of $11.1 million in 2006 and utilized cash of $1.4 million in 2005. Financing activities in 2006 include proceeds of $168.4 million from term loan borrowings, which are net of nearly $6.6 million of loan origination and other administrative fees, and the issuance of $50 million in Series B Preferred Stock to Thoma Cressey Bravo in connection with the acquisition of Manugistics (see Acquisition of Manugistics Group, Inc. under Significant Trends and Developments in Our Business). We used the proceeds from the term loan borrowings and the Thoma Cressey Bravo equity investment, together with the companies combined cash balances at closing, to fund the cash obligations of the acquisition and to retire approximately $174 million of Manugistics existing debt which included 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes that were scheduled to mature in 2007 and various capital lease obligations. We utilized $35 million in excess cash balances in third quarter 2006 to repay a portion of the term loans. The term loan borrowings contain certain financial and other covenants. We were in compliance with the financial and other covenants at December 31, 2006. Financing activities in 2005 include the repurchase of 747,500 shares of our common stock for $8.7 million under a stock repurchase program (see Treasury Stock Purchases). The activity in both periods includes proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans. Changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign operations had the effect of increasing cash by $1.6 million in 2006 and decreasing cash by $1.4 million in 2005. The change in 2006 is due to the weakening of the US Dollar against major foreign currencies including the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. We use derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts, to manage a majority of the short term foreign currency exchange exposure associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not hedge the potential impact of foreign currency exposure on our ongoing revenues and expenses from foreign operations. The exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We do not enter 43 Table of Contents into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than 90 days, and are not designated as hedging instruments under Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). Forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recognized in other income, net, offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Treasury Stock Purchases. In January 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices during a one year period ended January 26, 2006. The program was adopted as part of our revised approach to equity compensation, which emphasizes performance based awards to employees and open market stock repurchases by the Company designed to mitigate or eliminate dilution from future employee and director equity based incentives. During 2005, we repurchased a total of 747,500 shares of our common stock for $8.7 million under this program. There were no purchases under this program during 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 14,656 shares tendered by employees for the payment of applicable statutory withholding taxes on the issuance of restricted shares under the 2005 Performance Incentive Plan. These shares were repurchased for $189,000 at prices ranging from $11.19 to $17.00 per share. Accelerated Vesting of Options. On February 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the immediate vesting of all unvested stock options previously awarded to employees, officers and directors. The accelerated options were issued under our 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Outside Director Stock Option Plan and 1998 Non statutory Stock Option Plan. The closing market price per share of our common stock on February 15, 2005 was $11.85 and the exercise prices of the approximately 1.4 million in unvested options on that date ranged from $8.50 to $28.20. The exercise of vested stock options would increase our working capital. Contractual Obligations. The following summarizes scheduled principal maturities and interest on long term debt and our operating lease obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total LT 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Scheduled principal maturities and interest on long term debt $ 208,479 $ 14,082 $ 24,572 $ 24,003 $ 145,822 Operating lease obligations $ 79,541 $ 16,031 $ 23,477 $ 22,076 $ 17,957 Contracted sublease rentals $ (15,970 ) $ (3,624 ) $ (5,896 ) $ (5,646 ) $ (804 ) Long term debt includes $139.5 million in borrowings under term loan agreements which are due in quarterly installments of $437,500 through July 5, 2013, with the remaining balance due at maturity, and $1.5 million in convertible subordinated notes assumed in the Manugistics acquisition that are scheduled to mature in November 2007. In addition to the scheduled maturities, the term loan agreements also require additional mandatory repayments on the term loans of 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined, beginning with the fiscal year which commences January 1, 2007. The scheduled principal maturities in the table above exclude any potential mandatory repayments of 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined. Interest is payable quarterly on the term loans at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) + 2.25%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 28, 2006 to fix LIBOR at 5.365% on $140 million, or 80% of the aggregate term loans. We have structured the interest rate swap with decreasing notional amounts to match the expected pay down of the debt. The notional value of the interest rate swap was $126.9 million at December 31, 2006 and represented approximately 91% of the aggregate term loan balance. The interest rate swap agreement is effective through October 5, 2009 and has been designated a cash flow hedge derivative. Operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases with minimum or remaining lease terms at December 31, 2006. We lease office space in the Americas for 15 regional sales and support offices across the United States, Canada and Latin America, and for 15 other international sales and support offices located in major cities throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, and Japan. The leases are primarily non cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from one to 20 years that expire at various dates 44 Table of Contents through the year 2018. None of the leases contain contingent rental payments; however, certain of the leases contain scheduled rent increases and renewal options. We expect that in the normal course of business most of these leases will be renewed or that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms as needed. In addition, we lease various computers, telephone systems, automobiles, and office equipment under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms ranging from 12 to 75 months. Certain of the equipment leases contain renewal options and we expect that in the normal course of business some or all of these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. All capital lease obligations assumed in the Manugistics acquisition were paid during third quarter 2006. We believe our cash and cash equivalents and net cash provided from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we intend to use excess cash flow to accelerate the payment of the remaining outstanding debt. A major component of our positive cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable and the generation of cash earnings. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The only change in our critical accounting policies during 2006 is the addition of an interest rate risk management and accounting policy related to cash flow hedging derivatives (see Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10 K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations. In addition, our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties. We follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue; however, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy. We license software primarily under non cancelable agreements and provide related services, including consulting, training and customer support. We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position 97 2 (SOP 97 2), Software Revenue Recognition, as amended and interpreted by Statement of Position 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, with respect to certain transactions, as well as Technical Practice Aids issued from time to time by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, that provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Software license revenue is generally recognized using the residual method when: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and a license agreement has been signed; Delivery, which is typically FOB shipping point, is complete; Fees are fixed and determinable and there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance; Collection is considered probable; and Vendor specific evidence of fair value (VSOE) exists for all undelivered elements. Our customer arrangements typically contain multiple elements that include software, options for future purchases of software products not previously licensed to the customer, maintenance, consulting and training services. The fees from these arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on VSOE. Under the residual method, if an arrangement contains an undelivered element, the VSOE of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered. If we are unable to determine VSOE for any undelivered element included in an arrangement, we will defer revenue recognition until all 45 Table of Contents elements have been delivered. In addition, if a software license contains milestones, customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right, the software revenue is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone or upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right. Maintenance services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements. Maintenance services typically include on line support, access to our Solution Centers via telephone and web interfaces, comprehensive error diagnosis and correction, and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements, when and if we make them generally available. Maintenance services are generally billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month, or billed on an annual basis with the revenue initially deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period. VSOE for maintenance services is the price customers will be required to pay when it is sold separately, which is typically the renewal rate. Consulting and training services are separately priced and stated in our arrangements, are generally available from a number of suppliers, and are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products. Consulting services include project management, system planning, design and implementation, customer configurations, and training. These services are generally billed bi weekly on an hourly basis or pursuant to the terms of a fixed price contract. Consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed. Under fixed price contracts, including milestone based arrangements, consulting services revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion. Training revenues are included in consulting revenues in the Companys consolidated statements of income and are recognized once the training services are provided. VSOE for consulting and training services is based upon the hourly or per class rates charged when those services are sold separately. We offer hosting services on certain of our software products under arrangements in which the end users do not take possession of the software. Revenues from hosting services are included in consulting revenues, billed monthly and recognized as the services are provided. Revenues from our hardware reseller business are also included in consulting revenues, reported net (i.e., the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to the supplier) pursuant to EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and recognized upon shipment of the hardware. Customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element. We do not sell or ship our software, nor recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable. Payments for our software licenses are typically due within twelve months from the date of delivery. Although infrequent, where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery, revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Accounts Receivable. Consistent with industry practice and to be competitive in the retail software marketplace, we typically provide payment terms on most software license sales. Software licenses are generally due within twelve months from the date of delivery. Customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before we enter into a new arrangement that provides for software and or a service element. We do not sell or ship our software, nor recognize any revenue unless we believe that collection is probable in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 8 in Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For those customers who are not credit worthy, we require prepayment of the software license fee or a letter of credit before we will ship our software. We have a history of collecting software payments when they come due without providing refunds or concessions. Consulting services are generally billed bi weekly and maintenance services are billed annually or monthly. For those customers who are significantly delinquent or whose credit deteriorates, we typically put the account on hold and do not recognize any further services revenue, and may as appropriate withdraw support and or our implementation staff until the situation has been resolved. We do not have significant billing or collection problems. We review each past due account and provide specific reserves based upon the information we gather from various sources including our customers, subsequent cash receipts, consulting services project teams, members of each regions management, and credit rating services such as Dun and Bradstreet. Although infrequent and unpredictable, from time to time certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy, and we have been required to refund the pre petition 46 Table of Contents amounts collected and settle for less than the face value of their remaining receivable pursuant to a bankruptcy court order. In these situations, as soon as it becomes probable that the net realizable value of the receivable is impaired, we provide reserves on the receivable. In addition, we monitor economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which we operate to determine if general reserves or adjustments to our credit policy in a region are appropriate for deteriorating conditions that may impact the net realizable value of our receivables. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Our business combinations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and potential impairment charges we may incur. The determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), requires management to make estimates of future revenues, customer retention rates and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired, using a two step process that compares a weighted average of the fair value of future cash flows under the Discounted Cash Flow Method of the Income Approach and the Guideline Company Method to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to our reporting units. No indications of impairment have been identified in 2006 with respect to our Retail, Manufacturing and Distribution and Services Industries reportable business segments. We recorded an impairment charge of $9.7 million in fourth quarter 2005 to write off all goodwill allocated to the In Store Systems reportable business segment due to the historical performance of our point of sale systems being below expectations and the slower projected growth rate for these applications in our operating plans. The impairment charge is reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income under the caption Loss on impairment of goodwill. Customer lists are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 8 years to 13 years. The values allocated to customer list intangibles are based on the projected economic life of each acquired customer base, using historical turnover rates and discussions with the management of the acquired companies. We also obtain third party appraisals to support our allocation of the purchase price to these assets. We estimate the economic lives of these assets using the historical life experiences of the acquired companies as well as our historical experience with similar customer accounts for products that we have developed internally. We review customer attrition rates for each significant acquired customer group on annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances change, to ensure the rate of attrition is not increasing and if revisions to the estimated economic lives are required. Acquired software technology is capitalized if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software. Amortization of software technology is reported as a cost of product revenues in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86). Software technology is amortized on a product by product basis with the amortization recorded for each product being the greater of the amount computed using (a) the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future revenue for that product, or (b) the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on. The estimated economic lives of our acquired software technology range from 5 years to 15 years. Trademarks have historically been assigned indefinite useful lives and tested annually for impairment using the Relief from Royalty Method of the Income Approach. The premise of this valuation method is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit (cash receipts less cash outlays) to be received over the life of the asset and assumes that in lieu of ownership, a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class. Through December 31, 2005, substantially all of our trademarks were acquired in connection with the acquisition of E3 Corporation (E3). We recorded impairment losses of $200,000 and $1.1 million on the E3 trademarks in 2005 and 2004, respectively due primarily to a lower software revenue forecast and a flattening of the projected 47 Table of Contents revenue growth curve. The Company announced in fourth quarter 2006 that it would continue to support the E3 product suite through the end of 2012. With this announcement, the E3 trademarks were tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and we recorded an additional impairment loss of $200,000 in fourth quarter 2006. At December 31, 2006, the E3 trademarks have a remaining balance of $1.8 million that has been classified as an amortized intangible asset and which will be amortized prospectively on a straight line basis over an estimated remaining useful life of 3 years. The impairment charges are reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income under the caption Loss on impairment of trademark. We recorded $3.0 million in trademarks in connection with the acquisition of Manugistics Group, Inc. The Manugistics trademarks are being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of 3 years. Product Development. The costs to develop new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. We consider technological feasibility to have occurred when all planning, designing, coding and testing have been completed according to design specifications. Once technological feasibility is established, any additional costs would be capitalized. We believe our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility, and accordingly, no costs have been capitalized. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. We follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances when recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered likely. We exercise significant judgment in determining our income tax provision due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, we obtain an external review of our income tax provision by an independent tax advisor prior to the filing of our quarterly and annual reports. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final tax determination could differ from our recorded income tax provision and accruals. In such case, we would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. These adjustments could have a material impact on our income tax provision and our net income for that period. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income tax uncertainties and defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also prescribes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions and requires expanded disclosures at each interim and annual reporting period. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and will require that differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption are to be accounted for as cumulative effect adjustments to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007; however, we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Stock Based Compensation. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, share based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements will now include (i) compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated under the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation 48 Table of Contents (SFAS No. 123), and (ii) compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 under the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We do not expect that our outstanding stock options will result in a significant compensation expense charge as all stock options were fully vested prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Stock options are no longer used for share based compensation. A 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (2005 Incentive Plan) was approved by our stockholders on May 16, 2005 that provides for the issuance of up to 1,847,000 shares of common stock to employees, consultants and directors under stock purchase rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, performance units and deferred compensation awards. With the adoption of the 2005 Incentive Plan, we terminated our 1996 Stock Option Plan, 1996 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan and 1998 Non Statutory Stock Option Plans except for those provisions necessary to administer the outstanding options. The 2005 Incentive Plan contains certain restrictions that limit the number of shares that may be issued and cash awarded under each type of award, including a limitation that awards granted in any given year can be no more than one percent (1%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the last day of the preceding fiscal year. Awards granted under the 2005 Incentive Plan will be in such form as the Compensation Committee shall from time to time establish and may or may not be subject to vesting conditions based on the satisfaction of service requirements or other conditions, restrictions or performance criteria including the Companys achievement of annual operating goals. Restricted stock and restricted stock units may also be granted as a component of an incentive package offered to new employees or to existing employees based on performance or in connection with a promotion, and will generally vest over a three year period, commencing at the date of grant. We measure the fair value of awards under the 2005 Incentive Plan based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. The awards are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the straight line method. Our Board of Directors approved a special Manugistics Integration Incentive Plan (Integration Plan) in third quarter 2006. The Integration Plan provides for up to 510,939 contingently issuable restricted stock units with a fair value of approximately $8.5 million to executive officers and certain other members of our management team if we are able to successfully integrate the Manugistics acquisition and achieve a defined performance threshold goal in 2007. A partial pro rata issuance of restricted stock units will be made if we achieve a minimum performance threshold. The restricted stock units, if any, will be issued after the announcement of our 2007 financial results in January 2008 and will vest 50% upon the date of issuance with the remaining 50% vesting ratably over a 24 month period. No compensation expense was recognized in 2006 related to the Integration Plan. The Companys performance against the defined performance threshold goal will be evaluated on a quarterly basis throughout 2007 and stock based compensation recognized over the requisite service period that runs from August 18, 2006 (the date of board approval) through January 2010 pursuant to the guidance in SFAS No. 123(R). If we achieve the defined performance threshold goal we would expect to recognize approximately 50% or approximately $4.2 million of the award as stock based compensation in 2007. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) we accounted for share based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. As permitted under SFAS No. 123, we elected to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and account for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, we recognized no share based compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and shares issued under employee stock purchase plans. We provided pro forma disclosure on a quarterly and annual basis of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per common share for stock option grants and shares issued under employee stock purchase plans as if the fair value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and 49 Table of Contents Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). We use derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts, to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. The exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than 90 days, and are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our long term debt which provides for quarterly interest payments at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) + 2.25%. To manage this risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 28, 2006 to fix LIBOR at 5.365% on $140 million, or 80% of the aggregate term loans. We have structured the interest rate swap with decreasing notional amounts to match the expected pay down of the debt. The notional value of the interest rate swap was $126.9 million at December 31, 2006 and represented approximately 91% of the aggregate term loan balance. The interest rate swap agreement is effective through October 5, 2009 and has been designated a cash flow hedge derivative. SFAS No. 133 requires derivatives to be recorded as either an asset or a liability in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as highly effective and qualify as a cash flow hedge are deferred and recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (i.e., that quarterly payment of interest). When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the resulting gain or loss is reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the underlying transaction (i.e., interest expense). A change in the fair value of an ineffective portion of a hedging derivative is recognized immediately in earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge derivative on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2006, the hedge was highly effective and we have recorded a net unrealized gain of $235,000 in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In connection with the acquisition of Manugistics, we issued 50,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) for $50 million in cash. The Series B Preferred Stock included a scheduled redemption right that allowed any holder to demand a redemption of all or any part of their shares after September 6, 2013 at a cash redemption price equal to the greater of (a) a $1,000 per share liquidation value or (b) the fair market value of the common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. The conversion feature as originally drafted was considered an embedded derivative under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, and accordingly had been accounted for separately from the Series B Preferred Stock. On the date of issuance, we recorded a $10.9 million liability for the estimated fair value of the conversion feature and reduced the face value of the Series B Preferred Stock to $39.1 million. The language in the agreement describing the conversion feature did not reflect the original intent of the parties, and as a result, we filed a Certificate of Correction with the State of Delaware on October 20, 2006 to correct the definition of cash redemption price and limit the cash redemption to the $1,000 per share liquidation value. After this change, the conversion feature no longer met the bifurcation criteria in SFAS No. 133. We recorded non cash charges of $3.1 million in 2006 to reflect the increase in the fair value of the conversion feature from July 5, 2006 to October 20, 2006. The increase in the fair value of the conversion feature resulted from the increase in our stock price during this period of time. We reclassified the $14 million estimated fair value of the conversion feature on October 20, 2006 to additional paid in capital pursuant to the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06 7, Issuers Accounting for a Previously Bifurcated Conversion Option in a Convertible Debt Instrument When the Conversion Option No Longer Meets the Bifurcation Criteria in FASB Statement No. 133 (EITF Issue No. 06 7). 50 Table of Contents Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of unrecorded misstatements. SAB 108 requires that a company use both a balance sheet approach (iron curtain) and an income statement approach (rollover) when quantifying misstatement amounts. The determination that an error is material in a current year that includes prior year effects may result in the need to correct prior year financial statements, even if the misstatement in the prior year or years is considered immaterial. When companies correct prior year financial statements for immaterial errors, SAB 108 does not require previously filed reports to be amended. Rather, such correction may be made the next time the company files prior year financial statements. SAB is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). Among other requirements, SFAS No. 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also expands disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective beginning the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective beginning the first fiscal years that begins after November 15, 2007. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and whether we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In addition, our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, and other regulations and restrictions. Foreign currency exchange rates. Our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies. International revenues represented 40% of our total revenues in 2006 as compared to 41% and 40% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled 28% of consolidated net assets at December 31, 2006, as compared to 20% at December 31, 2005. The increase in identifiable assets at December 31, 2006 in our foreign operations results primarily from the acquisition of Manugistics and the allocation of related intangible asset values. Our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business. We operate outside the United States primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe, Asia/Pacific, Canada and Latin America. We have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such, foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. Changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $2.0 million in 2006, an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $1.0 million in 2005 and an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of $2.5 million in 2004. Foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the U.S. Dollar, and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure. We prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net working capital as of December 31, 2006 to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates. Based upon the results of these analyses, a 10% adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the December 31, 2006 rates would result in a currency translation loss of $2.2 million before tax. 51 Table of Contents We use derivative financial instruments, primarily forward exchange contracts, to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. The exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than 90 days, and are not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recognized in other income offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2006, we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of $20.7 million and an associated net forward contract liability of $22,000. At December 31, 2005, we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of $6.4 million and an associated net forward contract receivable of $117,000. The net forward contract receivables or liabilities are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities as appropriate. The notional value represents the amount of foreign currencies to be purchased or sold at maturity and does not represent our exposure on these contracts. We prepared sensitivity analyses of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2006. Based on the results of these analyses, a 10% adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the December 31, 2006 rates would result in a net forward contract liability of $1.6 million that would increase the underlying currency transaction loss on our net foreign assets. We recorded foreign currency exchange contract losses of $316,000 and $464,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively and a foreign currency exchange contract gain of $190,000 in 2004. Interest rates. We have historically invested our cash in a variety of financial instruments denominated in U.S. dollars, including bank time deposits and variable and fixed rate obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies, states, municipalities, commercial paper and corporate bonds, and have classified all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank. Interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption Other income (expense), net. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have suffered a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates. We hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading. During second quarter of 2006, we liquidated substantially all of our investments through sales or maturities in order to generate cash to complete the acquisition of Manugistics on July 5, 2006. There were no securities held as of December 31, 2006 and our excess cash balances were primarily invested in money market accounts. We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our long term debt which provides for quarterly interest payments at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) + 2.25%. To manage this risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 28, 2006 to fix LIBOR at 5.365% on $140 million, or 80% of the aggregate term loans. We have structured the interest rate swap with decreasing notional amounts to match the expected pay down of the debt. The notional value of the interest rate swap was $126.9 million at December 31, 2006 and represented approximately 91% of the aggregate term loan balance. The interest rate swap agreement is effective through October 5, 2009 and has been designated a cash flow hedge derivative. SFAS No. 133 requires derivatives to be recorded as either an asset or a liability in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as highly effective and qualify as a cash flow hedge are deferred and recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction (i.e., that quarterly payment of interest). When the hedged transaction affects earnings, gains or losses are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the underlying transaction (i.e., interest expense). A change in the fair value of an ineffective portion of a hedging derivative is recognized immediately in earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge derivative on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2006, the hedge was highly effective and we have recorded a net unrealized gain of $235,000 in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 52 Table of Contents
