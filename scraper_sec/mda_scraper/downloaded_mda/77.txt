ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION INCLUDES CERTAIN FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MATERIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS, SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND THE COMPANYS OTHER REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Arrow is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of clinically advanced, disposable catheters, heart assist devices and related products for critical and cardiac care. The Company markets its products to physicians and hospitals through a combination of direct selling, independent distributors and group purchasing organizations. Within each hospital, marketing efforts are targeted to those physicians, including critical care specialists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists, nephrologists, emergency and trauma physicians, electrophysiologists and surgeons, most likely to use the Companys products. The Companys largest geographical markets are the United States, Europe and Asia. The Companys revenues are generated from sales of its products, less certain related charges, discounts, returns and other allowances. The Companys costs and expenses consist of costs of goods sold; research and development expense; selling, general and administration expense; and other expenses (income). Costs of goods sold consist principally of costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of the Companys products. Research and development expense consists principally of expenses incurred with respect to the Companys internal research, development and engineering activities to introduce new products to market and enhance its existing products, payments for third party research and development activities, and acquired in process research and development costs arising from the Companys acquisition activities. Selling, general and administrative expense consists principally of costs associated with the Companys marketing and sales efforts and administrative operations and commitments, including costs incurred in connection with the Companys efforts to enhance its good manufacturing practices and quality system compliance as part of its Project Operational Excellence program. Other expenses (income) consists principally of interest expense on the Companys outstanding indebtedness, interest income and other items, such as foreign currency exchange gains and losses, which may impact the comparability of the Companys results of operations between periods. The Companys ability to grow its net income largely depends upon generating increased sales of its products, particularly its higher margin products, and further improving its operating efficiency. The Companys sales growth is driven by its development and marketing of clinically advanced new products and enhancements to its existing products to increase their effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability, as well as to expand the clinical applications for which their use is appropriate. In this regard, the Companys research and development efforts are currently focused on the following five core product areas: central venous access, regional anesthesia, cardiac assist, dialysis access and hemodynamic monitoring. The Company also anticipates generating higher sales through selective acquisitions of new businesses, products and technologies that complement its existing product lines, as it has done from time to time in the past. The Company is focused on improving operating margins and sales growth by increasing the efficiency and overall capacity of its manufacturing operations and better aligning production facilities with key geographic markets, while maintaining effective cost containment programs. In this regard, in April 2004, the Company initiated a multi year capital investment plan to increase its worldwide manufacturing capacity to better meet customer demand and rationalize its production operations, which entailed the construction and acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities in Zdar, Czech Republic and Chihuahua, Mexico, which were completed in fiscal 2006. Production began at the new Chihuahua facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and at the new Zdar facility in August 2006. The Company has also consolidated certain of its U.S. based manufacturing operations, and is improving its production technology by investing in new, state of the art manufacturing equipment and processes, the installation of which is ongoing, and implementing enhanced good manufacturing practices and compliance procedures to achieve the highest practicable levels of product quality assurance, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, all as part of its Project Operational Excellence program. As a result of these initiatives, the Company has made significant progress in enhancing product quality, reducing customer backorders and improving manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness. In addition, in recent years, in an effort to better serve customers in key geographic markets and more closely tailor its direct marketing activities to a larger and more global base of customers, the Company has made selective acquisitions of some of its distributors and or distribution rights in key U.S. and international markets, thereby increasing the percentage of its sales generated by its direct sales force and improving gross profit margins. In furtherance of this strategy, in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired certain assets of its former United Kingdom distributor, Kimal PLC, associated with the sale of its products in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Company faces substantial competition from a number of other companies in the market for catheters and related medical devices and equipment, ranging from small start up enterprises to companies that are larger than Arrow with greater financial and other resources. In addition, in response to concern about the rising costs of health care, U.S. hospitals and physicians are placing increasing emphasis on cost effectiveness in the selection of products to perform medical procedures. The increased emphasis on health care cost containment has resulted in reduced growth in demand for certain of the Companys products in markets in the U.S. in which Arrow has a leading market share, and protecting that market share has affected the Companys pricing in some instances. The Company also continues to face pricing pressures in certain product lines in both European and Japanese markets as governments strive to curtail increases in health care costs. Despite these pressures, the Company has been able to retain its position as a leader in the central venous catheter market, primarily through concerted efforts to establish and maintain high customer loyalty and a strong, recognizable brand name among hospitals and physicians. The Company believes that its comprehensive manufacturing capability, which as described above has been recently expanded, enables it to expedite the development and market introduction of new (18) products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies, thereby helping to ensure a more effective response to competitive pricing in an environment where its ability to increase prices is limited. Managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an examination of the material changes in the Companys operating results for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, and its operating results for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity and capital resources, focusing primarily on material changes in operating, investing and financing activities as depicted in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report, information on the Companys available credit facilities and a summary of its outstanding contractual obligations. Finally, MD&A provides information on critical accounting policies and estimates and new accounting standards. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents for the three years ended August 31, 2006 Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales and the period to period percentage changes in the dollar amounts of the respective line items. Period to Period Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 Year ended August 31, vs. vs. vs. 2006 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 6.0 % 4.9 % 13.9 % Gross profit 49.2 47.1 51.8 10.8 (4.7) 18.0 Operating expenses: Research and development 5.7 6.5 7.0 (7.4) (2.3) 7.8 Selling, general and administrative 27.1 28.2 25.4 1.4 16.3 23.3 Restructuring charge 0.5 0.1 (89.5) 806.7 * Operating income 16.4 11.9 19.3 46.5 (35.5) 29.6 Other expenses (income), net (0.6) (0.2) 0.1 250.0 (199.9) (134.4) Income before income taxes 17.0 12.1 19.2 49.5 (33.9) 23.9 Provision for income taxes 5.4 3.4 6.3 69.3 (43.2) 26.8 Net income 11.6 % 8.7 % 12.9 % 41.8 % (29.3) % 22.3 % *Not a meaningful comparison FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 NET SALES Net sales increased by $27.3 million, or 6.0%, to $481.6 million in fiscal 2006 from $454.3 million in fiscal 2005 due primarily to an increase in critical care product sales, as well as an increase in cardiac care product sales. This increase was offset in part by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact during fiscal 2006 as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the Company operates direct sales subsidiaries. This foreign exchange impact resulted in decreased sales for fiscal 2006 of $3.9 million. The following is a summary of the Companys sales by product platform: Sales by Product Platform (in millions) For the years ended August 31, 2006 August 31, 2005 Central venous catheters $250.7 $235.2 Specialty catheters 152.9 142.3 Non Arrow distributed products 7.6 7.9 Subtotal critical care 411.2 385.4 Cardiac care 70.4 68.9 TOTAL $481.6 $454.3 (19) Sales of critical care products increased by 6.7% to $411.2 million from $385.4 million in fiscal 2005 due primarily to increased sales of central venous catheters and specialty catheters. Sales of central venous catheters increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to a continued increase in the number of hospitals that are purchasing the Companys procedure kits featuring its safety devices and ARROWg+ard(R) antiseptic surface treatments. Sales of specialty catheters increased in fiscal 2006 due to improved sales of arterial products, epidural products and peripheral nerve block products. Sales of cardiac care products increased by 2.2% to $70.4 million from $68.9 million in fiscal 2005 due primarily to increased sales of intra aortic balloon pumps offset in part by decreased sales of diagnostic products. Total Company U.S. sales increased by 5.0% to $291.4 million from $277.6 million in the prior year principally as a result of increased sales of central venous and specialty catheters. International sales increased by 7.6% to $190.2 million from $176.7 million in the prior year principally as a result of increased sales of central venous catheters, specialty catheters and intra aortic balloon pumps, offset in part by the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, as noted above. International sales represented 39.5% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to 38.9% in fiscal year 2005. The ARROWg+ard(R) conversion percentages, which are the number of units sold with the ARROWg+ard(R) antiseptic surface treatments as a percentage of the Companys total multilumen and hemodialysis unit sales, were 37% of total Company sales in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The ARROWg+ard(R) conversion percentages for the U.S. market increased to 66% in fiscal 2006 from 64% in the comparable prior year period. The safety device procedure kits conversion percentages, which are the number of units sold with the Companys procedure kits featuring its safety devices as a percentage of the total number of units sold of the Companys products that could potentially include safety device procedure kits, were 9% of total Company sales in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The safety device procedure kit conversion percentages for the U.S. market in fiscal 2006 increased to 19% from 17% in the comparable prior year period. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, as part of its ongoing efforts to meet physicians needs for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital setting, the Company began selling its new Maximal Barrier central venous access kit. Sales of this product have increased steadily since its introduction in January 2006. The Company plans to continue expanding its marketing program in support of this new product, and anticipates increased sales of this kit in the future on the basis of its benefits to patients and healthcare workers alike. PRODUCT RECALL As previously reported, on December 3, 2004 the Company announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all of its Neo[heart]PICC(R) 1.9 FR Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (the "NeoPICC Catheters") as a result of having received several reports of adverse events involving the utilization of the NeoPICC Catheters. The NeoPICC Catheter is part of the Companys Neo[heart]Care product line of catheters and related procedure kits for neonatal intensive care that it acquired from Klein Baker Medical, Inc. in March 2003. The Company cooperated with the FDA in conducting the voluntary recall. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a charge against net sales of $0.5 million representing its issued sales credits as of January 7, 2005 and an estimate for those sales credits yet to be issued relating to returned NeoPICC Catheters. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had issued sales credits totaling the full $0.5 million and does not anticipate the need to issue any additional credits. To address inspectional observations of the FDA and to facilitate the integration of its Neo[heart]Care manufacturing operations into its other existing facilities, in January 2005 the Company temporarily ceased the manufacture, shipment and sale of its entire Neo[heart]Care product line, including the NeoPICC Catheters, until it has completed the implementation of all corrective actions related to the FDAs inspections. The Company presently expects to submit a new 510(k) pre market notification to the FDA for a modified version of the NeoPICC Catheter during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and has decided to delay the resumption of production of the Neo[heart]Care product line, including the NeoPICC Catheters, until it has received FDA marketing clearance for these modifications. The Companys Neo[heart]Care product line sales were $7.6 million for all of fiscal 2004 and were $2.0 million in fiscal 2005, prior to the date it temporarily suspended all Neo[heart]Care product sales as described above. As of August 31, 2006, the Company is fully reserved for its inventories of NeoPICC Catheters. Inventories of other Neo[heart]Care products were approximately $1.3 million at August 31, 2006, which includes a $0.4 million reserve for potentially unusable inventory. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit increased by 10.8% to $236.8 million in fiscal 2006 from $213.8 million in fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased to 49.2% in fiscal 2006 compared to 47.1% in fiscal 2005. This increase in gross margin was due primarily to several factors, including: (1) the recording of a $12.4 million reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily for inventory components in excess of 36 months forecasted usage (as well as obsolete field service parts), consisting of $5.0 million of critical care product raw materials, semi finished and finished goods, $3.5 million of Hemosonic components and $3.9 million of IAB inventories, which was due primarily to a change in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 from an order point to a Materials Requirement Planning system and an analysis in greater detail of planned future usage as compared to inventory quantities on hand; as a result, the Company was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory; (2) the recording of a provision to cost of sales of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 for inventory and manufacturing equipment related to the Companys LionHeart Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) as a consequence of the Companys decision in April 2005 to discontinue the development, sales and marketing programs related to the LionHeart; (3) incremental retirement related expenses of $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 related to the Companys voluntary early retirement program; (4) a $2.1 million write off of manufacturing equipment no longer in use based on physical inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of the Companys worldwide production equipment; (5) lower margins realized in fiscal 2005 on the sale of inventories of products acquired as part of the Companys purchase of the net assets of AB Medica, the Companys former Italian distributor, in September 2004, as further discussed below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities"; (6) lower unfavorable inventory adjustments in fiscal 2006 resulting from the scrapping of returned goods and periodic cycle counting of (20) inventories; and (7) a positive impact on gross margin in fiscal 2006 resulting from the incremental sales generated in the United Kingdom and Ireland following the Companys purchase of certain assets of Kimal, its former distributor in the United Kingdom region, in April 2006, as further discussed below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities." These positive impacts on margin relative to the prior fiscal year were offset in part by: (1) a $3.5 million reduction in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for a correction of fixed asset lives related to manufacturing equipment in the Companys non U.S. facilities, as those lives were shorter than those prescribed by the Companys policy; (2) lower margins realized in fiscal 2006 on the sale of products acquired as part of the Companys purchase of certain assets of Kimal in April 2006; and (3) higher manufacturing costs recognized in fiscal 2006 associated with short term inefficiencies and the training of new employees in connection with the Companys manufacturing capital investment program. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses decreased by 7.4% to $27.5 million in fiscal 2006 from $29.7 million in fiscal 2005. This decrease in research and development spending was due primarily to decreased spending in fiscal 2006 on the Companys cardiac care product line, mostly attributable to the fact that there were no research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 relating to the Companys LionHeart LVAS as a result of its Board of Directors decision to discontinue the development, sales and marketing programs related to the LionHeart during the third quarter of fiscal 2005, whereas there was $4.8 million of LionHeart related spending in fiscal 2005. Offsetting this decrease was increased spending on the CorAideTM continuous flow ventricular assist system, the Companys joint research and development program with The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, as well as increased expenditures relating to regulatory compliance. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.7% in fiscal 2006 compared to 6.5% in fiscal 2005, but were only 5.5% in fiscal 2005 excluding LionHeart related spending. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.4% to $130.0 million in fiscal 2006 from $128.2 million in the comparable prior year period, and were 27.1% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2005. These expenses were impacted in fiscal 2006 by incremental expenses of $3.0 million for the cost of equity based compensation incurred as a result of the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123R in September 2005 and, in fiscal 2005, by $5.0 million of costs related to the Companys voluntary early retirement program, $2.0 million related to the settlement of a claim for indemnification related to a divested business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which the Company paid in November 2005, and a credit of $0.3 million related to the correction of fixed asset lives associated with the Companys foreign sales subsidiaries. There were also the following additional expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year: (1) $3.0 million related to the buildup of the Companys critical care sales force; (2) $1.1 million related to an increase in the Companys cost of providing medical insurance to its employees, for which the Company is self insured, due primarily to an increase in the number of large claims and employee participants; (3) $1.0 million related to the expansion of the Companys United Kingdom direct sales subsidiary following its acquisition of certain assets of Kimal in April 2006; (4) $1.0 million of amortization expense related primarily to the intangible assets included as part of the Kimal acquisition; (5) $0.9 million related to the Companys retired officers life insurance policies; and (6) $0.5 million related to legal costs associated with the Companys ongoing patent infringement lawsuits. These increases were offset in part by decreased spending related to various company wide programs, including decreased expenses of (1) $2.2 million related to the Companys Project Operational Excellence program and (2) $1.6 million related to the Companys assessment of its internal control over financial reporting. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Company recorded $0.2 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2006 compared to $1.9 million in fiscal 2005. The restructuring expense recorded in fiscal 2006 included a pre tax gain of $0.3 million from the sale of the Companys San Antonio, Texas facility and $0.3 million of expense related to a revision of the estimated loss associated with the Companys sublease of space formerly occupied by its European Distribution Center in Weesp, Netherlands. The restructuring charges in fiscal 2005 related primarily to severance payments associated with the Companys consolidation of operations at its Winston Salem, North Carolina and San Antonio, Texas facilities into other existing manufacturing facilities and severance, lease termination and other costs associated with the relocation of its European Distribution Center from Weesp, Netherlands to a more centralized European location in the Limberg region of Belgium. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities Multi Year Capital Investment Plan." OPERATING INCOME Principally due to the above factors, operating income increased 46.5% to $79.1 million in fiscal 2006 from $54.0 million in fiscal 2005. OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSES, NET Other (income) expenses, net, was $2.8 million of income in fiscal 2006 as compared to $0.8 million of income in fiscal 2005, due primarily to the Company earning a higher amount of interest in fiscal 2006 on its investments of cash balances. Aggregate foreign exchange losses were $0.2 million and $0.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Foreign currency contracts resulted in $0.9 million of gains in fiscal 2006 and less than $0.1 million of gains in fiscal 2005. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES As a result of the factors discussed above, income before income taxes increased in fiscal 2006 by 49.5% to $81.9 million from $54.8 million in fiscal 2005. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE The Companys effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 increased to 31.6% from 27.9% in fiscal 2005 due primarily to: (1) a reduction in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from a shift in the mix of earnings to the Czech Republic, which carries a lower tax rate due to a tax holiday effective through August 2006, as further discussed below; (2) more favorable fiscal 2005 research and development tax credits; (3) the completion of an intercompany intangible transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 related to the Companys European operations; and (4) a $1.7 million increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to the income tax provision to provide for deferred taxes related to temporary differences that will reverse upon the expiration of the Czech Republic tax (21) holiday and additional state income taxes. Partially offsetting these items that increased the Companys effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 were (1) a reduction in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 resulting from the Japanese tax assessment, as further discussed below, and (2) the establishment of a $1.4 million accrual in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for state income taxes primarily related to taxation of the Companys U.S. intangible holding company. The Company currently anticipates its effective tax rate to increase to 35.0% for fiscal 2007 due to a reduction in export tax credits, and it could increase to 36.5% if the U.S. Congress does not pass legislation renewing the research and development tax credit. U.S. TAX MATTERS On October 22, 2004, the President signed The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"). The Act included some of the most significant changes to corporate taxation since 1996 and, among other things, eliminates the Extra Territorial Income ("ETI") Exclusion deduction, a tax incentive that benefits U.S. companies to manufacture export products domestically, over a three year phase out period beginning in 2005. However, the phase out allowed the Company to obtain a significant percentage of the ETI benefit for fiscal 2005 and 2006 with a somewhat smaller benefit anticipated for fiscal 2007. The ETI will be totally phased out by the Companys 2008 fiscal year end. Additionally, the Act provides for a new tax deduction for U.S. domestic manufacturers beginning in the Companys fiscal year 2006. This new deduction begins at 3% of the Companys U.S. domestic manufacturing income for the Companys fiscal years 2006 and 2007, increasing to 6% for the Companys fiscal years 2008 to 2010 and achieves its maximum rate of 9% for the Companys fiscal years 2011 and beyond. While the Company is not yet able to make an exact calculation of the overall effect of these changes, management believes that the phased out repeal of the ETI benefit during 2005 and 2006 and the phase in of the new manufacturing deduction benefit from 2006 to 2011 should not have a material adverse effect on the Companys effective tax rate, although it believes that the net effect will be less of an income tax benefit to the Company for fiscal 2007 and beyond. CZECH REPUBLIC TAX HOLIDAY During fiscal 2006, the Companys effective income tax continued to reflect a benefit from a tax holiday in respect of the Companys Czech Republic operations. This tax holiday was in effect for a five year period, effective through August 2006, and was limited by the amount of capital permanently invested in the Czech Republic by way of property, plant and equipment purchased. This tax holiday expired in fiscal 2006 and the Company will cease to benefit from it in fiscal 2007. JAPANESE TAX ASSESSMENT In March 2004, the Company made a payment of $10.0 million to settle a tax assessment related to an ongoing Japanese Government tax audit of the Companys transfer pricing with its Japanese subsidiary. In order to recover a majority of this Japanese tax assessment, the Company initiated competent authority proceedings with the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the competent authority proceedings were completed and the Company recorded a favorable tax credit of $3.7 million in the income tax provision to reflect relief from a tax assessment related to transfer pricing between the U.S. and the Companys Japanese subsidiary for its fiscal years 1998 through 2004. NET INCOME Net income in fiscal 2006 increased 41.8% to $56.0 million from $39.5 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of net sales, net income represented 11.6% in fiscal 2006 compared to 8.7% in fiscal 2005. PER SHARE INFORMATION Basic earnings per common share were $1.25 in fiscal 2006, up 40.4%, or $0.36 per share, from $0.89 in fiscal 2005. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.24 in fiscal 2006, up 40.9%, or $0.36 per share, from $0.88 in fiscal 2005. Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used in computing basic earnings per common share increased to 44,766,759 in fiscal 2006 from 44,300,408 in fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of additional stock option exercises during fiscal 2006. Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used in computing diluted earnings per common share increased to 45,273,102 in fiscal 2006 from 45,007,881 in fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of additional stock option exercises during fiscal 2006 and an increase in potentially dilutive shares resulting from an increased average share price. (22) FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 NET SALES Net sales increased by $21.2 million, or 4.9%, to $454.3 million in fiscal 2005 from $433.1 million in fiscal 2004 due primarily to an increase in critical care sales, as well as an increase in cardiac care sales and a favorable foreign exchange impact during fiscal 2005 as a result of the weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the Company operates direct sales subsidiaries. This foreign exchange impact resulted in increased sales for fiscal 2005 of $5.5. The following is a summary of the Companys sales by product platform: Sales by Product Platform (in millions) For the years ended August 31, 2005 August 31, 2004 Central venous catheters $235.2 $ 222.7 Specialty catheters 142.3 135.1 Non Arrow distributed products 7.9 12.0 Subtotal critical care 385.4 369.8 Cardiac care 68.9 63.3 TOTAL $454.3 $ 433.1 Sales of critical care products increased 4.2% to $385.4 million from $369.8 million in fiscal 2004 due primarily to increased sales of central venous catheters and specialty catheters, offset by decreased sales of products distributed by Stepic Medical, the Companys former New York City distributor, the net assets of which it acquired in September 2002. Sales of central venous catheters increased in fiscal 2005 due primarily to a continued increase in the number of hospitals that are purchasing the Companys procedure kits featuring its safety devices and ARROWg+ard(R) antiseptic surface treatments, offset in part by decreased sales of neonatal products resulting from the Companys previously reported decision in January 2005 to temporarily cease manufacturing, shipping and selling of its Neo[heart]Care(R) product line until it completes the integration of its Neo[heart]Care(R) manufacturing operations and implementation of all corrective actions in response to previously reported FDA compliance concerns. Sales of specialty catheters increased in fiscal 2005 due to improved sales of arterial products, special procedure products, intravenous and extension sets, and epidural products. Sales of cardiac care products increased 8.8% to $68.9 million from $63.3 million in fiscal 2004 due primarily to increased international sales of both intra aortic balloon pumps and Super Arrow Flex(R) products. Total Company U.S. sales decreased 0.8% to $277.6 million from $279.9 million in the prior year principally as a result of decreased sales of products distributed by Stepic Medical and decreased sales of neonatal products for the reason described above, offset in part by increased sales of specialty catheters. International sales increased by 15.3% to $176.7 million from $153.2 million in the prior year, principally as a result of increased sales of central venous catheters, specialty catheters, IAB catheters and pumps, Super Arrow Flex(R) products and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, as noted above. International sales represented 38.9% of net sales in fiscal 2005, compared to 35.4% in fiscal year 2004. The ARROWg+ard(R) conversion percentages, which are the number of units sold with the ARROWg+ard(R) antiseptic surface treatments as a percentage of the Companys total multilumen and hemodialysis unit sales, increased to 37% in fiscal 2005 from 36% in the comparable prior year period for total Company sales. The ARROWg+ard(R) conversion percentages for the U.S. market increased to 64% in fiscal 2005 from 62% in the comparable prior year period. The safety device procedure kits conversion percentages, which are the number of units sold with the Companys procedure kits featuring its safety devices as a percentage of the total number of units sold of the Companys products that could potentially include safety device procedure kits, increased to 9% in fiscal 2005 from 7% in the comparable prior year period for total Company sales. The safety device procedure kit conversion percentages for the U.S. market in fiscal 2005 increased to 17% from 14% in the comparable prior year period. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit decreased 4.7% to $213.8 million in fiscal 2005 from $224.4 million in fiscal 2004. Gross margin decreased to 47.1% in fiscal 2005 compared to 51.8% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to several items, including: (1) the recording of a $12.4 million reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily for inventory components in excess of 36 months forecasted usage (as well as obsolete field service parts), consisting of $5.0 million of critical care product raw materials, semi finished and finished goods, $3.5 million of Hemosonic components and $3.9 million of IAB inventories, which was due primarily to a change in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 from an order point to a Materials Requirement Planning system and an analysis in greater detail of planned future usage as compared to inventory quantities on hand; as a result, the Company was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory; (2) the recording of a provision to cost of sales of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 for inventory and manufacturing equipment related to the Companys LionHeart LVAS as a consequence of the Companys decision in April 2005 to discontinue the development, sales and marketing programs related to the LionHeart; (3) incremental cost of sales of $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 related to the Companys voluntary early retirement program; (4) a $2.1 million write off of manufacturing equipment no longer in use based on physical inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of the Companys worldwide equipment; (5) lower margins realized in fiscal 2005 on the sale of inventories of products acquired as part of the Companys purchase of the net assets of AB Medica, the Companys former Italian distributor, in September 2004, as further discussed below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities"; and (6) unfavorable inventory adjustments in fiscal 2005 resulting from the scrapping of returned goods and periodic cycle counting of inventories. This negative impact on margins relative to the prior fiscal year was offset in part by: (1) a $3.5 million reduction in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for a correction of fixed asset lives related to manufacturing equipment in the Companys non U.S. facilities, as those lives were (23) shorter than those prescribed by the Companys policy; (2) higher margins resulting from increased sales of the Companys procedure kits featuring its safety devices and ARROWg+ard(R); (3) higher than average margins realized on increased sales of renal access products during fiscal 2005 associated with the Companys acquisition of Diatek in November 2002; and (4) higher cost of sales in fiscal 2004 due to the Companys write off of $3.1 million of inventory in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 for certain LionHeart components that became obsolete with the Companys decision during that quarter not to proceed with the LionHeart Phase II U.S. clinical trials using the first generation LionHeart power system. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses decreased by 2.3% to $29.7 million in fiscal 2005 from $30.4 million in the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 6.5% in fiscal 2005 compared to 7.0% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to decreased spending in fiscal 2005 on the LionHeart program, resulting from the Companys Board of Directors decision to discontinue the development, sales and marketing programs related to its LionHeart LVAS during the third quarter of fiscal 2005, offset in part by increased expenditures for the Companys critical care product line, including incremental research and development spending on its ARROWg+ard(R) antiseptic treatment products and peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, products, and increased expenditures for external professional fees in connection with the Companys completion of its investigation into the root causes for its recall of the NeoPICC Catheters. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 16.3% to $128.2 million in fiscal 2005 from $110.2 million in the comparable prior year period, and were 28.2% of net sales in fiscal 2005 compared to 25.4% in fiscal 2004. This increase was due primarily to the following factors: (1) incremental expenses related to the implementation of various special Company wide programs, including $5.0 million related to the Companys voluntary early retirement program, $4.0 million related to the Companys review of its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, $3.5 million incurred as a result of the Companys Project Operational Excellence program, $1.3 million in connection with the Companys corporate brand re positioning program, and $0.5 million related to the completion of a study by an outside consulting firm of the Companys LVAS program during the first quarter of fiscal 2005; (2) increased costs of $2.0 million related to the settlement of a claim for indemnification related to a divested business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which the Company paid on November 4, 2005; (3) increased international costs, including $1.8 million related to the expansion of the Companys Italian direct sales subsidiary following the Companys acquisition of AB Medica in September 2004, $1.5 million resulting from the weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the Company operates direct sales subsidiaries, and $0.9 million related to the continued enhancement of the Companys European sales office; and (4) increased amortization expense of $1.0 million related to the intangible asset included as part of the acquisition of AB Medica in September 2004. These increases were offset in part by the following: (1) decreased expenses of $2.7 million due to a reduction in the accrual for the Companys income growth bonus plan for its executive officers and key management employees; (2) decreased expenses of $1.2 million related to legal costs associated with the Companys defense of patent litigation relating to certain of its hemodialysis catheter products incurred in fiscal 2004; (3) the non recurrence of both a $1.3 million charge for severance and other costs incurred in fiscal 2004 in connection with the reorganization of some of the Companys operations and $0.6 million charge in fiscal 2004 for a write off of manufacturing equipment related to the LionHeart LVAS; and (4) decreased expenses of $0.3 million related to the correction of fixed asset lives associated with the Companys foreign sales subsidiaries. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES The Company recorded $1.9 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2005 compared to $0.2 million in fiscal 2004 related primarily to severance payments associated with its consolidation of operations at its Winston Salem, North Carolina and San Antonio, Texas facilities into other existing manufacturing facilities and severance, lease termination and other costs associated with the relocation of its European Distribution Center from Weesp, Netherlands to a more centralized European location in the Limberg region of Belgium. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities Multi Year Capital Investment Plan." OPERATING INCOME Principally due to the above factors, operating income decreased 35.5% to $54.0 million in fiscal 2005 from $83.7 million in fiscal 2004. OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSES, NET Other (income) expenses, net, was $0.8 million of income in fiscal 2005 as compared to $0.8 million of expense in fiscal 2004, due in part to the Company earning a higher amount of interest in fiscal 2005 on its investments of cash balances. Aggregate foreign exchange losses were $0.1 million and $0.6 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Foreign currency contracts resulted in less than $0.1 million of gains in fiscal 2005 and $0.7 million of losses in fiscal 2004. INCOME BEFORE TAXES As a result of the factors discussed above, income before income taxes decreased in fiscal 2005 by 33.9% to $54.8 million from $82.9 million in fiscal 2004. CZECH REPUBLIC TAX HOLIDAY The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 reflects the benefits of a tax holiday in respect of the Companys Czech Republic operations. This tax holiday is effective through August 2006 and is limited by the amount of capital permanently invested in the Czech Republic by way of property, plant and equipment purchased. This tax holiday resulted in a $2.8 million reduction in the Companys income tax provision for fiscal 2005, or $0.05 basic and diluted earnings per share. (24) NET INCOME Net income in fiscal 2005 decreased 29.3% to $39.5 million from $55.9 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of net sales, net income represented 8.7% in fiscal 2005 compared to 12.9% in fiscal 2004. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE The Companys effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 decreased to 27.9% from 32.5% in fiscal 2004 due primarily to: (1) a reduction in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 resulting from a shift in the mix of earnings to the Czech Republic, which carries a lower tax rate due to a tax holiday effective through August 2006, as further discussed below; (2) a reduction in taxable income without a corresponding reduction in research and development tax credits and the Extraterritorial Income Regime (the "ETI") tax deduction; and (3) more favorable than expected fiscal 2004 research and development tax credits resulting from the completion of the Companys analysis of these credits during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Partially offsetting these benefits that reduced the effective income tax rate was the establishment of a $1.4 million accrual for state income taxes primarily related to taxation of its intangible holding company. PER SHARE INFORMATION Basic earnings per common share were $0.89 in fiscal 2005, down 30.5%, or $0.39 per share, from $1.28 in fiscal 2004. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.88 in fiscal 2005, down 30.2%, or $0.38 per share, from $1.26 in fiscal 2004. Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used in computing basic earnings per common share increased to 44,300,408 in fiscal 2005 from 43,559,410 in fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of an increase in stock option exercises during fiscal 2005. Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used in computing diluted earnings per common share increased to 45,007,881 in fiscal 2005 from 44,301,960 in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in potentially dilutive shares resulting from an increased share price and an increase in stock option exercises for the reasons described above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OPERATING ACTIVITIES CASH FROM OPERATIONS. Arrows primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations, as shown in the Companys consolidated statement of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2006, net cash provided by operations was $70.7 million, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 10.7% from the prior year, due primarily to changes in certain working capital and other accounts, including accrued liabilities, prepaid pension costs, prepaid income taxes, accrued post retirement benefit obligation, inventories, deferred income tax and accounts receivable, all as described below. ACCRUED LIABILITIES. Accrued liabilities decreased $4.7 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a $12.1 million increase in fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the payment of $2.0 million in November 2005 for the settlement of an indemnification claim related to a divested business and professional service fees accrued at August 31, 2005 associated with the Companys assessment of its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The increase in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to (1) the establishment of a deferred revenue account in fiscal 2005 of $4.3 million as a result of the Companys change in the accounting treatment related to its shipping terms, as further discussed below under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," resulting in the reversal of sales and a corresponding increase in deferred revenue, (2) the accrual of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for the settlement of an indemnification claim related to a divested business, which the Company paid in November 2005, and (3) an incremental accrual related to professional service fees for external auditing and internal audit assistance associated with the Companys assessment of its internal control over financial reporting. PREPAID PENSION COSTS. Prepaid pension costs increased $14.9 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a $8.1 million decrease in fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of eliminating the requirement for an additional minimum liability as of August 31, 2006 that the Company had recorded as of August 31, 2005 for its salaried employee pension plan. In fiscal 2005, the Company had recorded an additional minimum liability of $13.2 million for the Companys salaried employee pension as of August 31, 2005 due to the accumulated benefit obligation for the plan exceeding the fair value of plan assets, which occurred in fiscal 2005 primarily because of a reduction in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations as of August 31, 2005 compared to August 31, 2004 and the impact of the Companys Early Retirement Program during fiscal 2005, which, as described below, provided unreduced early retirement benefits to eligible electing retirees. This elimination of the additional minimum liability for the Companys salaried employee pension plan resulted in the change from a liability at August 31, 2005 to a prepaid pension asset balance at August 31, 2006. Offsetting this increase were smaller payments in fiscal 2006 required to fund certain of the Companys pension plans. PREPAID INCOME TAXES. Prepaid income taxes increased $9.5 million in fiscal 2006 due to the conclusion of competent authority proceedings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 related to the Japanese tax assessment, as further discussed below, which resulted in the reclassification from long term assets to current assets of a $4.3 million income tax receivable from the U.S. Government and the recording of an additional $5.2 million representing an income tax refund due from the Japanese Government. ACCRUED POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION. Accrued post retirement benefit obligation decreased $1.5 million in 2006 compared to a $5.3 million increase in fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of the recording of a $13.2 million additional minimum liability for the Companys salaried employee pension plan as of August 31, 2005, as further described above. INVENTORIES. Inventories increased $7.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a $0.7 million decrease in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2006 increase is due primarily to (1) increased finished goods resulting from the Companys worldwide initiatives to produce and maintain sufficient levels of inventory required to meet growing customer demand, and (2) increased raw materials required to meet higher line fill rate standards, support the launch of certain of the Companys new products, including its Maximal Barrier central venous access kit and Pressure Injectable PICC, and buildup of the Companys supply of sole source components, offset in part by reduced inventory (25) costs due to lower manufacturing variances from standard costs generated during the second half of fiscal 2006, partially as a result of the Companys manufacturing capital investment program, which will be recognized in the first half of fiscal 2007. The decrease in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to: (1) a reduction of inventory associated with the recording of a $12.4 million reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily for inventory components in excess of 36 months forecasted usage (as well as obsolete field service parts) consisting of $5.0 million of critical care product raw materials, semi finished and finished goods, $3.5 million of Hemosonic components and $3.9 million of IAB inventories, which was due primarily to a change in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 from an order point to a Materials Requirement Planning system and an analysis in greater detail of planned future usage to inventory quantities on hand; as a result, the Company was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory; and (2) a $2.9 million write off of inventory related to the Companys LionHeart LVAS as a result of the Companys decision in April 2005 to discontinue this program. These decreases were offset in part by (1) additional production and related manufacturing costs necessary to support the Companys higher rate of sales, (2) incremental inventory value of $2.0 million recorded as of August 31, 2005 as a result of the Companys change in the accounting treatment related to its shipping terms in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, and (3) increased inventory in connection with the anticipated introduction of the enhanced version of the Companys AutoCAT(R)2 WAVE IAB and related LightWAVE catheter system. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. Deferred income taxes decreased $7.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a $5.3 million increase in fiscal 2005. The decrease in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the realization of the deferred tax assets associated with the capital loss carryforward and a decrease in deferred income taxes related to the Companys adjustment of its additional minimum pension liability for its salaried employee pension plan, as further described above. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Accounts receivable increased $5.9 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a $7.1 million increase in fiscal 2005. Accounts receivable, measured in days sales outstanding during the period, was 73 days at both August 31, 2006 and August 31, 2005. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had an accounts receivable balance from its Italian customers of $10.2 million, of which approximately 72% is related to Italian Government backed hospital customers. The Company increased its direct sales in this region following its acquisition of AB Medica in September 2004 by taking over the sales formerly conducted by this former distributor. As of August 31, 2006, the days sales outstanding was 280 days, which is significantly higher than that of the Companys overall August 31, 2006 average customer days sales outstanding of 73 days. However, according to information provided by Italys National Health Service as of March 19, 2005, the average days sales outstanding for medical equipment supply companies in the Italian market ranges from approximately 300 to 330 days. The Companys payment terms in this market are generally 90 days. The Company has concluded that the Government of Italy typically delays payments to its government backed hospitals, which in turn has impacted the Companys overall days sales outstanding. The Italian government backed hospitals have historically paid customers 100% of their outstanding receivables. As a result, the Company currently believes that the ultimate collectibility of these receivables, net of discounts, is not a significant risk. However, because the Companys assessment of this situation is based in part on political factors beyond its control, the Company cannot assure that all of these receivables will be collected or when they will be collected, and will continue to evaluate their collectibility and establish reserves when and to the extent necessary. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had recorded an allowance of $0.1 million to reserve for specifically identified, potentially uncollectible, private Italian customer balances. The Company currently evaluates all of its trade receivables on a regular basis, including those with its Italian customers, to ensure that each receivable is recorded at net realizable value. EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded $6.9 million in total costs with respect to its previously reported Early Retirement program, of which $1.9 million was recorded to cost of sales and $5.0 million to selling, general and administrative expenses. Of the $6.9 million in total costs, $2.8 million was related to pension and other post retirement benefits, and $3.0 million was a cash charge related to severance and related costs. The remaining $1.1 million was incurred as a non cash charge for accelerated vesting of stock options held by participants in this program. A total of 28 participants elected to participate in this program, including, as previously reported, the Companys former President and Chief Operating Officer and its former Executive Vice President Global Business Development. JAPANESE TAX ASSESSMENT. In March 2004, the Company made a payment of $10.0 million to settle a tax assessment related to an ongoing Japanese Government tax audit of the Companys transfer pricing with its Japanese subsidiary. In order to recover a majority of this Japanese tax assessment, the Company initiated competent authority proceedings with the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the competent authority proceedings were completed and the Company recorded a favorable tax credit of $3.7 million to reflect relief from a tax assessment related to transfer pricing between the U.S. and the Companys Japanese subsidiaries for its fiscal years 1998 through 2004. INVESTING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used in the Companys investing activities increased to $60.0 million in fiscal 2006 from $44.5 million in fiscal 2005, due primarily to the Companys acquisition, as further discussed below, of certain assets of Kimal in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, incremental purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2006 and increased capital expenditures in support of its multi year capital investment plan, also as discussed below. This increase was offset in part by the Companys acquisition, as further discussed below, of certain assets of AB Medica in fiscal 2005 and costs incurred in fiscal 2005 to expand the Companys finished goods warehouse and distribution center in Asheboro, North Carolina. ACQUISITION OF AB MEDICA. On September 3, 2004, the Company purchased certain assets of one of its distributors in Italy, AB Medica S.p.A. ("ABM"), for a total purchase price of approximately $9.3 million, with additional amounts payable contingent upon the sales levels of products under sales contracts purchased by the Company. ABM had been one of the Companys distributors in Italy since (26) 1982. The asset purchase agreement included the purchase of customer lists and distributorship rights, as well as the inventory and specified contracts associated with the sale by ABM of the Companys products. The Company began selling directly in Italy through its subsidiary, Arrow Italy S.p.A., in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. As of August 31, 2006, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the Company had paid $9.0 million in cash and recorded a current liability of $0.3 million for additional payment installments. The purchase price for this acquisition did not exceed the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and, therefore, no goodwill has been recorded by the Company. Intangible assets acquired of $6.1 million, consisting of customer lists and distributorship rights, are being amortized over five years based on the anticipated period over which the Company expects to benefit from the transaction. Included in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was a $1.5 million charge, or $1.0 million against net income ($0.02 diluted earnings per share), for the step up of inventory purchased from ABM. The results of operations of this business are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price for this acquisition was allocated as follows: (in millions) Inventories $ 3.2 Intangible assets 6.1 Total purchase price $ 9.3 ACQUISITION OF KIMAL PLC. On April 3, 2006, the Company purchased certain assets of one of its distributors in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, Kimal PLC, for a total purchase price of approximately $10.6 million, subject to post closing adjustments. Kimal had been one of the Companys flagship distributors in Europe for more than 27 years and continues to distribute the Companys products in the Middle East region. The asset purchase agreement includes the purchase of customer lists, distributorship rights, as well as the inventory and specified contracts associated with Kimals sale of the Companys products in the UK and Ireland. In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company began selling directly in the UK through its subsidiary, Arrow International UK Limited, and selling in Ireland through a distributor previously utilized by Kimal. As of August 31, 2006, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, the Company had paid $9.6 million in cash and recorded a current liability of $1.0 million for additional payment installments. The purchase price for this acquisition did not exceed the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and, therefore, no goodwill has been recorded by the Company. Intangible assets acquired of $8.8 million, consisting of customer lists and distributorship rights, are being amortized over five years based on the anticipated period over which the Company expects to benefit from the transaction. Included in fiscal 2006 was a $1.3 million charge to cost of goods sold, or $0.9 million against net income ($0.02 diluted earnings per share), for the step up of inventory purchased from Kimal. The results of operations of this business are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price for this acquisition was allocated as follows: (in millions) Inventories $ 1.8 Other current assets Intangible assets 8.8 Total purchase price $ 10.6 MULTI YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLAN. As previously reported, in April 2004 the Companys Board of Directors authorized the initiation of a multi year capital investment plan to increase its worldwide manufacturing capacity and rationalize its production operations. This plan was initiated to improve customer service, support projections for future growth and to integrate operations acquired in recent years, and included the construction or acquisition of additional manufacturing facilities in Zdar, Czech Republic and Chihuahua, Mexico, which was commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and completed during fiscal 2006. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, production of multi lumen central venous catheters began at the new Chihuahua facility and, in August 2006, production began at the Companys new Zdar facility. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had incurred a total of $29.3 million related to the construction of these new facilities. In addition, as of August 31, 2006, the Company had spent $4.7 million for new equipment in connection with this capital investment program and expects to incur an additional $10.3 million through the end of fiscal 2008, subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As part of its plans to rationalize its operations in the United States, in August 2004 the Company initiated the consolidation of its operations at its Winston Salem, North Carolina and San Antonio, Texas facilities into other existing manufacturing facilities. The Company incurred costs of $0.7 million in connection with this restructuring, consisting primarily of severance payments. Severance payments related to 53 employees primarily in manufacturing at both facilities. Additionally, on December 2, 2005, the Company sold its San Antonio, Texas facility and, as a result, recognized a pre tax gain of $0.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had completed its consolidation of these operations and had incurred all of the related costs. As part of its plans to rationalize its production operations and related logistics in Europe, in November 2004 the Company determined to move its European Distribution Center, previously situated in Weesp, Netherlands, to a more centralized European location in the Limberg region of Belgium in order to have better access to existing carrier transportation networks and allow for more cost competitive expansion of its European operations in the future. The Company continued to implement this relocation plan in fiscal 2006 and presently expects to complete it and related logistics during fiscal 2007 at an estimated total cost of $2.0 million. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had incurred costs of $1.6 million related to this relocation, of which $0.9 million had been paid. PROJECT OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE. During fiscal 2006, the Company continued to take additional steps in implementing its Project Operational Excellence program designed to help it achieve operational process excellence in four key areas: product quality, safety, customer service and cost. This program includes (1) as discussed above under "Multi Year Capital Investment Plan," restructuring the Companys manufacturing to increase production capacity and better align its production facilities with the geographical markets they serve, (2) improving the effectiveness of the Companys production technology by investing in new, state of the art manufacturing equipment and processes, and (3) developing and implementing enhanced good manufacturing practices and quality systems to maintain and establish process excellence. (27) In connection with the Companys efforts to enhance its good manufacturing practices and quality system compliance, it incurred $1.4 million of outside consulting costs and internal out of pocket travel expenses in fiscal 2006, and anticipates spending an additional $0.1 million to complete this process during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company incurred $3.5 million of costs related to this program in fiscal 2005. All of these costs, in both fiscal 2005 and 2006, have been recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. FINANCING ACTIVITIES Financing activities provided $17.3 million of net cash in fiscal 2006 compared to using $9.8 million in fiscal 2005, primarily as a result of the Companys increased borrowing under its revolving credit facilities and, in particular, its Czech Republic credit facility used to help finance the construction of its new manufacturing facility in Zdar, Czech Republic. Cash provided by financing activities, however, was reduced by an increase in dividend payments following the Companys increase in the amount of its quarterly dividend during the second quarter of each of fiscal 2005 and 2006, and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises. CREDIT FACILITIES. To provide additional liquidity and flexibility in funding its operations, the Company from time to time also borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing. At August 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had a revolving credit facility providing a total of $90.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively, in available revolving credit for general business purposes, of which $66.1 million and $21.8 million was outstanding, respectively, all of which is owed by its foreign subsidiaries. The increase in the available credit under this credit facility was effected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 primarily to provide increased funding for the construction of the Companys Zdar, Czech Republic manufacturing facility. At August 31, 2006, $40.1 million of such outstanding indebtedness related to the Companys Czech Republic subsidiary, as discussed above. Under this credit facility, the Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants. At August 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Failure to remain in compliance with these covenants could trigger an acceleration of the Companys obligation to repay all outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The Company currently anticipates that the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158 during fiscal 2007 will not have a material impact on its compliance with any of these debt covenants. The Company is currently considering refinancing some of its borrowings under this credit facility with longer term fixed rate debt. Certain other subsidiaries of the Company had revolving credit facilities totaling the U.S. dollar equivalent of $31.6 and $32.0 million, of which $4.9 and $5.1 million were outstanding as of August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest rate terms for both U.S. and foreign bank credit facilities are based on either bids provided by the lender, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (TIBOR), plus applicable margins. Interest is payable monthly during the revolving credit period. At August 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings was 2.9% per annum. Combined borrowings under these facilities increased $44.1 million during fiscal year 2006, all of which was related to foreign borrowings. INFLATION AND SEASONALITY During the periods discussed above, the overall effects of inflation and seasonality on the Companys business were not significant. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS A summary of all of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of August 31, 2006 were as follows: Payments due or Commitment Expiration by Period Less More Contractual Obligations and than 1 3 3 5 than 5 Commercial Commitments Total 1 year years years years (in Millions) Current maturities of long term debt $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ $ $ Operating leases 20.9 4.3 6.0 3.5 7.1 Purchase obligations (1) 29.1 29.1 Other long term obligations 0.6 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 Lines of credit (2) 71.0 71.0 Standby letters of credit 2.3 2.3 Total cash contractual obligations and commercial commitments $ 124.9 $ 107.8 $ 6.1 $ 3.6 $ 7.4 (1) Includes open purchase orders primarily relating to the purchase of raw materials, equipment and certain consulting and information system services. (2) Includes short term indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries under various revolving credit facilities, as discussed above. (28) OUTLOOK Based upon its present plans, the Company believes that cash generated from its operations and available credit resources, including its ability to extend maturities of borrowings outstanding under its lines of credit in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, will be adequate to repay current portions of long term debt, to finance currently planned capital expenditures, including those remaining pursuant to the Companys multi year capital investment plan and other initiatives related to its Project Operational Excellence, as discussed above, and to meet the currently foreseeable liquidity needs of the Company. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company has disclosed in Note 1 to its consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report those accounting policies that it considers to be significant in determining its results of operations and financial position. In all material respects, the accounting principles utilized by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, actuarial valuations and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by the Companys management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, the Company believes that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements. The Companys management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and pervasive accounting policies used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized by the Company based upon estimates of the time its products are delivered and title and risk of loss has passed to its customer. The Companys net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers, less certain related charges, including discounts, returns, rebates and other allowances. Such charges are recognized against revenue on an accrual basis. The Company offers sales discounts to certain customers based on prior experience with these customers, business needs and regional competition. Product returns are permitted. The accrual for product returns is based on the Companys history of actual product returns. Historically, product returns have not been material. The Companys practice is to credit or replace lost or damaged shipments. The Company grants sales rebates to certain distributors upon achievement of agreed upon pricing for sales of the Companys products to hospitals. Incurred but unpaid rebates are accrued by the Company in the period in which they are incurred. The Companys rebate accrual is based on its history of actual rebates paid. The Companys reserves for rebates are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value. The Company relies on prior payment trends while giving consideration to other criteria such as political risk, financial status and other factors to estimate the cash which ultimately will be received. Such amounts cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date. The Company regularly reviews individual past due balances over 90 days and over a specific amount for collectibility and maintains a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible. The Company also maintains an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables, determined based on historical trends. Inventory: The Company uses a standard cost system and cost is determined by the "first in, first out" (FIFO) method. This standard cost system uses estimates of overhead absorption, direct labor hours, production volumes and yields. The Company uses a materials management program for identifying, redeploying and or destroying slow moving, inactive or potentially obsolete inventory. An adjustment to net realizable value is recorded for all inventory specifically identified as slow moving, inactive or potentially obsolete based on a quarterly assessment performed by the Companys management. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company changed from an order point to a Materials Requirement Planning system and compared in greater detail planned future usage to inventory quantities on hand and, as a result, was able to modify its estimates used to account for excess inventory. As a result of this modification of its estimates, the Company recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 a $12.4 million reserve primarily for inventory components in excess of 36 months forecasted usage (as well as obsolete field service parts), consisting of $5.0 million of critical care raw materials, semi finished and finished goods, $3.5 million of HemoSonic components and $3.9 million of IAB inventories. Inventory in excess of 36 months of forecasted usage may be used in the future if production requirements increase. For certain new products, the Company manufactures inventory in anticipation of product launch. As of August 31, 2006, the Company had $0.4 million of inventory related to its HemoSonic(TM) hemodynamic monitoring devices. The Company is currently developing improvements to this (29) product that it believes should enhance the demand for this product in the marketplace. The Companys inventory is evaluated on an ongoing basis and is adjusted as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions. Product Liability: The Company provides reserves for product liability by utilizing loss estimates prepared by the primary product liability insurance carrier with adjustments, as appropriate, based upon managements perspective on the ultimate projected claim, giving consideration to the perspective of outside counsel and other relevant factors. The Companys evaluation of its reserve is based on industry standards while taking into consideration the Companys specific claims experience. The Company records a reserve regarding a particular claim when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a reserve is not recorded. The Companys primary global product liability insurance policy is on a claims made basis. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company uses several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating its expense and liability related to these plans. These factors include assumptions about discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases, as determined by the Company within specified guidelines. In addition, the Companys actuarial consultants also utilize subjective assumptions, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences, depending on their magnitude, could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded by the Company in any particular period. Net periodic pension cost is recorded in operating expenses in amounts determined by the Companys actuaries and is based on managements estimates of expected interest rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected compensation increases. These estimates reflect managements best judgments in the current circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates. Interest rate assumptions are based on market rates at the beginning of the Companys fiscal year. Expected rates of return on plan assets are based in part on the Companys historical asset portfolio performance over the prior ten year period and also on the estimated rate of return on plan assets in the future. The Companys rate of compensation increase assumption is based on its historical compensation percentage increases as well as its expected rate increases in future periods. Income Taxes: The Companys effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of research and development tax credits, deductions associated with the Extraterritorial Income Tax regime/Section 199 deduction and a tax holiday in the Czech Republic. Because the Company operates in a number of domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions, the statutory rates within these various jurisdictions are considered in determining the Companys overall effective tax rate. Managements judgment is required to determine the Companys consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax balances and any valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets. The Companys management also considers open statutory periods, current and anticipated audits, and the impact that any adverse adjustments would have on the Companys current and prospective overall effective tax rate. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and has not established valuation allowances. The Company deems all undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries permanently invested and, accordingly, has not established a tax provision for any repatriation of retained earnings in these entities. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4", in November 2004. This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 Chapter 4 "Inventory Pricing" to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 151, effective September 1, 2005. The impact of this Statement on the Companys consolidated financial statements was not material to its results of operations for fiscal 2006. The FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment an amendment of SFAS No. 123 and 95" in December 2004. This statement requires that the cost of all forms of equity based compensation granted to employees, excluding employee stock ownership plans, be recognized in a companys income statement and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the stock options. This statement replaces the guidance in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In addition, the SEC issued SAB No. 107 "Share Based Payment", in March 2005, which provides supplemental SFAS No. 123R guidance based on the views of the SEC. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effective September 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. The adoption of this statement resulted in a charge of $3.9 million in fiscal 2006 to income from continuing operations and income before income taxes, of which $0.5 million was recorded to cost of sales, $0.4 million to research and development, and $3.0 million to selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges impacted net income by $3.4 million, or $0.07 basic and diluted earnings per share, in fiscal 2006. The tax benefit from this stock option expense is less than the statutory tax benefit because SFAS No. 123R precludes the Company from recognizing a tax benefit on future disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options until these dispositions occur. (30) The FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109" ("FIN 48"), in July 2006. The intent of FIN 48 is to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This interpretation imposes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48 and has not yet determined the impact this adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)", in September 2006. This statement requires that an employer recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end. The provisions of SFAS No. 158 will be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company currently estimates that the adoption of this statement will result in a charge of approximately $26.0 million to other comprehensive expense as of August 31, 2007. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB No. 108") in September 2006, to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of their financial statements and related disclosures. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for errors that were not previously deemed material but are material under the guidance in SAB No. 108. The Company currently believes that this statement will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK Due to the global nature of its operations, the Company is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Such exposures arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily from translation into U.S. dollars from foreign currencies of results of operations from outside the United States, intercompany loans, and intercompany purchases of inventory. The Company is also exposed to interest rate changes. The Companys objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes. The Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and anticipated foreign currency revenues to meet these objectives. The contracts involve Japanese yen and other foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the value of the related exposures in the Companys income statement. It is the Companys policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent exposures exist and not to enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. The fair value of all the Companys foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at August 31, 2006 was $0.4 million. The following analysis estimates the sensitivity of the fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts to hypothetical 10% favorable and unfavorable changes in spot exchange rates at August 31, 2006 and 2005: Fair Value of Foreign Currency Forward Contracts (in millions) August 31, 2006 August 31, 2005 10% adverse rate movement $ (0.2) $ (0.9) At August 31st rates 10% favorable rate movement $ (0.6) $1.4 The Company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding at August 31, 2006 and 2005. Any gains and losses on the fair value of forward and option contracts would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transactions or anticipated transactions. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the percentage of the Companys sales invoiced in currencies other than U.S. dollars was 27.5%, 27.1% and 24.3%, respectively. In addition, a part of the Companys cost of goods sold is denominated in foreign currencies. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, which are derivative financial instruments, with major financial institutions to reduce the effect of these foreign currency risk exposures, primarily on U.S. dollar cash inflows resulting from the collection of intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge anticipated sales in foreign currencies to foreign subsidiaries. Such transactions occur throughout the year and are probable, but not firmly committed. Foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period, and the resulting gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in Other (Income) / Expense of the Companys consolidated statements of income. Realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign denominated assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. The premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are recorded as assets and amortized over the life of the option. Other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties, the Companys maximum exposure related to foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid. The total (31) premiums authorized to be paid in any fiscal year cannot exceed $1.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Foreign Currency Management Policy Statement approved by the Companys Board of Directors in fiscal 2001. Gains and losses on purchased option contracts result from changes in intrinsic or time value. Both time value and intrinsic value gains and losses are recorded in shareholders equity (as a component of comprehensive income) until the period in which the underlying sale by the foreign subsidiary to an unrelated third party is recognized, at which point those deferred gains and losses are recognized in net sales. By their nature, all such contracts involve risk, including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. Accordingly, losses relating to these contracts could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. Based upon the Companys knowledge of the financial condition of the counterparties to its existing foreign currency forward contracts, the Company believes that it does not have any material exposure to any individual counterparty. The Companys policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes. As of October 1, 2006, outstanding foreign currency forward contracts totaling the U.S. dollar equivalent of $35.6 million mature at various dates through June 2007. As of October 1, 2006, the Company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding. The Company expects to continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts to manage its exposure, although there can be no assurance that the Companys efforts in this regard will be successful. The Companys exposure to credit risk consists principally of trade receivables. Hospitals and international dealers account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required. The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the Companys ongoing credit review procedures. Additional Quantitative and Qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g., interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk) are set forth in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
