Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Forward Looking Statements This report contains a number of forward looking statements relative to our future plans and our expectations concerning the North American customer care and billing industry, as well as the converging communications industry it serves, and similar matters. These forward looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward looking statements. Some of the risks that are foreseen by management are outlined above within Item 1A., Risk Factors. Item 1A. constitutes an integral part of this report, and readers are strongly encouraged to review this section closely in conjunction with MD&A. Management Overview Our Company. We are a leading provider of outsourced billing, customer care and print and mail solutions and services supporting the North American communications market. Our solutions support some of the worlds largest and most innovative providers of bundled multi channel video, Internet, and IP based services. Our unique combination of solutions, services and expertise ensures that communication providers can continue to rapidly launch new service offerings, improve operational efficiencies and deliver a high quality customer experience in a competitive and ever changing marketplace. As noted above, the North American communications industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last few years, resulting in a large percentage of the market being served by a fewer number of service providers with greater size and scale. Consistent with this market concentration, a large percentage of our revenues from continuing operations are generated from a limited number of clients, with approximately 70% of our revenues for 2006 being generated from our four largest clients, which are Comcast, EchoStar, Time Warner, and Charter. Key Changes Made to Our Business During 2005. In 2005, we made several changes to our business operations in order to intensify our focus on our core competencies in the cable and DBS markets utilizing our ACP product and related services and improve our operating results. The most significant were the sale of our GSS Business to Comverse on December 9, 2005 and the sale of our plaNet Consulting business to a group of private investors led by the plaNet management team on December 30, 2005. These two businesses had been underperforming to our financial expectations and were no longer considered part of our core strategy, and thus were sold. As a result, we have reflected the results of operations for the GSS Business and plaNet Business as discontinued operations in our results of operations for all periods presented. In addition, in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the GSS Business, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we incurred restructuring charges within our continuing operations of $7.1 million. These restructuring charges, and greater details of the sale of the GSS and plaNet businesses, are discussed below and in Notes 2 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during 2005 we also made several changes to our Executive Management team and Board of Directors. Most notably was the retirement of Mr. Neal Hansen, our then current Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. In consideration for certain changes to his employment agreement and for post termination consulting services to be provided as a result of his retirement, we agreed to pay Mr. Hansen $9.6 million. Of this amount, $7.6 million was paid in 2006 and $2.0 million was paid on January 2, 2007. We recorded expense related to Mr. Hansens retirement package in 2006, 2005, and 2004 of $0.2 million, $8.9 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. The expense related to this matter is reflected within the Selling, General and Administrative caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. As a result of the retirement of Mr. Hansen, Mr. Edward Nafus, our then Executive Vice President and President of our Broadband Division, was added to our Board of Directors in March 2005, and assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer and President of our company effective April 1, 2005. In addition, effective July 1, 2005, Mr. Bernard Reznicek, a current Board member, was named non executive Chairman of the Board to replace Mr. Hansen. 21 Table of Contents 2006 Highlights. In 2006, we continued to execute on our decision to intensify our focus on our core competencies and evaluate ways in which we can achieve our objectives, align our organization to focus on our strengths, and maximize our opportunities within the communications industry. As part of this strategy, we made certain changes to our management team and Board of Directors during 2006, summarized as follows: In April 2006, we announced that Mr. Peter Kalan, our then Chief Financial Officer, was named Executive Vice President of Business and Corporate Development, and Mr. Randy Wiese, our Chief Accounting Officer, was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. See our Form 8 K filed on April 25, 2006 for additional details of these matters. In July 2006, Mr. Robert M. Mike Scott was named our Chief Operating Officer. In November 2006, our Board of Directors named Mr. Joseph Ruble, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, as an Executive Officer. See our Form 8 K filed on November 17, 2006 for additional details of these matters. In November 2006, Mr. Ronald Cooper, an individual with significant operational experience in the cable and telecommunications industry, joined our Board of Directors, bringing our total number of Board members to eight, of which, seven members are independent directors. See our Form 8 K filed on November 17, 2006 for additional details of these matters. The market for customer care and billing systems is characterized by rapid changes in technology and is highly competitive with respect to the need for timely product innovations and new product introductions to enable communication providers to timely roll out new competitive product offerings while maintaining the highest standards of customer service. In response to the increased demand for such product enhancements, and the pace at which such changes are delivered, we substantially increased our internal investment in R&D during 2006 and acquired Telution on March 1, 2006. Telution was a Chicago based provider of operations support system (OSS) technologies that enabled communication companies to bring bundled, advanced services to market quickly and effectively. We acquired Telution and its COMX solution to expand our ability to support communication providers as they deliver advanced and IP based services. As a result of this acquisition, we have begun to extend our ability to support our clients sales, ordering, partnering and service provisioning processes as well as deliver enhanced customer care capabilities through all customer touch points the Web, interactive television, field service, statement, the call center and more. See Note 4 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of this transaction. We are currently working on the natural evolution of the ACP platform to incorporate the COMX platform, accelerating the development of our product offerings to enable operators to more easily bundle and deploy new service offerings. The integrated solution will provide enhanced product configuration, offer management and order workflow functionality specifically targeted to support our clients ability to manage the complexities of both consumer and business services markets. In addition, the integrated solution will enable operators to better support customers of bundled services as they choose new services and seek support for existing services. We believe that the investments we have made during 2006 have demonstrated our commitment to focus on our core competencies. Additionally, we continue to evaluate new opportunities and new ways to support our clients growth whether it be through R&D, acquisitions or partnerships. Results of Operations. A summary of our results of operations for 2006 is as follows: Our consolidated revenues from continuing operations for 2006 were $383.1 million, up slightly when compared to $377.3 million for 2005. This is a result of certain downward revenue pressures we experienced during 2006 related to several specific client matters, which were more than offset by the continued growth we saw in the use of various ancillary products and services we offer to our existing client base. Our operating expenses from continuing operations for 2006 decreased $4.3 million, or 1.4%, to $296.6 million, when compared to $300.9 million for 2005. The decrease in operating expenses from continuing operations between years is primarily due to the following: 22 Table of Contents Restructuring charges were $2.4 million for 2006, compared to $14.5 million for 2005, a decrease of $12.1 million. Primarily all of the restructuring charges incurred during 2005 and 2006 related to the changes that we made to our business operations during the fourth quarter of 2005. Restructuring charges reduced 2006 and 2005 income from continuing operations by $0.03 and $0.19, respectively, per diluted share. Expense related to the retirement of our former CEO was $0.2 million for 2006, as compared to $8.9 million for 2005, a decrease of $8.7 million. The $8.9 million of expense recorded for this item reduced 2005 net income from continuing operations by $0.12 per diluted share. These decreases were offset to a certain degree by the impact of the acquisition of Telution in March 2006, in which we incurred approximately $10 million of expense related to Telution, and an increase in labor related costs, primarily as a result of an increase in staff levels between periods related to the increase in our R&D efforts. Income from continuing operations (net of tax) for 2006 was $62.6 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 33.8% when compared to $46.7 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, for 2005. The restructuring charges and CEO retirement expense discussed above reduced 2005 income from continuing operations by $0.31 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for 2006 was positively impacted by a $17.9 million increase in interest and investment income over 2005. Interest and investment income was $22.0 million for 2006, as compared to $4.1 million for 2005, with the increase primarily attributed to the interest income earned on the cash proceeds received from the sale of the GSS Business in December 2005. Continuing operations for 2006 and 2005 include non cash charges related to depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation expense totaling $38.6 million (pretax impact), or $0.51 per diluted share, and $40.5 million (pretax impact), or $0.53 per diluted share, respectively. We continue to generate strong cash flows as a result of our profitable operations and through our effective management of our working capital items. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $415.5 million, compared to $392.2 million as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, we generated $118.2 million of cash flows from operating activities, as compared to $102.6 million for 2005, with the increase between years primarily related to changes in working capital items, as discussed in greater detail below. Other key matters related to our continuing operations for 2006 were as follows: Total customer accounts processed on our systems as of December 31, 2006 were 45.4 million, compared to 45.2 million as of December 31, 2005. The annualized revenue per processing unit (ARPU) for 2006 and 2005 was consistent between years at $7.81. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 90% of the cable customer accounts processed on our systems have been successfully migrated to our ACP platform. We expect to migrate the remaining cable customer accounts to the ACP platform by the end of 2007. We had no material client relationships scheduled for renewal in 2006, and do not have any material contracts up for renewal in 2007. In August 2006, we announced our plans to repurchase up to $350 million of our common stock under our Stock Repurchase Program. In conjunction with this action, our Board of Directors approved a 10 million share increase in the number of shares authorized for repurchase under our Stock Repurchase Program, bringing the total number of authorized shares to 30 million. Subsequent to this announcement, and through December 31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares, for a total of approximately $42.4 million (a weighted average price of $26.90 per share) towards our planned $350 million stock repurchase amount. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining number of shares authorized for repurchase under our Stock Repurchase Program is 14.4 million shares. Significant Client Relationships Comcast. Comcast continues to be our largest client. For 2006 and 2005, revenues from Comcast represented approximately 24% and 22%, respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations. Our processing agreement with 23 Table of Contents Comcast runs through December 31, 2008. Under the terms of the Comcast processing agreement, Comcast could remove one or more regions from our systems, or significantly reduce the number of customers on our systems, without automatically incurring a financial penalty. The Comcast processing agreement and related amendments are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC. The documents are available on the Internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details. EchoStar. EchoStar is our second largest client. For 2006 and 2005, revenues from EchoStar represented approximately 19% and 21%, respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we signed a new processing agreement with EchoStar to continue providing customer care and billing support services. The EchoStar processing agreement was effective November 1, 2005, runs through December 31, 2008, and provides EchoStar with the option to extend the term of the agreement for either one or two years beyond the end of December 2008. The EchoStar processing agreement provides for certain pricing reductions when compared to the previous processing agreement, which explains the decrease between 2006 and 2005 in the percentage of our revenues generated from EchoStar. The EchoStar processing agreement includes certain annual financial commitments. The EchoStar processing agreement and related amendments are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC. The documents are available on the Internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details. Time Warner. Time Warner is our third largest client. For 2006 and 2005, revenues from Time Warner represented approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations. Our processing agreement with Time Warner runs through March 31, 2013. The Time Warner processing agreement contains provisions establishing annual minimum customer account levels that have to be processed on our systems, which we expect Time Warner to exceed based on the number of Time Warner customers currently on our systems. Under the terms of the Time Warner processing agreement, Time Warner could remove one or more regions from our systems, or significantly reduce the number of customers on our systems, without automatically incurring a financial penalty. Charter. Charter is our fourth largest client. For 2006 and 2005, revenues from Charter represented approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations. Our contract with Charter runs though December 31, 2012. The Charter contract contains certain annual minimum customer account levels that have to be processed on our systems. Adelphia. Adelphia has historically been our fifth largest client, with revenues from Adelphia for 2006 and 2005 representing approximately 5% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations. Adelphia had been operating under bankruptcy protection since June 2002. On July 31, 2006, Adelphia completed the sale of its broadband assets to Comcast and Time Warner. Prior to the closing of this transaction, we processed approximately three million Adelphia domestic broadband customer accounts (the Acquired Customer Accounts) on our systems under a processing agreement that ran through March 31, 2009. Upon closing of this transaction, the Acquired Customer Accounts we processed remained on our systems and were transferred to the respective Comcast and Time Warner processing agreements. This transaction had the following impacts to our business: In August 2006, we recognized $2.8 million of one time, non recurring revenues related to the Adelphia processing agreement when the Acquired Customer Accounts were transferred under our Comcast and Time Warner processing agreements. These revenues included items such as upfront payments for services that had previously been deferred and were being recognized ratably over the remaining term of the Adelphia processing agreement. Our monthly processing revenues related to the Acquired Customer Accounts were approximately $4.5 million lower in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to the Comcast and Time Warner contracts having lower per unit pricing than the Adelphia contract (due to the relative size of Comcast and Time Warner when compared to Adelphia). The $4.5 million reflects five months of invoices at the lower per unit pricing for these Acquired Customer Accounts. Although there was some movement of customer accounts between Comcast and Time Warner as the result of this transaction, it had minimal impact on the overall number of customer accounts processed on our systems as of the end of 2006. 24 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Program We currently have a stock repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors, authorizing us to repurchase up to 30 million shares of our common stock from time to time as market and business conditions warrant (the Stock Repurchase Program). To facilitate the repurchase of our common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, we have from time to time established formal plans with financial institutions that comply with the provisions of Rule 10b5 1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule 10b5 1 Plan). In effect, a Rule 10b5 1 Plan allows us to achieve our stock buyback objectives more readily by permitting the execution of trades during periods that would otherwise be prohibited by internal trading policies. A Rule 10b5 1 Plan supplements any stock repurchases we may decide to purchase under the existing terms of our Stock Repurchase Program. In April 2005, we established a Rule 10b5 1 Plan to repurchase on the open market up to a maximum of 3 million shares of our common stock. In May 2006, we reached the 3 million share maximum established under the Rule 10b5 1 Plan, and therefore, the Rule 10b5 1 Plan expired. In July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $350 million of our outstanding common stock under our Stock Repurchase Program. In August 2006, we established a new Rule 10b5 1 Plan to facilitate the repurchase of the $350 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $42.4 million (a weighted average price of $26.90 per share) toward our planned $350 million stock repurchase amount. The number of shares repurchased under our new Rule 10b5 1 Plan is primarily based upon predetermined factors that were established when we implemented the plan in August 2006. These factors are evaluated on a periodic basis for possible adjustment. Over time, there will likely be some variability around the number of shares repurchases due to changing market conditions, as well as the trading volume of our stock. We remain committed to completing the repurchase of $350 million of our outstanding common stock, but the time period is now expected to extend beyond our original estimate of 12 15 months due to various market factors that have impacted the pace at which we have bought back our common stock. As of December 31, 2006, a summary of the shares repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 2006 2005 2004 2003 1999 2002 Total Shares repurchased 2,485 3,808 2,983 6,339 15,615 Total amount paid $ 63,283 $ 72,968 $ 52,897 $ 199,710 $ 388,858 Weighted average price per share $ 25.46 $ 19.16 $ 17.73 $ 31.51 $ 24.90 As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program totaled 14.4 million shares. Stock Based Compensation Expense Stock based compensation expense is included in the following captions in the Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Continuing operations: Cost of processing and related services. $ 4,371 $ 3,259 $ 2,622 Cost of software, maintenance and services 713 758 871 Research and development 1,530 1,137 1,193 Selling, general and administrative 5,600 7,688 5,934 Restructuring charges 4,205 Total continuing operations 12,214 17,047 10,620 Discontinued operations 3,311 4,266 Total stock based compensation expense (1) $ 12,214 $ 20,358 $ 14,886 25 Table of Contents (1) The increase in stock based compensation expense for continuing operations in 2005 is due primarily to certain equity awards held by key members of our management team having a change in control provision that was triggered upon the closing of the sale of the GSS Business in the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in accelerated vesting for the equity awards impacted. See Notes 3 and 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our stock based compensation expense. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our accounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and the results of our business continuing operations. These critical accounting policies were determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting policies identified relate to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts receivable; (iii) impairment assessments of long lived assets; (iv) loss contingencies; (v) income taxes; and (vi) capitalization of internal software development costs. These critical accounting policies, as well as our other significant accounting policies, are disclosed in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition. The revenue recognition policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments that may have a material impact on our business continuing operations relate to: (i) the application of the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21) when determining a revenue arrangements separate units of accounting; and (ii) the accounting for software arrangements. For those revenue arrangements within the scope of EITF No. 00 21, we are required to evaluate all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. If the deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their relative fair values, and applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered for the separate units of accounting. If the deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting, the consideration allocable to delivered items is combined with the consideration allocable to the undelivered items, and the appropriate recognition of revenue is then determined for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. For the processing agreements that we have historically evaluated under EITF No. 00 21, we have generally concluded that the deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting, and thus have treated the deliverables as a single unit of accounting, with the revenue recognized ratably over the term of the processing agreement. The determination of separate units of accounting, and the determination of objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items, if applicable, both require judgments to be made by us. The accounting for software arrangements, especially when software is sold in a multiple element arrangement, is complex and requires judgments in the following areas: (i) the identification of the separate elements of the software arrangement; (ii) the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements; (iii) the assessment of whether our hosted service transactions meet the requirements of EITF Issue No. 00 03, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97 2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entitys Hardware, to be treated as a separate element to the software arrangement; (iv) the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the software arrangement; and (v) the period of time maintenance services are expected to be performed. The evaluation of these factors, and the ultimate revenue recognition decisions, require significant judgments to be made by us. The judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized. In addition, because software licenses typically have little or no direct, incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue, these judgments could also have a significant effect on our results of operations. 26 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances, as well as a general allowance. Specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors, among others, as: (i) the aging of the accounts receivable balance; (ii) the clients past payment experience; (iii) the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business; and (iv) a deterioration in a clients financial condition, evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results, reduced credit ratings, and or a bankruptcy filing. In addition to the specific allowance, we maintain a general allowance for all our accounts receivable which are not covered by a specific allowance. The general allowance is established based on such factors, among others, as: (i) the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable, including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable; (ii) past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs; and (iii) the overall creditworthiness of the client base. Our credit risk is heightened due to our concentration of clients within the North American cable television and satellite industries. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable. Should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change significantly, an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary. Because of the overall significance of our gross billed accounts receivable balance ($111.2 million as of December 31, 2006), such an adjustment could be material. Impairment Assessment of Long Lived Assets. Long lived assets, which for us relates primarily to property and equipment, software and client contracts, are required to be evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. A long lived asset is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset, without consideration of interest, are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset. Once deemed impaired, even if by $1, the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows. The determination of estimated future cash flows and, if required, the determination of the fair value of a long lived asset, are by their nature, highly subjective judgments. Changes to one of more of the assumptions utilized in such an analysis could materially affect our impairment conclusions for long lived assets. Loss Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to claims (and potential claims) related to various items including but not limited to: (i) legal and regulatory matters; (ii) client and vendor contracts; (iii) product and service delivery matters; and (iv) labor matters. We follow the guidelines of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies in determining the appropriate accounting and disclosures for such matters, which requires us to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters, as well as the potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves for such contingencies, if any, for these contingencies is based on an analysis of the issues, often with the assistance of legal counsel. The evaluation of such issues, and our ultimate accounting and disclosure decisions, are by their nature, subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments. Should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly, an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary. Because of the potential significance of these issues, such an adjustment could be material. Income Taxes. We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate, which is primarily the U.S. (including both Federal and state income taxes). Various judgments are required in evaluating our income tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes. During the ordinary course of our business, there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities which could result in adverse outcomes. For these reasons, we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due. We adjust these reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the closing of a tax year upon the expiration of a statute of limitations. Should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly, an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary. Because of the potential significance of these issues, such an adjustment could be material. This income tax evaluation process requires us to estimate the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred income tax assets will be recovered, primarily from future taxable income. To the extent recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2006, we had net deferred income tax assets of $28.5 million, which represented approximately 4% of our total assets. We believe that between (i) carryback 27 Table of Contents opportunities to past periods with taxable income; and (ii) sufficient taxable income to be generated in the future, we will realize the benefit of our net deferred income tax assets. The assumption of future taxable income is, by its nature, subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments. Capitalization of Internal Software Development Costs. We expend substantial amounts on R&D for both new and existing (i.e., enhancements) software products and related services. Such costs are subject to capitalization under certain circumstances. The determination of whether internal software R&D costs are subject to capitalization is by its nature, highly subjective and involves significant judgments. This decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period by either: (i) capitalizing development costs; or (ii) expensing pre technological feasibility and pre application development stage research costs. Further, once capitalized, the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product. The determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental. Finally, capitalized software R&D costs are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for possible impairment as discussed above for other long lived assets. We did not capitalize any internal software R&D costs, as discussed above, during 2006, 2005, or 2004. In addition, we do not have any capitalized internal software R&D costs included in our December 31, 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that during these periods no material internal software R&D costs were required to be capitalized. Our conclusion is primarily based upon the fact that the feature rich, pre integrated, and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design, coding and testing methodologies, which include next generation software languages and development tools. Development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk. Substantially all of our internal software R&D efforts are of this nature, and therefore, we believe the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material. Detailed Discussion of Results of Operations Total Revenues. Total revenues from continuing operations for: (i) 2006 increased $5.8 million, or 1.5%, to $383.1 million, from $377.3 million for 2005; and (ii) 2005 increased $25.9 million, or 7.4%, to $377.3 million, from $351.4 million for 2004. The increases in total revenues from continuing operations between years relates primarily to an increase in our processing revenues. Processing Revenue. Processing revenues for: (i) 2006 increased $5.3 million, or 1.5%, to $351.8 million, from $346.5 million for 2005; and (ii) 2005 increased $19.9 million, or 6.1%, to $346.5 million, from $326.6 million for 2004. Processing revenues for 2006 were up slightly when compared 2005. This is a result of certain downward revenue pressures we experienced during 2006 related to several specific client matters, which were more than offset by the continued growth we see in the use of various ancillary products and services we offer to our existing client base. The downward revenue pressures consisted primarily of the following items: (i) lower revenues in 2006 from EchoStar due to new contract pricing becoming effective November 1, 2005; (ii) client regionalization projects which resulted in the movement of approximately one million customer accounts from our systems to a competitors system during the early part of 2006; (iii) lower revenues beginning in August 2006 related to the Adelphia Acquired Customer Accounts as a result of these accounts moving under our Comcast and Time Warner contracts, as discussed above; and (iv) $2.3 million related to one time contract termination and bankruptcy settlements recorded in 2005, with no comparable amounts in 2006. These downward pressures were more than offset by the continued growth we see in the use of various ancillary products and services we offer, which consist of such things as our marketing services and various customer care solutions, which include self care tools, professional services, system interfaces, and reporting tools. The increase in processing revenues between 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to: (i) an increase in the number of customer accounts processed on our systems; and (ii) increased usage of ancillary products and services, similar to those discussed directly above. Additional information related to processing revenues is as follows: Amortization of the client contracts intangible asset (reflected as a reduction of processing revenues) for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $13.4 million, $12.7 million, and $11.4 million, respectively. 28 Table of Contents Total customer accounts processed on our systems as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were 45.4 million, 45.2 million, and 43.5 million, respectively. As noted above, as a result of certain client regionalization projects, approximately one million customer accounts processed on our systems moved to a competitors system. However, this decrease was offset primarily by organic growth experienced by our clients. Additionally, as discussed above, the impact of the closing of the Adelphia transaction had minimal impact on the overall number of customer accounts processed on our systems as of the end of 2006. The increase in customer accounts processed on our systems between 2005 and 2004 relates primarily to organic growth experienced by our clients. ARPU for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $7.81, $7.81, and $7.46, respectively. The consistency in ARPU between 2005 and 2006 relates to our relatively consistent processing revenues between years, without a significant change in customer accounts processed, as addressed above. The increase in 2005 ARPU when compared to 2004 was primarily attributed to higher revenues related to our clients discretionary and variable use of ancillary products and services, as noted above. The ARPU for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $7.72 compared to $8.08 for the third quarter of 2006. The sequential decrease in ARPU between the third and fourth quarters of 2006 relates primarily to the Adelphia matters discussed above. Fourth quarter processing revenues related to the Adelphia Acquired Customer Accounts were $3.5 million lower when compared to that of the third quarter, which equates to a sequential decrease in ARPU of approximately $0.30 between the third and fourth quarters of 2006. Software, Maintenance and Services Revenues. Software, maintenance and services revenues for: (i) 2006 were relatively flat between years at $31.3 million, compared to $30.9 million for 2005, which includes revenues from Telution, which was acquired on March 1, 2006; and (ii) 2005 increased $6.1 million, or 24.2%, to $30.9 million, from $24.8 million for 2004. The increase between 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to an increase in software license sales of our workforce automation and call center solutions during the first half of 2005. Cost of Processing and Related Services. The cost of processing and related services revenues consists principally of the following: (i) data processing and communications costs; (ii) statement production costs (e.g., labor, paper, envelopes, equipment, equipment maintenance, etc.); (iii) client support organizations (e.g., our client support call center, account management, etc.); (iv) various product support organizations (e.g., product management and delivery, product maintenance, etc.); and (v) facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations. The costs related to product development (including enhancements to existing products) are included in R&D expenses. The cost of processing and related services for: (i) 2006 increased $3.2 million, or 1.9%, to $173.5 million, from $170.3 million; and (i) 2005 increased $23.5 million, or 16.0%, to $170.3 million, from $146.8 million for 2004. The increase in cost of processing and related services between 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs, to include the impact of annual merit wage increases. The increase in cost of processing and related services between 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to: (i) an increase in labor related costs, primarily as a result of annual merit wage increases and the increase in staff levels to support the growth opportunities of our VoIP products and services and to accommodate the migration of clients to ACP; (ii) an increase in data processing costs, primarily due to growth in the number of customers processed on our systems, and greater processing requirements for ACP functionality; and (iii) an increase in variable costs related to the delivery of ancillary products and services (e.g., print costs, etc.), which directly correlate with the increase in revenues related to ancillary products and services. Gross margin percentages related to our processing and related services revenues were 50.7%, 50.8%, and 55.0%, for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The relatively flat gross margins between 2006 and 2005 are consistent with the relatively flat revenues and cost of related revenues, as noted above. 29 Table of Contents The decrease in the gross margin percentages between 2005 and 2004 relates primarily to the increase in costs related to our ACP product initiatives without a commensurate increase in revenues associated with such initiatives. This is primarily the result of the investment we made in our ACP products and services, including the efforts to migrate our clients to the ACP platform, which began in 2004. We do not receive any additional revenue from our clients associated with their initial migration to the ACP platform. However, the ACP platform does facilitate the roll out of new products and services by our clients, which may result in additional revenue opportunities for us. Cost of Software, Maintenance and Services. The cost of software, maintenance and services revenues consists principally of the following: (i) client support organizations (e.g., our client support call center, account management, etc.); (ii) various product support organizations (e.g., product management and delivery, product maintenance, etc.); (iii) professional services organizations; (iv) facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations; (v) third party software costs and or royalties related to certain software products; and (vi) amortization of acquired software and acquired client contracts. The costs related to product development (including enhancements to existing products) are included in R&D expenses. The cost of software, maintenance and services for: (i) 2006 increased $1.3 million, or 6.4%, to $21.0 million, from $19.7 million; and (ii) 2005 decreased $5.3 million, or 21.3%, to $19.7 million, from $25.0 million for 2004. The increase in cost of software, maintenance and services between 2006 and 2005 was due primarily to the amortization of the Telution intangible assets acquired in March 2006. The decrease in cost of software, maintenance and services between 2005 and 2004 was related primarily to reductions in our personnel assigned to software maintenance projects. Gross margin (loss) percentages related to our software, maintenance and services revenues were 33.1%, 36.1%, and (0.8%), respectively, for 2006, 2005, and 2004. The improvement in the gross margin percentages between 2005 and 2004 is primarily related to lower costs between periods, as noted above, and 2005 having the benefit of the impact of increased software license sales of our workforce automation and call center solutions during the first half of 2005. Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses, and perform professional services. Our quarterly revenues for software licenses and professional services may fluctuate, depending on various factors, including the timing of executed contracts and revenue recognition, and the delivery of contracted services or products. However, the costs associated with software and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree of variability (i.e., these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time), and thus, fluctuations in our software and maintenance, professional services, and overall gross margins, will likely occur between periods. Overall Gross Margin (Exclusive of Depreciation). Our overall gross margin for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $188.6 million, $187.3 million, and $179.5 million, respectively. The overall gross margin percentages for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were 49.2%, 49.6%, and 51.1%, respectively. The changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage between 2006, 2005, and 2004 were due to the factors discussed above. R&D Expense. R&D expense for: (i) 2006 increased $12.3 million, or 36.1%, to $46.2 million, from $33.9 million; and (ii) 2005 increased $2.0 million, or 6.4%, to $33.9 million, from $31.9 million for 2004. The increase in R&D expense between 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to an increase in employees, to include the development personnel that came over in the acquisition of Telution, and is reflective of our increased focus on product development and enhancement efforts. The increase in R&D expense between 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to increased employee related costs, to include the impacts of the annual merit wage increases. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we focused our development and enhancement efforts on various R&D projects consisting principally of enhancements to ACP and related software products, which includes the integration of the Telution COMX product 30 Table of Contents with ACP beginning in March 2006. These development efforts are targeted to increase the functionalities and features of our products, including those necessary to service new and expanded product offerings provided by our clients (e.g., VoIP, commercial services, etc.). We did not capitalize any internal software development costs during 2006, 2005, and 2004. As a percentage of total revenues, R&D expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was 12.1%, 9.0%, and 9.1%, respectively. At this time, we expect our future R&D efforts to continue to focus on similar tasks as noted above, and we expect that over time our investment in R&D will approximate our historical investment rate of 10 12% of our total revenues. However, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2006 (which reflected R&D expense as a percentage of total revenues of approximately 14%), we expect this percentage to be at or above the top end of this range in the near term. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A). SG&A expense for: (i) 2006 decreased $9.4 million, or 17.8%, to $43.1 million, from $52.5 million for 2005; and (ii) 2005 increased $13.0 million, or 33.0%, to $52.5 million, from $39.5 million for 2004. As a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was 11.3%, 13.9%, and 11.2%, respectively. The decrease in SG&A expense between 2006 and 2005 relates primarily to the $8.7 million decrease in retirement benefits recorded for our former CEO between periods, as discussed above. The increase in SG&A expense between 2005 and 2004 relates primarily to: (i) an increase of $8.4 million related to the retirement benefits recorded for our former CEO, as discussed above; and (ii) an increase of $4.5 million in various personnel related costs, principally related to stock based compensation expense as a result of new equity awards. Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses. Depreciation expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $10.4 million, $9.9 million, and $10.4 million, respectively. The decrease in depreciation expense for 2005 relates primarily to the limited amount of capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003, as a result of our focus on cost controls during that time frame. Restructuring Charges. Our restructuring charges relate to various cost reduction initiatives implemented primarily as a result of the changes we made to our business operations in 2005. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of our cost reduction initiatives and related restructuring charges, including the current activity in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring charges. Restructuring charges included in total operating expenses, and the impact (net of related estimated income tax expense) these restructuring charges had on net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share, for 2006, 2005, and 2004, are as follows (in thousands, except diluted earnings per share): 2006 2005 2004 Activities related to the sale of the GSS Business: Stock based compensation related to change in control provision $ $ 3,783 $ Involuntary termination of executive officer 1,357 Involuntary termination of certain corporate support staff 379 590 Management incentive bonuses related to the GSS Business sale 1,409 Subtotal restructuring charges related to the sale of the GSS Business 379 7,139 Disposal of corporate aircraft 100 1,556 Termination of the FairPoint contract 1,115 6,209 Facility abandonments 748 (389 ) 1,045 All other restructuring charges 26 19 247 Total restructuring charges $ 2,368 $ 14,534 $ 1,292 Impact of restructuring charges on results of continuing operations (i.e., have reduced operating results): Net income $ 1,467 $ 9,311 $ 820 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.03 $ 0.19 $ 0.02 31 Table of Contents At this time, we do not expect to incur any material restructuring charges in 2007. Operating Income. Operating income for: (i) 2006 was $86.5 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, compared to $76.4 million, or 20.3% of total revenues for 2005; and (ii) 2005 was $76.4 million, or 20.3% of total revenues, compared to $96.5 million, or 27.5% of total revenues for 2004. The increases in operating income and the operating income margin between 2006 and 2005 were due primarily to the decreases in restructuring charges between years and the expense incurred in conjunction with the retirement of our former CEO, as discussed above. The $14.5 million of restructuring charges in 2005 and the $8.9 million of retirement benefits recorded in 2005 had the effect of reducing our operating margin by 6.2 percentage points for 2005. Ignoring the one time impact of these items on 2005, the comparable, normalized operating margins between years decreased, with such decrease in 2006 related primarily to our 2006 increase in R&D expense, and the impact of our Telution acquisition in March 2006. The decreases in operating income and the operating income margin between 2005 and 2004 were due primarily to the increase in restructuring charges between years, and the expense incurred in conjunction with the retirement of our former CEO, as discussed above. Ignoring the one time 6.2 percentage point impact of these items on 2005, the comparable, normalized operating margins between years decreased, with such decrease in 2005 related primarily to our investment in our ACP product initiatives without a commensurate increase in revenues associated with such initiatives. Our operating income margin for the fourth quarter of 2006 was approximately 21%, down from the third quarter of 2006 operating margin of approximately 23%. This downward trend is reflective of our increased R&D efforts (as discussed above), as well as new product support costs being incurred without a commensurate increase in revenues at this time. Our operating results include non cash charges related to depreciation, amortization (primarily shown as a reduction of processing revenues), and stock based compensation expense. The total amount of these non cash expenses, and their impact (net of related estimated income tax expense) on net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share, for 2006, 2005, and 2004 are as follows (in thousands, except diluted earnings per share): 2006 2005 2004 Non cash expenses related to: Depreciation $ 10,438 $ 9,862 $ 10,412 Amortization 15,913 13,586 11,598 Stock based employee compensation 12,214 17,047 10,620 Total $ 38,565 $ 40,495 $ 32,630 Impact of non cash expenses on results of continuing operations (i.e., have reduced operating results): Net income $ 23,895 $ 25,941 $ 20,720 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.51 $ 0.53 $ 0.40 Interest Expense. The following are the key points related to our interest expense between years: Interest expense for: (i) 2006 and 2005 remained consistent between periods at $7.5 million; and (ii) 2005 decreased $2.8 million, or 26.5%, to $7.5 million, from $10.3 million for 2004. The weighted average balance of our long term debt for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $230.0 million, $230.0 million, and $224.2 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our debt borrowings for 2006, 2005, and 2004, including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility, was 3.2%, 3.2%, and 4.1%, respectively. The change in the weighted average balance of our long term debt and the weighted average interest rate between 2005 and 2004 relates primarily to the issuance of our Convertible Debt Securities in June 2004 and the retirement of our 32 Table of Contents 2002 Credit Facility with the proceeds from such issuance. The Convertible Debt Securities have a stated coupon rate of 2.5%, which is substantially less than the interest rates paid on our previous bank debt. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our Convertible Debt Securities. Write off of Deferred Financing Costs. As result of the repayment and termination of the 2002 Credit Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Debt Securities in June 2004, we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs attributable to the 2002 Credit Facility of $6.6 million (pretax impact) during the second quarter of 2004, which had the effect of reducing our 2004 net income per diluted share by $0.08. Interest and Investment Income, net. Interest and investment income, net, for: (i) 2006 increased $17.9 million to $22.0 million, from $4.1 million for 2005; and (ii) 2005 increased $3.1 million to $4.1 million, from $1.0 million for 2004. The large increase in interest and investment income between 2006 and 2005 was primarily a result of a significant increase in our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances between periods, primarily the result of the cash proceeds we received from the sale of the GSS Business in December 2005. The increase in interest and investment income between 2005 and 2004 is primarily attributable to an increase in operating funds available for investment throughout the year and the interest earned during December 2005 on the cash proceeds received from the sale of the GSS Business. Income Tax Provision. The following are the key changes related to our income tax provision from continuing operations between years: For 2006, we recorded an income tax provision of $38.4 million, or an effective income tax rate of approximately 38%, compared to an income tax provision of $26.2 million, or an effective income tax rate of approximately 36% in 2005. For 2005, we recorded an income tax provision of $26.2 million, or an effective income tax rate of approximately 36%, compared to an income tax provision of $29.3 million, or an effective income tax rate of approximately 37% for 2004. For the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an effective income tax rate of approximately 42%. The higher effective income tax rate was primarily the result of a correction of minor income tax expense items from previous periods that were not considered material to the current or past periods, giving consideration to the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, and thus were recorded in their entirety in the fourth quarter. The accounting correction of these items is considered one time in nature, and is not expected to materially impact our estimated income tax rate going forward. As of December 31, 2006, our net deferred income tax assets were $28.5 million and represented approximately 4% of total assets. We continue to believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of these deferred income tax assets. Our assumptions of future profitable operations are supported by our strong operating performances over the last several years. Discontinued Operations. As discussed above, as a result of the sale of the GSS and plaNet businesses in December 2005, the GSS and plaNet businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our results of operations for all periods presented. Gain (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $(2.8) million, $6.5 million, and $(3.8) million, respectively. Discontinued operations activity for 2006 consisted of the following: During the third quarter of 2006, we made a $6.0 million payment to Comverse related to the settlement of a dispute over a joint tax election associated with the sale of our GSS Business to Comverse in December 2005. This payment was considered a reduction in the purchase price previously paid by Comverse, and thus is reflected as part of discontinued operations. This settlement payment was not anticipated, and we do not expect any similar purchase price adjustments in future periods. 33 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit from the true up of certain state income tax items related to the GSS Business. The previous accounting for these matters was appropriately based on various estimates. With the filing of the various state income tax returns during the fourth quarter, the determination of the actual benefits due is now certain. As a result of this activity, 2006 net income per diluted share was reduced by $(0.06). Discontinued operations activity for 2005 included a net pretax gain on the disposals of the GSS and plaNet businesses of $10.9 million. Liquidity Basis of Presentation. Cash flows have not been segregated between continuing operations and discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Therefore, unless indicated otherwise, all historical cash flow information presented below reflects the cash flow results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash and Liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments of $415.5 million, compared to $392.2 million as of December 31, 2005. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk, short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks. We have ready access to all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances. In addition to the above sources of liquidity, we also have a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility) with a syndicate of U.S. financial institutions that expires in September 2009. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility has a $40 million sub facility for standby and commercial letters of credit and a $10 million sub facility for same day advances. As of the date of this filing, we have made no borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to borrow under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a limitation of total indebtedness based upon the results of consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratio calculations, and a minimum liquidity requirement. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, and had the entire $100 million available to us. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. We calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, beginning with net income and then adding back the impact of non cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation, etc.), and then factoring in the impact of changes in working capital items. Our primary source of cash is from our operating activities. Our current business model consists of a significant amount of recurring revenue sources related to our long term processing arrangements (billed monthly), and software maintenance agreements (billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.) This recurring revenue base provides us with a reliable and predictable source of cash. In addition, software license fees and professional services revenues provide for material amounts of cash, but the payment streams for these items are not as predictable. The primary use of our cash is to fund our operating activities. Approximately 50% of our total operating costs relate to labor costs (both employees and contracted labor) for: (i) compensation; (ii) related fringe benefits; and (iii) reimbursements for travel and entertainment expenses. The other primary cash requirements for our operating expenses consist of: (i) postage; (ii) paper and related supplies for our statement processing centers; (iii) data processing and related services and communication lines for our service bureau processing business; and (iv) rent and related facility costs. These items are purchased under a variety of both short term and long term contractual commitments. A summary of our material contractual obligations is provided below as well. See Cash Flows From Investing Activities and Cash Flows From Financing Activities below for the other primary uses of our cash. 34 Table of Contents Our 2005 and 2006 consolidated net cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in working capital assets and liabilities, for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands): Operations Changes inWorkingCapital Assetsand Liabilities Net CashProvided byOperatingActivities Quarter Totals Cash Flows from Operating Activities: 2005: March 31(1) $ 25,147 $ (6,282 ) $ 18,865 June 30(1) 30,704 12,579 43,283 September 30 26,245 (1,533 ) 24,712 December 31(2) 29,576 (13,862 ) 15,714 Year to date total $ 111,672 $ (9,098 ) $ 102,574 2006: March 31 $ 25,872 $ (3,894 ) $ 21,978 June 30(3) 29,358 9,393 38,751 September 30 31,489 (2,937 ) 28,552 December 31 29,549 (680 ) 28,869 Year to date total $ 116,268 $ 1,882 $ 118,150 (1) Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2005 were negatively impacted by approximately $9 million due to a key client delaying payment of an invoice until after quarter end. This amount was subsequently paid in April 2005, which resulted in the payment of four monthly invoices by this client in the second quarter of 2005. The payment of the delayed invoice, along with a contract termination settlement and client bankruptcy settlement contributed approximately $12 million to our cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2005. (2) Cash flows from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2005 were negatively impacted by approximately $10 million due to a key client delaying payment of an invoice until after quarter end. Cash flows for each quarter of 2006 reflect three monthly invoice payments from this client. (3) Cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2006 were positively impacted by favorable changes in working capital items during the quarter, primarily related to the reduction in the accounts receivable balance. We believe the above table illustrates our ability to consistently generate strong quarterly and annual cash flows, and the importance of managing our working capital items, in particular, timely collections of our accounts receivable. Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities. Our billed trade accounts receivable balance includes billings for several non revenue items (primarily postage, sales tax, and deferred revenue items). As a result, we evaluate our performance in collecting our accounts receivable through our calculation of days billings outstanding (DBO) rather than a typical days sales outstanding (DSO) calculation. DBO is calculated based on the billings for the period (including non revenue items) divided by the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period. Our target range for our DBO is 55 65 days. 35 Table of Contents Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (Allowance) related to our continuing operations as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs): Gross Allowance Net Billed DBO Quarter Ended 2005: December 31 $ 106,136 $ (1,324 ) $ 104,812 61 2006: March 31 (1) 110,415 (1,008 ) 109,407 60 June 30 (2) 97,404 (1,059 ) 96,345 63 September 30 (2) 108,707 (1,143 ) 107,564 62 December 31 111,163 (1,143 ) 110,020 64 (1) The increase in both the gross and net billed trade accounts receivable between December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006 is a result of increased postage billings in the first quarter of 2006 and the timing of payments from certain clients. (2) The change in gross and net billed trade accounts receivable between March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, and September 30, 2006 relates primarily to fluctuations in the timing of invoicing and payments from certain clients at or around each quarter end. Significant fluctuations in key balance sheet items between December 31, 2006 and 2005, related to our continuing operations, that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows. Other Current Assets. The decrease in other current assets from $17.1 million as of December 31, 2005 to $5.6 million as of December 31, 2006 relates primarily to: The disposal of our corporate aircraft. As of December 31, 2005, other current assets included $7.1 million related to the carrying value of the aircraft we purchased in December 2005 in conjunction with the buyout of our lease. We sold the aircraft in January 2006; and The final purchase price for the GSS Business due from Comverse. As of December 31, 2005, other current assets included $3.8 million related to the final purchase price due from Comverse. This amount was paid by Comverse in February 2006. Deferred Income Tax Assets. The decrease in net deferred income tax assets (current and non current) from $42.8 million as of December 31, 2005 to $28.5 million as of December 31, 2006 is primarily due to the difference in tax and book amortization related to intangible assets acquired in 2006 and the interest deduction related to our Convertible Debt Securities. Accrued Employee Compensation. The decrease in accrued employee compensation from $32.4 million as of December 31, 2005 to $21.0 million as of December 31, 2006 relates primarily to the $7.6 million of retirement benefits accrued as of December 31, 2005 and paid in 2006 related to our former CEO, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the reduction in our restructuring reserves related to employee terminations that were accrued as of December 31, 2005 and paid during 2006. Deferred Revenue. The increase in deferred revenue (current and non current) from $18.5 million as of December 31, 2005 to $26.2 million as of December 31, 2006 relates primarily to the deferral of fees related to set up/implementation fees for new services for our existing clients. Such fees will be recognized as revenue over the term of the respective clients processing agreement. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes Receivable/Payable. The change from an income taxes receivable of $5.0 million as of December 31, 2005 to an income taxes payable of $3.7 million as of December 31, 2006 is due primarily to us generating Federal taxable income during 2006 and the timing of estimated Federal income tax payments. The income tax receivable recorded as of December 31, 2005 was substantially collected in the first half of 2006. Cash Flows From Investing Activities. During 2006, our cash flows from investing activities included three unique items already discussed above: (i) the $6.0 million payment made to Comverse during the third quarter of 2006 related to the sale of the GSS Business in 2005; (ii) the proceeds received from the sale of our corporate aircraft in January 2006 that was purchased in December 2005 and held for sale; and (iii) the acquisition of Telution in March 2006. Our typical investing activities consist of purchases/sales of short term investments, purchases of property and equipment, and investments in client contracts, which are discussed as follows: Purchases/Sales of Short term Investments. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk, short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks. These short term investments are readily convertible into cash. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we purchased $283.1 million, $88.1 million, and $45.1 million, respectively, and sold or had mature $156.2 million, $66.3 million, and $26.2 million, respectively, of short term investments. We continually evaluate the possible uses of our excess cash balances and will likely purchase additional short term investments in the future. Property and Equipment/Client Contracts. Our capital outlays typically relate to computer hardware and related software items, and statement production equipment. Our investment in client contracts typically consists of: (i) cash payments to clients as an incentive to bring new customers to, or retain customers on, our processing systems; and (ii) direct and incremental costs that we have capitalized related to revenue arrangements where we are required to defer conversion/set up services fees and recognize those fees as the related processing services are performed. Our annual capital expenditures for property and equipment, and investments in client contracts were as follows (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Property and equipment $ 12,651 $ 12,798 $ 9,655 Client contracts 10,658 6,060 3,466 Capital expenditures related to continuing operations during 2006, 2005, and 2004 were approximately $13 million, $7 million, and $4 million, respectively, and consisted principally of the following: (i) computer hardware and related software; (ii) statement production equipment; and (iii) facilities and internal infrastructure improvements. The increase in capital expenditures for 2006 consists principally of purchases of hardware and software infrastructure items to support many of our new products and services to meet our clients expanding business needs. While our core ACP processing product utilizes data processing capacity leased from FDC, and therefore, allowing us to avoid the large capital investment needed for such equipment, many of our new products and services ancillary to ACP (e.g., certain aspects of our WorkForce Express product, enhanced product catalog functionalities, etc.) are run on open system, computer servers (that generally interface with ACP) that we own. We expect capital expenditures will range between $15 million and $18 million for 2007. This level of capital expenditures is higher than 2006 and is another indication of the investment we are making in our business. Our 2007 capital expenditures are expected to consist principally of the following: (i) hardware and software infrastructure items to support many of our new products and services, as noted in the paragraph directly above; and (ii) investments is certain statement production equipment in order to achieve additional operational efficiencies and to offer enhanced functionalities to our clients in this area. Our investments in client contracts for the 2006, 2005, and 2004 relate primarily to direct and incremental costs incurred for conversion/set up services related to long term processing arrangements. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or for investments in client contracts. 37 Table of Contents Cash Flows From Financing Activities. We have had limited financing activities over the last several years, and historically, we have not been active in the capital markets. Our financing activities typically consist of various debt related transactions, and activities with our common stock. Long Term Debt. During the first quarter of 2004, we made a mandatory $30 million prepayment on our 2002 Credit Facility. This payment was made with the proceeds from a $34 million income tax refund received in March 2004. In June 2004, we completed our offering of the Convertible Debt Securities. We used a portion of the $230 million of proceeds from the Convertible Debt Securities to repay the outstanding balance of $198.9 million and terminate our 2002 Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Debt Securities, we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $7 million. Issuance of Common Stock. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $11.5 million, $5.3 million, and $6.9 million, respectively, and relates primarily to the exercise of stock options. Repurchase of Common Stock. As discussed above, during 2006, 2005, and 2004, we repurchased shares of our common stock under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $63.3 million, $73.0 million, and $52.9 million, respectively. In addition, outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during 2006, 2005, and 2004, we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled approximately 148,000 shares, 394,000 shares, and 174,000 shares of our common stock for $3.7 million, $8.3 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies We have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are required to be disclosed. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash (in thousands). Total Less than1 year Years23 Years4 5 More than5 Years Long term debt $ 330,625 $ 5,750 $ 11,500 $ 11,500 $ 301,875 Operating leases 44,748 7,925 14,676 10,623 11,524 Purchase obligations 112,099 40,189 58,318 13,443 149 Severance/retirement 2,555 2,555 Total $ 490,027 $ 56,419 $ 84,494 $ 35,566 $ 313,548 Our long term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The contractual obligation amount reflected for our long term debt is based upon the following assumptions: (i) our Convertible Debt Securities are outstanding through their due date of June 15, 2024; (ii) upon settlement of the Convertible Debt Securities, our cash obligation will not exceed the principal amount of the Convertible Debt Securities; and (iii) interest paid through the life of the Convertible Debt Securities at a rate of 2.5% per annum. The operating lease and severance/retirement benefits contractual obligations are discussed in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our purchase obligations consist primarily of our expected base fees under the FDC services agreement (discussed in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), data communication services, and third party software /software maintenance. 38 Table of Contents Of the total contractual obligations and commercial commitments above, approximately $238 million is reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and approximately $252 million is not. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In conjunction with the sale of the GSS and plaNet businesses in 2005, we have agreed to indemnify the buyers of the businesses against certain losses they may incur in connection with the purchased businesses subsequent to the sale dates. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of those indemnifications. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2006, we had $415.5 million of cash and short term investments available to fund our operations, and we expect to generate material amounts of additional cash during 2007. The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources: As noted above, in July 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $350 million of our outstanding common stock under our Stock Repurchase Program. In August 2006, we established a new Rule 10b5 1 Plan to facilitate the repurchase of the $350 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we have repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $42.4 million (a weighted average price of $26.90 per share) toward our planned $350 million stock repurchase amount. The number of shares repurchased under our new Rule 10b5 1 Plan is based upon predetermined factors that were established when we implemented the plan in August 2006. These factors are evaluated on a periodic basis for possible adjustment. Over time, there will likely be some variability around the number of shares repurchased due to changing market conditions, as well as the trading volume of our stock. However, we remain committed to completing the repurchase of the remaining $350 million of our outstanding common stock (which is approximately $308 million as of December 31, 2006), but the time period is now expected to extend beyond our original estimate of 12 15 months due to various market factors that have impacted the pace at which we have bought back our common stock. On March 1, 2006, we acquired Telution, Inc. We paid $20.4 million in cash (net of $1.6 million in acquired cash) at closing, and have agreed to make payments totaling $5.0 million related to various milestones associated with the integration of Telutions COMX solution with our ACP product during 2006 and 2007. During 2006, we paid $1.5 million of the $5.0 million, with the remaining $3.5 million scheduled (without contingency) to be paid out in equal quarterly installments through January 15, 2008. In addition to the cash paid at closing and the $5.0 million of integration payments, the Telution stock purchase agreement included provisions for additional purchase price payments of up to $3 million, contingent upon us signing certain revenue arrangements with certain clients. As of December 31, 2006, we have not reflected any of the $3 million in the Telution purchase price. The rights to the $3 million contingent revenue payments expire December 31, 2008. In 2006, we spent $12.7 million on capital expenditures. For 2007, we expect capital expenditures to range between $15 million and $18 million, consisting principally of hardware and software infrastructure to support our clients expanding business needs, and statement production equipment to continue to offer enhanced functionalities to our clients. As of December 31, 2006, we have made no significant capital expenditure commitments. Our Convertible Debt Securities bear interest at a rate of 2.5% per annum, which is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Debt Securities are callable by us for cash, on or after June 20, 2011. The Convertible Debt Securities can be put back to us by the holders for cash at June 15, 2011, 2016 and 2021, or upon a change of control, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Debt Securities, plus accrued interest. The Convertible Debt Securities are subject to certain conversion triggers based upon: (i) the price of our common stock; (ii) the trading price of the Convertible Debt Securities; (iii) us putting the Convertible Debt Securities back to the holders; (iv) the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, to include a change of control as defined in the Convertible Debt Securities bond indenture (the Bond Indenture); and (v) if a certain level of dividends are declared, or a certain number of shares of our common stock are repurchased under a self tender offer by us. We do not expect any of the conversion triggers to occur during the next 12 months. As a result, in the near term, we expect our annual debt service costs related to the Convertible Debt Securities to be limited to the annual interest payments of $5.8 million. 39 Table of Contents The Convertible Debt Securities are convertible into our common stock, under the specified conditions and settlement terms outlined above, at an initial conversion rate of 37.3552 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Debt Securities, which is equal to an effective conversion price of $26.77 per share. The Bond Indenture includes anti dilution provisions for the holders such that the conversion rate (and thus, the effective conversion price) can be adjusted in the future for certain events, to include stock dividends, stock splits/reverse splits, the issuance of warrants to purchase our stock at a price below the then current market price, cash dividends, and certain purchases of our common stock by us pursuant to a self tender offer or exchange offer. A lower effective conversion price may have several impacts to us, including a greater potential for: (i) the occurrence of the conversion trigger based upon the price of our common stock; and (ii) the Convertible Debt Securities having an impact on our diluted earnings per share if our average common stock price exceeds the then current effective conversion price. The repurchase of up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock, as discussed above, will have no impact on the current effective conversion price, or any other terms in the Bond Indenture. The interest rate for borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, except for same day advances, is chosen at our option and is based upon a base rate or adjusted LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. The base rate represents the higher of a floating prime rate and a floating rate equal to 50 basis points in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The interest rate for same day advances is based upon base rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are dependent on our leverage ratio, as defined, and range from zero to 100 basis points for base rate loans and 125 to 225 basis points for LIBOR loans. As of December 31, 2006, we had made no borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. We pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. This rate is dependent on our leverage ratio and ranges from 25 to 50 basis points per annum. As of December 31, 2006, the commitment fee rate was 37.5 basis points per annum. As of December 31, 2006, we had 100%, or $100 million, of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility available to us. In summary, we expect to continue to repurchase our outstanding common stock under our Stock Repurchase Program. We also expect to continue to make investments in client contracts, capital equipment, and R&D. In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we are continually evaluating potential business and asset acquisitions, and investments in market share expansion with our existing and potential new clients. We believe that: (i) our current cash and short term investments balance, together with cash expected to be generated from future operating activities (including the impact of our plan to complete the remaining amount of our stock repurchase commitment of approximately $308 million); (ii) the amount available under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility; and (iii) other possible sources of additional debt are available to us, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing fixed charges into earnings. Earnings is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest expense (including the amortization of deferred financing costs) and the estimated interest component of rental expense. Our consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 2006, was 10.37:1.00. See Exhibit 12.10 to this document for information regarding the calculation of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. As of December 31, 2006, we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates, and fluctuations and changes in the market value of our short term investments. We have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Market Risk Related to Long Term Debt. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to long term debt from two sources: our Convertible Debt Securities, and our 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Convertible Debt Securities is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our borrowings under the Convertible Debt Securities, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates. Commencing with the six month period 40 Table of Contents beginning June 15, 2011, in any six month interest period where the average trading price of the Convertible Debt Securities immediately preceding that six month interest period equals 120% or more of the principal amount of the Convertible Debt Securities, we will pay contingent interest equal to 0.25% of that average trading price. The interest rate for borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, except for same day advances, is chosen at our option, and is based upon a base rate or adjusted LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. The base rate represents the higher of a floating prime rate and a floating rate equal to 50 basis points in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The interest rate for same day advances is based upon base rate, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins are dependent on our leverage ratio, as defined, and range from zero to 100 basis points for base rate loans and 125 to 225 basis points for LIBOR loans. As of December 31, 2006 we had made no borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our long term debt. Market Risk Related to Cash Equivalents and Short term Investments. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $240.7 million and $346.1 million, respectively. Our cash balances are typically swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short term investments. We have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments. Our short term investments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $174.8 million and $46.1 million, respectively. The day to day management of our cash equivalents and short term investments is performed by two large financial institutions in the U.S., using strict and formal investment guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. Under these guidelines, short term investments are limited to certain acceptable investments with: (i) a maximum maturity, (ii) a maximum concentration and diversification; and (iii) a minimum acceptable credit quality. We do not utilize any derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing our market risks related to interest rate risk. 41 Table of Contents
