OVERVIEW Essex provides advanced technology solutions primarily for U.S. Government intelligence and defense customers. Our solutions include advanced signal processing, image processing, information processing, information assurance and engineering innovations. We create our solutions by integrating our services and expertise with hardware, software, and our proprietary and patented technology to meet our customers requirements. We have expanded our capabilities, customer set, and technologies through the integration of several strategic acquisitions. Our ability to directly integrate essential technologies into innovative solutions is an important differentiator for Essex with its customers. During the first quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of the Annapolis, Maryland based Windermere. The Windermere acquisition adds breadth and depth to Essexs existing technical capabilities and to its intelligence community customer set. In addition, Windermere adds information assurance and engineering innovations to the range of intelligence technologies we offer. Our awards with the U.S. Government generally extend over multiple years. Most of our contracts are classified. Within the intelligence and defense communities, we have established and maintained long standing and successful customer relationships. We are also developing next generation signal, image and information processing , information assurance and engineering innovations solutions under classified U.S. Government research and development contracts. We have been able to develop our current proprietary technology using a combination of government funding and our own internal funding and we believe this combination should allow us to continue to enhance and expand our technology and services for future market needs. Essex is also expanding its ability to create products from its technologies for both government and commercial applications. 30 Table of Contents While we have primarily marketed our services and products to the intelligence and defense markets, we believe we are also well positioned to apply our solutions to growth areas within the commercial market. Historically, our proprietary technology and products, although critical to our solutions offerings, have not accounted for a significant portion of our revenues on a stand alone basis. Most of our revenues are derived from awards with the U.S. Government, where we are either the prime contractor or a subcontractor, depending on the award. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, revenues derived from the U.S. Government programs were $153.8 million, or 96%, and $68.3 million, or 97%, of our total revenues, respectively. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, revenues from our largest customer were $109.9 million, or 69% of the Companys revenues. On certain projects, our customers require us to purchase and provide the materials portion (which may include hardware, software and firmware) of the total system solution, which entails our purchasing materials from third party vendors and reselling it to our customers. We show revenues and costs from purchased materials separately since these revenues carry significantly lower margins than our products and services revenues. The purchased materials revenues are highly variable from period to period. Our most significant expenses are cost of goods sold and services provided, which consist primarily of direct labor and associated costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete projects, including the cost of materials and equipment and amounts paid or accrued to subcontractors. Our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements, salaries and other costs, as well as to manage personnel levels and utilize our personnel versus subcontracting the work, can have a significant impact on our cost of goods sold and services provided. Utilizing our own employees on projects results in higher gross margins compared to utilizing subcontracted employees for the same work. As a result, we seek to maximize our internal labor content on our awards. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our management, facilities, finance and administrative groups and business development expenses which include bid and proposal efforts, and occupancy, travel and other corporate costs. We have revenues from some awards on which our U.S. Government customers pay us to perform research and development on their behalf. We also spend funds on internal research and development, which are separately classified as such in the financial statements. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset as it had a history of net operating losses. Based on current and expected future operating results, the Company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, the Company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate, reduced by any estimated research and development credit, in future periods. The Company has engaged an outside consultant to study its methodology for determining research and development credit eligible costs. The effect, if any, of a change in methodology will be reflected in its 2006 tax provision. On April 30, 2004, we acquired 100% of the common stock of Computer Science Innovations, Inc., or CSI, which is headquartered in Melbourne, Florida, for approximately $8.1 million in cash. CSI has proprietary techniques, algorithms and tools that are used to build custom cognitive engines for a broad range of intelligence, defense and commercial customers and applications. Cognitive engines are software that includes predictive models and classifiers, and our applications include the areas of fraud and anomaly detection, image and signal recognition, information integration, knowledge management, network information assurance, semantic processing and waveform analysis. CSI had revenues of approximately $7.6 million in its fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the last full year prior to acquisition. On June 25, 2004, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Performance Group, Inc., or PGI, with main offices in Fredericksburg, Virginia, for approximately $5.8 million in cash and $362,000 in assumed liabilities. PGI provides services and systems in the areas of geographic information systems, or GIS, image processing and analysis, spatial data development, environmental consulting, visualization, and IT solutions to government and private sector clients. PGI had revenue of approximately $4.5 million for calendar year ended 2003, the last full year prior to acquisition. 31 Table of Contents On February 28, 2005, we acquired 100% of the ownership and membership interests of Windermere for a total initial purchase price of $72.0 million, including the initial payment of $69.4 million and legal and other fees of $2.6 million. The acquisition agreement for the Windermere transaction contains earn out provisions that may require us to make an additional purchase price payment on May 31, 2006, to be calculated based on excess earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of Windermere during the applicable earn out period. Under the Windermere earn out arrangement, the Companys aggregate contingent earn out obligation may range from a low of zero dollars to a maximum of $30.0 million in cash, and associated fees, depending upon the extent to which Windermeres EBITDA during the period March 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006 exceeds the EBITDA target of $5.5 million for such period established and defined in the acquisition agreement. We are not yet able to determine the extent to which earn out amounts may become payable under this agreement. We expect to enter into discussions with the Windermere sellers regarding the earn out by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Pursuant to an oral agreement between Stephen E. Tate, who became an Executive Vice President of Essex upon the Windermere acquisition, and Essex, Essex paid Stephen E. Tate a $1.7 million finders fee in connection with the Windermere acquisition. To the extent any earn out is payable to the sellers in connection with the acquisition of Windermere, the Company will be obligated to pay Stephen E. Tate an additional fee equal to 2.5% multiplied by such earn out amount, up to a maximum $750,000. An additional 1% finders fee is also due to an individual who is neither affiliated with nor employed by Essex. To the extent significant earn out amounts become payable, we expect to pay such amounts from cash balances then existing, and if such cash balances are not sufficient to fund the payments, we will likely fund the payments through borrowings under our credit facility or sales of common stock under our shelf registration, or both. Windermere provides engineering innovations, information assurance and information technology solutions primarily to government agencies and the intelligence community. Windermere had revenues of $64.7 million, including $2.5 million of revenue from discontinued operations, for the calendar year ended December 31, 2004. As disclosed in our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the three month periods ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005, we identified certain material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting of our recently acquired Windermere subsidiary. Those weaknesses, which we believe are not unusual for a privately held company of the size of Windermere, included a lack of segregation of duties of financial personnel and inadequate financial management systems. In light of those weaknesses, in an effort to remediate and integrate Windermeres internal controls, we made certain organizational and personnel changes in the period ended December 31, 2005. These included altering the organizational structure of Windermere, evaluating and planning training programs for financial management personnel, hiring new financial personnel, and changing reporting structures in a manner designed to provide more direct reporting from Windermere financial personnel to Essex financial personnel. We believe these have resulted in an overall improvement in the internal controls over financial reporting for Windermere. We also believe additional remediation is necessary. For instance, budgetary analysis and processes at Windermere require further strengthening and refinement to be better integrated with, and to be brought up to, overall industry standards to which we adhere. In February 2006, we implemented a new general ledger and budgetary system company wide. We expect additional improvements in Windermeres internal controls over financial reporting will be made as the financial personnel training programs progress and financial policies and procedures are adopted company wide. We expect that these measures will be implemented in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006. In addition, we undertook additional review procedures to assure that the financial statements for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005 are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. During the second quarter of 2005, we created the Commercial Communications Products Division (CCPD) to develop and sell fiber optic modules and subsystems for advanced communications applications to both commercial and government markets. CCPD designs, manufactures, integrates and tests our communication products, which include the 80km and extended range XFP Transceivers, DuoBinary 300 pin MSA Transponders, and Microwave Transceiver Assemblies (MTA). Production of the MTA began in December 2005 and, subject to the results of testing and certification, availability of production units for the XFP Transceivers 32 Table of Contents and DuoBinary Transponders is planned for early in the third quarter of 2006. In 2005, less than 1% of our total revenues were derived from CCPD. While the initial CCPD operating costs and the research and development investment impacted our 2005 earnings, we expect an improvement in 2006 as the product orders are completed. CCPD operates within the Commercial Products Group organization of Essex, which has the charter to create innovative solutions to satisfy customer and market needs, to evaluate and select innovations for productization and to manage the productization, marketing and sales of Essex products to both commercial and government customers at commercial product rates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we re evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, research and development, intangible assets and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates are used when accounting for uncollectible accounts receivable, depreciation and amortization, intangible assets, goodwill, and employee benefit plans and contingencies, among others. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Revenue Recognition We enter into the following types of U.S. Government agreements: Time and material. On time and material agreements, revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates multiplied by hours delivered, plus other direct costs. Cost plus fee. We recognize revenue on cost plus fee arrangements to the extent costs are incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned. We must determine that the costs incurred are proper and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the expected funding on the project and still deliver the scope of work proposed. Even though cost plus fee arrangements generally do not require that we expend costs in excess of the award value, such expenditures may be required in order to achieve customer satisfaction and receive additional work. In addition, since the reimbursable costs include both direct and indirect costs, we must determine that the indirect costs are properly accounted for and allocated in accordance with reasonable cost allocation methods. Fixed price. On fixed price agreements, we must determine that the costs incurred provide a proportionate amount of progress on the work and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the funding on the award for the required services or product to be delivered. Award or incentive fees may be received in lieu of, or in addition to, other fees on time and material or cost plus fee contracts. Where award or incentive fees are applicable, we record as revenues an estimate of the expected award or incentive fee proportionate to the work performed. Estimated fee is based on our experience under the contract or similar contracts and on on going communication with the client regarding performance. 33 Table of Contents We use historical technical performance experience where applicable to evaluate progress on fixed price and cost plus fee jobs. We use historical government audit experience in the indirect cost area to evaluate the propriety and expected recovery of our indirect costs on cost plus fee agreements. The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues under each type of contract for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004 and December 28, 2003: Percentage of Revenues byContract Type Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31,2005 Dec. 31,2004 Dec. 28,2003 Time and material 58 % 88 % 57 % Cost plus fixed fee 19 10 27 Cost plus incentive fee 16 Fixed price 7 2 16 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The change for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 is principally attributable to the contract mix of the revenue associated with the Windermere acquisition which was more heavily weighted toward cost plus contracts. Costs of Goods Sold and Services Provided Our costs are categorized as either direct or indirect costs. Direct costs are those that can be identified with and allocated to specific contracts and tasks. They include labor, fringe (for example, leave time, medical/dental, retirement plan, payroll taxes, employee welfare, workers compensation and other benefits), subcontractor costs, consultant fees, travel expenses, materials and equipment. Indirect costs are either overhead or general and administrative expenses. Indirect costs cannot generally be identified with specific contracts or tasks, and to the extent that they are allowable, they are allocated to contracts and tasks using appropriate government approved methodologies. Costs determined to be unallowable under the Federal Acquisition Regulations cannot be allocated to projects. Our principal unallowable costs are interest expense, amortization expense for separately identified intangibles from acquisitions, certain general and administrative expenses, financing and merger/acquisition costs. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Such costs include direct labor and materials as well as a reasonable allocation of overhead costs. However, no general and administrative costs are included. Equipment which has alternative future uses is capitalized and charged to expense over its estimated useful life. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired using the purchase method of accounting. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in a combination with contracts or assets. We have adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142 which requires that we, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. Managements judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units. Because of the integral technologies and operations of the acquisitions to date, we have determined that Essex has only one corporate wide reporting entity to which this test applies. Intangibles are amortized over their estimated life, not exceeding five years. 34 Table of Contents Stock Options In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be valued at fair value on the grant date and be expensed over the applicable vesting period. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the Company on January 1, 2006. The Company will transition to SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application. Under the modified prospective application, compensation costs will be recognized in the financial statements for all new share based payments granted after January 1, 2006. Additionally, the Company will recognize compensation costs for the portion of previously granted awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered (nonvested awards) that are outstanding as of January 1, 2006 over the remaining requisite service period of the awards. The compensation expense to be recognized for the nonvested awards will be based on the fair value of the awards. Our adoption of SFAS No. 123R will adversely affect our Financial Position and Results of Operations in future periods. At December 31, 2005, the total value of options outstanding and vesting after January 1, 2006 is expected to be approximately $429,000, with $369,000 (before the consideration of income taxes, if any) vesting in the year ending December 31, 2006. Income Taxes Until the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company was providing a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. Based upon a review of a number of factors, including the Companys recent historical operating performance and its expectation that it can generate consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future, the Company reversed in the fourth quarter of 2005 substantially all, or approximately $5.6 million, of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. As a result of the valuation allowance reversal, the Company recognized a non cash tax benefit of $3.5 million as part of the deferred income tax provision. Also, as a result of the valuation allowance reversal, the Company recognized a non cash tax benefit of $1.5 million as an increase in additional paid in capital to reflect the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation and $570,000 was recognized as a reduction to goodwill for net deferred tax assets from acquisitions in prior years. Furthermore, the Company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate, reduced by any estimated research and development credit, in future periods. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $66,000 and $10,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. As stated above, the 2005 deferred tax provision is net of a $3.5 million beneficial change in valuation allowance. We recorded a current provision for state income taxes of $83,000 in the year ended December 31, 2005 for state and local income taxes where net operating loss carryforwards are not available to offset current taxable income. We also recorded a current provision for federal income taxes of $97,000 in the year ended December 31, 2005 for alternative minimum tax (AMT) due to the limitation under the AMT rules on the use of net operating loss carryforwards. The 2004 provision relates entirely to current state income tax in jurisdictions where the Company did not have net operating loss carryforwards offset by valuation allowance. Business Combination We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date. The purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period, but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date. External costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations, while internal costs incurred by us for acquisition opportunities are expensed. 35 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with or through any unconsolidated entity or which have not been recognized and disclosed in these financial statements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for each period indicated, the percentage of items in the statement of operations in relation to revenue. Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31,2005 Dec. 31,2004 Dec. 28,2003 Revenues: Services and products 84.8 % 78.6 % 100.0 % Purchased materials 15.2 21.4 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Costs of goods sold and services provided (72.6 ) (79.2 ) (63.8 ) Gross margin 27.4 20.8 36.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses (18.8 ) (15.8 ) (30.1 ) Research and development expenses (1.8 ) (1.5 ) (2.5 ) Amortization of other intangible assets (2.2 ) (0.7 ) (2.3 ) Operating income 4.6 2.8 1.3 Interest/dividend income (expense), net 0.8 0.4 (0.4 ) Income before income taxes 5.4 3.2 0.9 Provision for income taxes (0.1 ) Net income 5.3 % 3.2 % 0.9 % The following table sets forth, for each component of our revenues, the related gross margin provided expressed as a percentage of the related revenues for the periods indicated. Dec. 31,2005 Dec. 31,2004 Dec. 28,2003 Gross Margin by Revenue Type: Services and products 31.1 % 25.6 % 36.2 % Purchased materials (1) 6.9 % 3.2 % % (1) 2003 had no comparable purchases to 2004 and 2005 Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues. Our revenues were $159.8 million and $70.5 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues increased as a result of both acquisition and internal growth. With regard to acquisition revenues, revenues include ten months of results from Windermere. In the last full year of operations prior to the acquisition, Windermere reported $64.7 million (less $2.5 million from a unit that was not acquired). The internal growth results primarily from our Thunder contract and growth on the Woodstock contract that exceeded historical performance levels occurring prior to acquisition. We expect our revenues in 2006 to continue to be primarily from U.S. Government contracts. Revenue from material purchases increased by $9.2 million. Revenue from purchased materials declined as a percentage of total revenue from 21% of the total in fiscal 2004 to 15% in fiscal 2005. As we have previously discussed, purchased materials are hardware, software, and firmware acquired as part of our total solution 36 Table of Contents offering to our clients. Purchased material can fluctuate significantly from period to period and generally carry a very low margin. Costs of Goods Sold and Services Provided (CGS). Total CGS increased $60.2 million to $116.0 million in fiscal 2005 from $55.8 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of increased revenues volume at improved gross margins. As a percentage of total revenues, total CGS was approximately 72.6% for fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 79.2% for fiscal 2004. For services and products revenue, CGS was 68.9% for fiscal 2005 as compared to 74.4% for fiscal 2004. The improved margins are primarily a result of better margins on our Thunder contract as we continued to increase the number of Essex personnel, instead of lower margin subcontract personnel, working on the job and as we began performing the contract in our Essex facility. We anticipate that the gradual shift of this work to our personnel to continue over time. In addition, services and products margins from contracts acquired through the Windermere acquisition exceeded the 2004 margins, further contributing to the improvement. Furthermore, margins improved on our purchased materials as a result of certain contractual changes and our acquisition of Windermere, which has contracts with higher margins for such materials. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A). Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.1 million to $30.2 million for fiscal 2005 from $11.1 million for fiscal 2004. SG&A costs have increased as the volume of business has increased through internal and acquisition growth. SG&A increased as a percentage of revenues from 15.8% of revenues in 2004 to 18.8% of revenues for 2005 due to the increase in facilities costs to support general corporate needs as well as the expansion of our facilities under our Thunder contract, increased business development costs, and additional labor and infrastructure costs to support our growth, as well as, costs associated with Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Research and Development Expenses (R&D). Research and development expenses increased $1.8 million to $2.8 million for fiscal 2005 from $1.0 million in fiscal 2004. The increase primarily reflects continued investment in our cognitive systems and in our optical communications and signal processing technologies. This includes our optical encryptor, as well as communications technologies of our recently formed Commercial Communication Products Division. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. During fiscal 2005, amortization of other intangible assets was $3.5 million compared to $523,000 in fiscal 2004. This increase resulted from the amortization of customer contracts receivables and other intangibles associated with the Windermere acquisition that occurred in February 2005. Amortization of existing intangibles is expected to decline to approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2006. Net Interest/Dividend Income (Expense). Net interest/dividend income was $1.3 million in fiscal 2005 compared to net interest/dividend income of $332,000 in fiscal 2004. The increase in net interest/dividend income reflects the temporary investment of the proceeds from our 2004 stock offering as well as $285,000 in interest on a $25 million loan to Windermere prior to its purchase by Essex. Net Income. Net income was $8.6 million and $2.3 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax provision of $66,000 and $10,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 deferred tax provision is net of a $3.5 million beneficial change in valuation allowance. The Company continues to have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset current federal and state income tax. We recognized a provision for current federal income taxes of $97,000 in 2005 and current state income taxes of $83,000 and $10,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively where our net operating loss is limited or not available or where we are subject to the alternative minimum tax. The Company expects to accrue income tax at approximately the statutory effective rate, reduced by any estimated research and development credit, in future periods. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2003 Revenues. Our revenues were $70.5 million and $16.3 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The key factors for the higher revenues were the increased activity on our Thunder contract award and a January 2004 37 Table of Contents $4.5 million (increased in the third quarter of 2004 to $6.2 million) two year award for software and systems engineering and the delivery of custom systems to national priority programs. Revenues from these two awards in fiscal 2004 were $45.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Of this total of $48.6 million, $15.0 million was for purchased materials. There was no comparable purchased material in 2003. Costs of Goods Sold and Services Provided (CGS). Total CGS increased $45.4 million to $55.8 million in fiscal 2004 from $10.4 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of total revenues, total CGS was approximately 79.2% for fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 63.8% for fiscal 2003. For services and products revenue, CGS was 74.4% for fiscal 2004 as compared to 63.8% for fiscal 2003. The increase in CGS in 2004 reflects increased volume and revenues for the period. The increase in CGS as a percentage of revenues in 2004 reflects the change in the mix of work, primarily related to the two contracts discussed under revenues immediately above. Specifically, upon award and ramp up, a majority of the revenues under those contracts relate to subcontracts and purchased materials which are at a lower margin. For purchased materials revenues, CGS was 96.8% in fiscal 2004, and there were no comparable purchases in fiscal 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A). Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.2 million to $11.1 million for fiscal 2004 from $4.9 million for fiscal 2003. SG&A costs have increased as the volume of business has increased through internal and acquisition growth. SG&A decreased as a percentage of revenues from 30.1% of revenues in 2003 to 15.8% of revenues for 2004. Research and Development Expenses (R&D). Research and development expenses increased $635,000 to $1.0 million for fiscal 2004 from $403,000 in fiscal 2003. We incurred the majority of our research and development on efforts related to optical communications technology and have incurred R&D since May 2004 in the newly acquired CSI operation. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. During fiscal 2004, amortization of other intangible assets was $523,000, which was primarily related to the CSI and PGI acquisitions. There was $381,000 of amortization costs in the comparable period in 2003 relating to the SDL acquisition. The remaining balance of $36,000 of other intangible assets was fully amortized during the first and second quarters of 2004. We had no amortization cost in fiscal 2002. Net Interest/Dividend Income (Expense). Net interest/dividend income was $332,000 in fiscal 2004 compared to net interest/dividend expense of $68,000 in the comparable period of 2003. The net interest/dividend income reflects the temporary investment of the proceeds from our 2003 and 2004 stock offerings. Net Income. Net income was $2.3 million and $140,000 in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. We were in a net operating loss carry forward position for book and tax purposes and maintained a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We recognized a current provision for state income taxes in 2004 of $10,000 where our net operating loss was not available. Backlog Our awards with the U.S. Government generally extend over multiple years. Funded backlog generally consists of the sum of all awarded amounts of work for which funding has been approved and awards granted, less the value of work performed under such awards. Since the U.S. Government operates under annual appropriations, our customers typically fund awards on an incremental basis, generally for periods of one year or less. In many cases, our awards include unexercised options. Accordingly, a significant amount of our backlog is unfunded. We include in unfunded backlog the total value of signed contracts, less funding to date. Unfunded backlog includes awarded options based upon expected performance levels for those options. Unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts beyond the current level of effort being performed under those contracts. As of December 31, 2005, we had total backlog, funded and unfunded, of $499.2 million as compared with $230.8 million at December 31, 2004. Of these amounts, funded backlog was $90.5 million and unfunded 38 Table of Contents backlog was $408.7 million at fiscal year end December 31, 2005 compared to $29.7 million and $201.1 million, respectively, at fiscal year end 2004. Unfunded backlog at December 31, 2005 includes the remaining balance of $103.7 million on our Thunder contract. At December 31, 2004 unfunded backlog on this contract was $170.0 million. Unfunded backlog at December 31, 2005 also includes the remaining balance of $163.2 million on our Woodstock contract. In addition to priced options through September 2009, the Woodstock contract includes an annual option to double the value of each annual contract option. The customer exercised and funded that option in 2005 and based on the 2006 tasks proposed to date, we expect that the customer will continue to exercise that doubling option. As a result, we include these options through the contract period in unfunded backlog. Unfunded backlog at December 31, 2005 also includes $39.1 million from of our $46.0 million Cougar contract awarded in December 2005. Both Windermere and Essex are subcontractors on a single contract, referred to as Jackhammer, to provide communication systems support to the intelligence community through 2011. The total contract value of both subcontracts is $51.0 million, which includes a recent increase of $5.2 million. The total unfunded backlog for both subcontracts at December 31, 2005 was $23.4 million. Unfunded backlog for the Essex subcontract was $19.2 million at December 31, 2004. Our total backlog has increased significantly during 2005 from $230.8 million at December 31, 2004 to $499.2 million at December 31, 2005 primarily due to the contracts acquired in the Windermere acquisition, the award of the Cougar contract, and growth in our Woodstock contract. We currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal year 2006 from approximately 35% of our total backlog as of December 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that we will receive amounts included in our backlog or that monies will be appropriated by Congress or otherwise made available to finance contracts and task orders included in our backlog. Many factors that affect the scheduling of projects could alter the actual timing of revenue on projects included in backlog. There is always the possibility that the contracts could be adjusted or cancelled. We adjust our backlog on a quarterly basis to reflect modifications to or renewals of existing contracts, awards of new contracts or approvals of expenditures. Net Operating Loss Carry Forward The Companys net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2005 includes federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $9.2 million. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its net deferred tax asset based upon a review of a number of factors, including the Companys recent historical operating performance and its expectation that it can generate consolidated taxable income for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company reversed substantially all of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets, including its NOL, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations and to make capital expenditures and acquisitions. A significant part of our business strategy is to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions and we used a substantial portion of our cash balance at fiscal year end 2004 for the acquisition of Windermere. The acquisition agreement for the Windermere transaction contains earn out provisions that may require us to make an additional purchase price payment on May 31, 2006, to be calculated based on excess earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of Windermere during the applicable earn out period. Under the Windermere earn out arrangement, the Companys aggregate contingent earn out obligation may range from a low of zero dollars to a maximum of $30.0 million in cash, and associated fees, depending upon the extent to which Windermeres EBITDA during the period March 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006 exceeds the EBITDA target of $5.5 million for such period established and defined in the acquisition agreement. We are not 39 Table of Contents yet able to determine the extent to which earn out amounts may become payable under this agreement. We expect to enter into discussions with the Windermere sellers regarding the earn out by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Pursuant to an oral agreement between Stephen E. Tate, who became an Executive Vice President of Essex upon the Windermere acquisition, and Essex, Essex paid Stephen E. Tate a $1.7 million finders fee in connection with the Windermere acquisition. To the extent any earn out is payable to the sellers in connection with the acquisition of Windermere, the Company will be obligated to pay Stephen E. Tate an additional fee equal to 2.5% multiplied by such earn out amount, up to a maximum $750,000. An additional 1% finders fee is also due to an individual who is neither affiliated with nor employed by Essex. If amounts become payable under the earn out arrangement, or if additional amounts become payable under the finders fee arrangements described above, appropriate increases will be made to Goodwill associated with the acquisition. For fiscal year 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 million, a significant improvement from 2004 where cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million and 2003 where cash used in operations was $228,000. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2005 was from net income and non cash depreciation, amortization and other charges of approximately $14.6 million offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable, net of the change in other liabilities of $4.9 million. Accounts receivable increased during fiscal year 2005 primarily due to ramp up on acquired contracts, subcontractor accruals, and award fees to be billed. In 2006, we anticipate that contractual and process improvements will reduce our days sales outstanding in our receivables, improving our cash position as the year progresses. For fiscal year 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $82.1 million, of which $72.0 million, net of cash acquired in the acquisition, was for the acquisition of Windermere. We also expended $10.2 million for property, equipment and leasehold improvements to support our growing work force. Our working capital at December 31, 2005 decreased to $48.1 million from $108.4 million at fiscal year end 2004. The decrease was primarily a result of the acquisition of Windermere for cash. We anticipate continued investment in infrastructure in 2006 as we continue to support our growing workforce and as we expand our facilities to support our Thunder, Woodstock, and Cougar contracts. For fiscal year 2005, net cash used in financing activities was $5.1 million which primarily represented the cash pay down of the acquired Windermere line of credit to reduce interest expense, offset by increased stock option exercises. On July 11, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective our equity shelf registration statement on Form S 3 relating to one or more future offerings of up to an aggregate of $100 million of our common stock. We believe the shelf registration statement will provide us with more efficient and immediate access to capital markets when considered appropriate. Our board of directors has authorized management to pursue an underwritten public offering of up to $100 million in our common stock under the shelf registration statement. As of March 15, 2006, we have not issued any securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement. On June 30, 2005, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into the Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. The Companys obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries except patents and have a maturity date of June 30, 2008. Under the Credit Facility, the bank has committed, subject to customary conditions precedent, to provide advances and letters of credit of up to $20.0 million, with guidance line advances of up to an additional $20.0 million at the banks discretion. The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, with which the Company was in compliance as of March 15, 2006. There were no borrowings outstanding under this Credit Facility as of March 15, 2006. The Company expects to satisfy its operating cash requirements for 2006 from its projected positive operating cash flows and existing cash balance. To the extent that future acquisitions, capital requirements, or 40 Table of Contents any potential earn out payment under the Windermere purchase agreement and related finders fee obligations require cash beyond our expected positive cash flows and existing cash balance over the next twelve months, the Company may utilize its Credit Facility with the bank or proceeds from the offering under the shelf registration, if consummated, or both. There can be no assurance that the Company will, or based on market factors or business activities that the Company will be able to, issue shares under the shelf registration statement or otherwise obtain financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Inflation Because of the Companys substantial activities in professional services and product development, the Company is more labor intensive than firms involved primarily in industrial activities. To attract and maintain higher caliber professional staff, the Company must structure its compensation programs competitively. The wage demand effect of inflation is felt almost immediately in the Companys costs; however, the net effect during the periods presented is minimal. First, the inflation rate in the United States generally has little impact on the Companys cost reimbursable type contracts and other short term contracts. Second, for longer term, fixed price and time and material type contracts, the Company endeavors to protect its margins by including cost escalation provisions or other specific inflation protective terms in these contracts. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual Cash Obligations Our contractual cash obligations increased to $22.2 million at December 31, 2005 from $13.4 million at December 31, 2004 due principally to Windermere operating leases acquired as part of the acquisition of Windermere on February 28, 2005, net of payments made during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005. The following table shows, for each period indicated, our contractual obligations. We have no contractual cash obligations due after 2013. 2006 2007 2008 2009 20102013 (In thousands) Operating leases $ 4,738 $ 4,722 $ 3,970 $ 2,673 $ 5,773 Capital leases, including interest 37 37 19 Total $ 4,775 $ 4,759 $ 3,989 $ 2,673 $ 5,773 The Company entered into leases for production and office space in Maryland in connection with the work on its largest program. The leases are for seven years ending approximately April 2011 and total rent is approximately $6.3 million. The leases contain normal clauses for payment of operating, real estate and common area maintenance over base year amounts and provide for a one time option to terminate the leases after 4 years from the commencement date of the respective lease. In February 2006, we signed a lease to expand this facility by approximately 26,000 square feet. In connection with these leases, the Company provided approximately $3 million to the landlord to finance special security related leasehold improvements. The Company has recorded a note receivable in connection with the lease as the landlord is repaying the funds over 39 months at 7% interest. Prior to our acquisition of Windermere, Windermere leased certain office facilities from an entity in which certain members of the sellers had significant interests. As part of the acquisition agreement, Essex leased the facility from an entity in which a current non executive employee has an ownership interest. In addition, Stephen E. Tate, an Executive Vice President of Essex, is the son of Raymond T. Tate, who until December 31, 2005 was the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Windermere, is the brother of three of the members of the entity, but does not have a direct ownership interest in the entity. The lease is for 68,853 square feet and runs through February 28, 2009. The annual rent is approximately $900,000 through 2008 and $150,000 41 Table of Contents in 2009. In 2005, the Company paid approximately $703,000 for the 10 months of occupancy since acquisition. The total rent obligation is approximately $2.8 million and is included in our contractual cash obligations. The Company has several other office facilities under long term leases which expire in 2013. The leases contain provisions to pay for proportionate increases in operating costs and property taxes. In addition, facilities leases often include a provision to remove, at the option of the landlord, any security related leasehold improvements. Because the Company currently considers such an option unlikely due to the dearth of such space, no provision has been made in the financial statements for this contingency. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has no variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates on our cash investments. At December 31, 2005, such cash investments were $19.4 million and averaged $18.5 million during the year. Presently, such cash investments earn approximately 4% per annum. Based upon our cash investments for fiscal 2005, a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would have increased or decreased income by $10,000 for every $1.0 million invested and would have increased or decreased our annual cash flow and interest income by a comparable amount.
