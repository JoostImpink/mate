Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of the results of operations for 2006 compared with 2005 and 2005 compared with 2004, and changes in financial condition during 2006. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December and included 52 weeks during 2006 as compared with 53 weeks in 2005 and 52 weeks in 2004. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information provided in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Companys primary means of distributing its product is through independent sales organizations and individuals, which are also its customers. The majority of the Companys products are in turn sold to end customers who are not members of the Companys sales forces. The Company is largely dependent upon these independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the Company and its ability to generate sales, earnings and operating cash flows. The Companys primary business drivers are the size, activity and productivity of its independent sales organizations. Estimates included herein are those of the Companys management and are subject to the disclosure in the Forward Looking Statements section at the end of this Item 7. 17 Table of Contents Overview 52 weeksendedDec. 30,2006 53 weeksendedDec. 31,2005 Change Changeexcludingforeignexchange Foreignexchangeimpact Net sales $1,743.7 $1,279.3 36.3% 35.6% $8.5 Gross margin 64.7% 64.3% 0.4pp 0.2pp 0.2pp Delivery, sales & administrative as percent of sales 56.3 54.6 1.7 1.9 (0.2) Operating income $152.2 $110.1 38.2% 35.3% $1.4 Net income 94.1 85.4 10.2 9.2 1.1 The 2006 sales increase reflected $458.9 more sales from the Acquired Units than in 2005 when they were only included in the Companys results following their December 5, 2005 acquisition. Total 2006 sales by the Acquired Units were $496.7 million. There was also a net increase from the Tupperware units in Asia Pacific and North America, which includes Tupperware Mexico, and BeautiControl North America. Sales in Europe were up, from the benefit of including the South African beauty units in the segment, which did not have sales for the first eleven months of 2005 prior to their acquisition. For the year, net income was up primarily due to the full year inclusion of the Acquired Units, which generated $33.1 million in profit, or $57.5 million before considering amortization of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting, compared with $2.2 million in 2005 for the one month they were owned by the Company. Profit also improved in the Tupperware units in Asia Pacific; there was a significantly lower loss by Tupperware United States and Canada, and a small improvement in profit by BeautiControl North America. Also impacting the comparison was $23.7 million of amortization of purchase accounting intangibles in 2006 versus $1.7 million in 2005, higher unallocated corporate expenses, lower re engineering and impairment charges, and a large, favorable 2005 tax related settlement with the Companys former parent. Net interest expense did not change significantly, reflecting higher ongoing expense in 2006 associated with higher average borrowings and costs in 2005 associated with changes in the Companys debt financing, both in connection with the Acquisition. The higher unallocated corporate expenses in 2006 were due to higher public relations costs in an effort to contemporize the Companys brand perception, increased equity compensation and a net loss from foreign exchange versus net gains in 2005. In 2006, the Company generated cash flow from operating activities of $172.8 million. The year end debt to total capital ratio was 63 percent compared with 69 percent last year. In 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) Share Based Payment in 2006, which requires the Company to record compensation expense for all unvested options that were issued prior to the Companys adoption of fair value accounting. These options were not previously considered under the Companys decision to adopt fair value accounting prospectively in 2003. This change resulted in $0.8 million of incremental expense in 2006. Additionally, 2006 included an incremental $1.5 million of compensation expense related to clarification from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding accounting for stock options granted to retiree eligible participants (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). This change did not impact the total compensation cost to be recognized but did accelerate it. Net sales increased four percent in 2005 versus 2004, both as reported and in local currency. Three percentage points of the increase reflected the inclusion of the Acquired Units results for one month in 2005. BeautiControl North America achieved a strong sales increase, which was mostly offset by a decrease in Tupperware North America coming from the United States business. Net income was down two percent in spite of improvements from 2004 in both sales and profit from the segments. This was primarily due to higher interest expense and re engineering and impairment charges, along with lower land sales. The Company had a negative provision for income taxes due to a settlement related to pre June 1996 taxes as well as various audit settlements and planning transactions. 18 Table of Contents Unallocated Expenses: The Company allocates corporate operating expenses to its reporting segments based upon estimated time spent related to those segments where a direct relationship is present and based upon segment revenue for general expenses. The unallocated expenses reflect amounts unrelated to segment operations. Allocations are determined at the beginning of the year based upon estimated expenditures. The unallocated expenses increased during 2006 as compared with 2005 primarily due to equity compensation, net losses from foreign exchange and higher public relations costs in an effort to contemporize the Companys brand perception. During 2006, the Company continued its program to sell land for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters which began in 2002. Pretax gains totaling $9.3 million ($5.5 million after tax) were recognized as a result of transactions completed during 2006. This amount compared with pretax gains of $4.0 million ($2.4 million after tax) during 2005 and $11.6 million ($7.1 million after tax) during 2004. Gains on land transactions are recorded based upon when the transactions close and proceeds are collected. Transactions in one period may not be representative of what may occur in other periods. Additionally in 2006, the Company recorded a pretax loss of $1.2 million as a result of a fire at its former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. The amount recorded is based on its current best estimate. As more information becomes available related to this event, adjustments may be necessary. The Company also recognized in 2004 a $1.5 million gain for the preliminary settlement of an insurance claim related to hurricane damage incurred at the Companys headquarters, and in 2006 a $4.4 million gain related to the final settlement of this claim. Included in 2006 net income were pretax charges of $7.6 million for re engineering and impairment compared with $16.7 million in 2005 ($5.7 million and $11.2 million after tax, respectively). These charges are discussed in the re engineering costs section following. International operations accounted for 84, 76 and 75 percent of the Companys sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. They also accounted for 90 and 97 percent of the Companys net segment profit in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and all of the Companys net segment profit in 2004. The increase in the percent of sales from international operations in 2006 was due to the inclusion of the Acquired Units results of operations for a full year. Gross Margin: Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 64.7 percent in 2006 compared with 64.3 percent in 2005, which was down from 65.3 percent in 2004. The slightly higher gross margin percentage in 2006 was due to the inclusion of a full year of the Acquired Units results, which run a slightly higher margin rate than the other units, as well as improvement in North America from the utilization of previously written down product, lower sales under incentive offers and LIFO reserve liquidation. These were partially offset by a lower margin percentage in Europe due to lower utilization of production capacity and a higher proportion of sales under incentive offers with a lower margin percentage for such items in Germany. On an overall basis in 2005, the decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs, particularly resin, and a higher proportion of promotional sales in Europe reflecting efforts to stimulate sales force recruiting, customer demand and party attendance. Costs and Expenses: Delivery, sales and administrative expense (DS&A) as a percentage of sales was 56.3, 54.6, and 56.3 percent, in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In 2006, the increase in DS&A as a percent of sales was due to the inclusion of a full year of the Acquired Units results, which run a slightly higher rate than the other units and $23.7 million of amortization of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting for the Acquired Units sales force relationships compared to $1.7 million in 2005. Excluding the amortization of intangible assets, DS&A as a percentage of sales was 54.9 and 54.5 percent in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2005, the decline in DS&A as a percent of sales was due to a continued focus on operating expense reductions throughout the Company, particularly in Tupperware United States and Canada despite the lower sales volume. 19 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company includes costs related to the distribution of its products in DS&A expense. As a result, the Companys gross margin may not be comparable with other companies that include these costs in cost of products sold. Re engineering Costs. As the Company continuously evaluates its operating structure in light of current business conditions and strives to maintain the most efficient possible cost structure, it periodically implements actions designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. These actions may result in re engineering costs related to facility downsizing and closure as well as related asset write downs and other costs that may be necessary in light of the revised operating landscape. In addition, the Company may recognize gains upon disposal of closed facilities or other activities directly related to its re engineering efforts. Over the past three years, the Company has incurred such costs (gains) as detailed below that were included in the following income statement captions (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Re engineering and impairment charges $ 7.6 $16.7 $ 7.0 Cost of products sold (2.4) Total pretax re engineering costs $ 7.6 $14.3 $ 7.0 Total after tax re engineering costs $ 5.8 $9.6 $ 4.3 In 2006, re engineering and impairment charges of $7.6 million included $7.5 million primarily related to severance costs incurred to reduce headcount in the Companys Canada, Belgium, Philippines, Australian mold making and Europe operations. The remaining $0.1 million was to write down the value of certain assets of the Companys Philippines facility. In 2005, re engineering and impairment charges of $16.7 million included $10.2 million primarily related to severance costs incurred to reduce headcount in the Companys South Carolina, Orlando, Australian mold making, Belgium, France and Portugal operations. In December 2004, the Company reached a decision to restructure its manufacturing facility in Hemingway, South Carolina. In 2005, the Company implemented its plans related to the Hemingway facility which resulted in the elimination of 269 positions and pretax severance and outplacement costs of approximately $7.2 million. An additional $0.9 million of severance was recorded for the elimination of 43 positions in the Companys U.S. sales operation. The balance of the $16.7 million charge was largely related to impairment charges recorded to write down the value of certain of the Companys United States warehousing and distribution capacity and related equipment, as well as a former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. In addition to headcount reductions, $3.2 million of pretax costs were incurred to relocate equipment to other facilities. As a result of the capacity shift, the Company also realized a $5.6 million reduction of its reserve for United States produced inventory that is accounted for under the last in first out (LIFO) method as that inventory was sold. Both of these items were recorded in cost of products sold. In 2004, the re engineering and impairment charges included severance costs of approximately $3.3 million primarily related to headcount reductions in the United States, Japan and the Philippines. The Philippines action also resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million. Also included in 2004 charges was a $3.2 million write off of currency translation adjustments related to the Companys decision to liquidate a foreign subsidiary during the year which was previously classified in other comprehensive income. The decision in December of 2004 to restructure the manufacturing facility in Hemingway, South Carolina in early 2005 resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Partially offsetting these charges was the reversal of approximately $0.8 million of prior accruals primarily due to lower than estimated severance costs in Europe as all activities were concluded. For further details of the re engineering actions, refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Tax Rate. The effective tax rates for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were 9.2, (31.2), and 14.8 percent, respectively. In 2006, the tax rate was impacted by tax planning and tax law changes in 2006, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the Acquired Units operations which currently carry a higher effective tax rate than the remainder of the Companys operations. 20 Table of Contents In 2005, the Company reached a settlement with its former parent company resulting in a cash receipt of $46 million including interest related to pre June 1996 tax liabilities. This generated a net tax benefit of approximately $25 million after considering amounts previously recorded as a receivable on the Companys balance sheet and a provision for taxes related to the interest portion of the settlement. This transaction, together with various audit settlements and year end tax planning transactions, resulted in the negative provision for income taxes for 2005. The 2004 rate reflected the impact of re engineering actions and gains on property dispositions, including the hurricane related insurance gain discussed earlier, as well as the net favorable resolution of domestic and international tax audit contingencies. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them and where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits would ultimately be realized and as such, no valuation allowance was necessary. This assessment was based upon expectations of improving domestic operating results as well as anticipated gains related to the Companys sales of land held for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters. In addition, certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits. Refer to the critical accounting policies section and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions of the Companys methodology for evaluating deferred tax assets. Based on expected revenue and profit contributions of the Companys various operations, management expects a tax rate in the low 20 percent range for 2007. Net Interest Expense. The Company incurred $47.0 million of net interest expense in 2006 compared with $45.1 million in 2005 and $13.0 million in 2004. Increased interest expense in 2006 was driven largely by the higher level of borrowing that resulted from financing the Acquisition in late 2005. The Companys primary borrowing in 2006 was through term loans due in 2012 under its credit facility. The principal balance on these term loans at the beginning of 2006 was $745.0 million, but was reduced by principal payments to $669.2 million as of the end of 2006. The interest rate charged on these loans is a floating LIBOR based rate and resulted in interest expense of $47.7 million in 2006, net of the impact from floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements on $375 million of the outstanding term loans. Additional interest expense on borrowings under the Companys $200.0 million committed revolving line of credit totaled $4.6 million. The Company maintained a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts that reduced interest expense by approximately two million dollars in 2006. Other interest expense resulted from bank borrowings at the Companys subsidiaries around the world and a loan secured by the BeautiControl headquarters in Dallas. Interest income during 2006 was approximately $8 million, including $3.6 million earned from an escrow account funded in December 2005 at the time of the Acquisition. In order to discharge the Companys $100.0 million 7.25 percent Notes due in October 2006, the Company funded an escrow account with cash in December 2005. Since the Notes were paid off from the escrowed funds in October 2006, the escrow account has been closed, and no interest income was earned thereon after October 1, 2006. The sharp increase in 2005 was due to slightly higher interest rates in 2005, along with the requirement to pay a make whole payment of $21.9 million for the early retirement of the Companys $150 million notes in connection with entering into new financing arrangements for the Acquisition and $6.0 million for the discharge of obligations related to $100 million of notes due in 2006. Issuance costs of approximately $0.8 million related to retired debt were also written off as part of interest expense. A credit of $3.2 million to recognize net deferred gains on interest rate swaps related to these debt agreements that were previously closed offset some of this expense. Interest expense also included a $3.1 million payment to close an interest rate hedge the Company previously entered into to lock in the base interest rate on the previously expected refinancing of its 2006 notes. As the Company progressed toward closing the Acquisition it became no longer probable in the third quarter of 2005 that the debt would be refinanced, and this agreement was no longer an effective hedge. See additional discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 21 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2007, the Company will begin hedging $50 million worth of its yen net equity and $300 million of its euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts. This will significantly reduce interest expense in the future with an approximate $5.0 million impact in 2007. The initial forward contracts will mature in 2007 and 2008 and will be settled in cash such that the Company will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar. Over time, this exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in the yen and the euro. Segment Results 2006 vs. 2005 As a result of changes in the Companys management structure as well as a re evaluation of the Companys operating segment definitions, the Company reorganized its previously reported segments as follows: There have been no changes to the Companys BeautiControl North America segment. International BeautiControl operations are reported in the segments in which the business component geographically resides. The International Beauty reportable segment includes the Acquired Units other than those operated in Southern Africa and Japan, as well as the Companys Tupperware operations in Central and South America and the Philippines which were included in the Companys Latin America and Asia Pacific reportable segments prior to 2006, respectively. The Companys Tupperware and BeautiControl operations in Mexico are included in the North America segment; they were included in the Latin America reportable segment prior to 2006. With the movement of Central and South America as well as Mexico, the Company no longer has a Latin America reportable segment. The Companys NaturCare&reg; brand business operating in Japan is included in the Asia Pacific segment; it was previously included in the International Beauty reporting segment. This change included the transfer of intangible assets and goodwill of $30.2 million and $24.3 million, respectively. The Companys Avroy Shlain&reg; and Swissgarde&reg; brand businesses operating in Southern Africa are now included in the Europe segment; they were previously included in the International Beauty reportable segment. This change included the transfer of intangible assets and goodwill of $16.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Prior period data has been reclassified to reflect these changes.

Excluding these units, local currency sales were three percent lower largely due to a 14 percent sales decline in Germany, the segments largest market, driven by a reduction in total and active sales force. In 2006 and 2005 the German market accounted for $198.0 million and $231.0 million of the segments sales, respectively. Additionally, in the Europe segment approximately $8 million less business to business sales than last year contributed to the sales decline. While the Company actively pursues business to business opportunities, sales from this channel are based on reaching agreements with business partners and their product needs, along with consideration of how the arrangements will be integrated with the party plan channel. Consequently, activity in one period may not be indicative of future trends. Other markets that were down versus 23 Table of Contents 2005 were the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland all due to a decrease in average active sales force, and in the case of Switzerland a large business to business transaction that did not recur. These declines were partially offset by Tupperware Southern Africa which had a significant increase in sales versus 2005 driven by good recruiting and increases in total and average active sales force. The emerging markets of Russia, Turkey and Poland had strong increases in 2006 with growth of 46 percent versus last year, while their contribution to total sales for the segment grew from 8 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2006. The largest sales growth contribution came from Russia, which was up 60 percent and contributed the largest dollar increase from last year of all markets in the segment. The segment overall ended the year with an eight percent sales force size advantage, but had a decline of eight percent in average active sales force in 2006 versus 2005. Although local currency sales increased slightly, profit was down 17 percent as reported and in local currency resulting in a decline of 3.6 percentage points in return on sales. The lower return on sales was driven by the decline in German sales which, despite the downturn, continue to carry a return above the segment average, and the mix of markets generating the profit, with a slight impact driven by the inclusion of a full year of results for the South African beauty units which operate at a lower return on sales. The higher operating costs were driven by increased costs in the growth markets and higher promotional expenses in an effort to increase the size of the total and active sales forces. Asia Pacific Net sales for the year increased both as reported and in local currency. Excluding NaturCare, the acquired Japan beauty unit that only had sales in one month in 2005, sales were up eight percent in local currency. Sales were up in virtually all markets, led by the emerging markets of China, India and Indonesia, which in total were up 28 percent, with the largest increase coming from China up 44 percent. In China, direct selling has been limited by law, and the Company reaches consumers through independent store fronts where the number of storefronts grew 25 percent to over 2,300. Japan, Korea and Australia had modest growth in local currency versus 2005 driven by a more productive sales force offset by less business to business sales in Korea. The decline in Koreas business to business sales is likely to continue. Excluding NaturCare, segment profit increased in both reported and local currency reflecting improvement in most markets and led by the emerging markets. Though costs showed a dollar increase versus 2005, as a percent of sales they were down driven primarily by strong sales growth, resulting in a 4.2 percentage point increase in return on sales. North America The slight increase in North American sales was primarily due to growth by Tupperware Mexico offset by a slight decrease in the United States. Mexico sales were up slightly in local currency driven by a slightly larger sales force, an increase in business to business sales and five percent growth in the sale of BeautiControl products. Canada sales were up modestly due to better productivity by the sales force partially due to the implementation of a new compensation plan which mirrors the plan implemented in the U.S. last year. In the United States, sales were down slightly versus last year although they were up in each of the third and fourth quarters versus the prior year. Though total and active sales forces were down for the year, productivity was up driven by the new multi tier sales force compensation system implemented in 2005. This new compensation system provides for override commissions on group sales with an emphasis on the earnings opportunity and recruiting new sellers into the business. This along with increased Company sponsored training and an experience based party format are designed to continue to improve future results. The Company is seeking to improve its U.S. business through a refreshed, interactive party format, continuing to introduce innovative and fashion forward products, public relations activities to ensure a broad understanding of the Companys current product categories, innovations and fashionability and a better balance between its emphasis on products and its sales force earnings opportunity. 24 Table of Contents North Americas profit came from Tupperware Mexico where profit was up 12 percent primarily reflecting sales growth but also a slight improvement in promotion and distribution expenses. There was a decrease in the U.S. loss of over 90 percent. The lower loss was driven by a higher gross margin percentage and a reduction in DS&A expenses. The improvement in gross margin was due to the utilization of previously written down product, fewer sales incentive offers and a reduction in the LIFO reserve. The improvement in expenses was primarily due to a reduction in distribution costs driven by improved freight pricing and a greater number of consolidated shipments. Additionally, in the United States, post retirement benefit costs were $1.2 million favorable to last year and are expected to decline another $1.0 to $1.5 million in 2007 (see Note 12 Retirement Benefit Plans for further details). BeautiControl North America BeautiControl North America had a slight increase in sales and profit. The business started the year slow but was up 6 percent in the second half of the year. The improvement in sales, particularly in the second half of the year, was due to increased volume reflecting a year over year total and active sales force size advantage. Recruiting remained strong again this year with a Spring campaign that was the second largest in BeautiControls history. The sales force growth continued to be fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy, replicable interactive party experience, the Spa ESCAPE. The sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with a slight improvement in gross margin driven by a better mix of sales. These were partially offset by higher operating expenses due to strong recruiting and transition costs incurred for a new manufacturing facility. The transition should be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2007. International Beauty The Acquired Units sales and profit were included in the Companys results beginning on December 5, 2005 with the closing of the Acquisition. The sales increase in the International Beauty segment reflected $442 million of sales by the Acquired Units in the segment. The largest market in the segment, Fuller Mexico, accounts for more than 60 percent of sales and an even greater proportion of segment profit. This business achieved significant sales growth from a larger and more productive sales force versus 2005, which was partially offset primarily by lower sales in the Philippines due a smaller sales force. The prior year results reflect $72.0 million of sales by the Acquired Units and the operations of Tupperware businesses in Central and South America and the Philippines. Combined, these businesses did not materially impact the comparison. Segment profit reflected the same factors as sales, along with approximately $18.1 million of negative impact from amortization expense primarily associated with intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting for the Acquired Units sales force relationships. Good progress was made during the year transitioning the Acquired Units into Tupperware Brands. The Nutrimetics Australia business is similar to BeautiControl North America in terms of its skin care focused product line, party plan orientation and sales force compensation model. Its party format and compensation model have been adjusted to be more similar to what has worked well for BeautiControl North America and are expected to reenergize that business. In Central and South America, progress has been made in combining back office functions in Brazil and in some cases both beauty and Tupperware&reg; products are being sold by the same sales force. 25 Table of Contents Segment Results 2005 vs. 2004 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Change (a) Changeexcludingthe impactof foreignexchange Foreignexchangeimpact Percent of total Dollar Percent 2005 2004 Sales Europe $ 602.5 $ 597.0 $ 5.5 1% % $ 6.2 47% 49% Asia Pacific 204.5 194.8 9.7 5 5 0.6 16 16 North America 253.6 278.7 (25.1 ) (9) (11) 5.2 20 23 BeautiControl N.A. 146.7 118.0 28.7 24 24 0.2 11 10 International Beauty 72.0 35.7 36.3 + 88 2.6 6 3 Total net sales $ 1,279.3 $ 1,224.3 $ 55.1 5 3 $ 14.8 100 100 Segment profit (loss) Europe (c), (d) $ 116.2 $ 133.4 $ (17.2 ) (13)% (13)% $ 0.7 77% 82% Asia Pacific (c), (e) 20.2 20.5 (0.3 ) (1) (5) 0.8 13 13 North America (c) 0.5 (22.3 ) 22.8 nm nm 0.2 na BeautiControl N.A. 14.0 8.0 6.0 75.0 74 9 5 International Beauty (b), (f) 0.9 1.6 (0.7 ) (44) (55) (0.4 ) 1 1 Segment profit as a percentage of sales Europe 19 % 22 % na (3.1)pp (2.9)pp (0.2 )pp na na Asia Pacific 10 11 na (0.6) (1.0) 0.4 na na North America nm na 8.2 8.0 0.2 na na BeautiControl N.A. 10 7 na 2.8 2.7 na na International Beauty 1 4 na (3.2) (4.0) 0.8 na na a. 2005 actual compared with 2004 translated at 2005 exchange rates. b.

The emerging markets of Russia, Turkey and Poland had strong increases in 2005 with growth of 41 percent from last year. The largest sales growth contribution came from Russia, which was up over 50 percent and contributed the largest dollar increase from last year of all markets in 26 Table of Contents the segment. South Africa and France also contributed nicely to sales growth from 2004 due to larger total and active sales forces. These positive results were partially offset by large sales declines in the Nordics, Netherlands, Austria and Germany. The segments largest market, Germany, was down eight percent from last year. While it ended the year with a larger sales force size, for most of the year it operated at a sales force size disadvantage. Additionally, a sales force size advantage for most of the fourth quarter did not offset lower sales force productivity due to a difficult consumer environment. Sales in 2005 in Germany totaled $231.0 million, as compared with $251.1 million in 2004. The segment overall ended the year with a 13 percent sales force size advantage and achieved a 6 percent average active sales force size advantage in the fourth quarter of 2005 versus 2004. Overall, the segments sales decline absent the business to business impact noted above was due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a slight increase in overall pricing. The average pricing increase was negatively impacted by the mix of products sold. There was also a negative impact from the mix of markets generating sales. Although local currency sales increased slightly, profit was down 13 percent as reported and 12 percent in local currency primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses. The lower gross margin was a result of higher resin costs, which were not totally offset by price increases, and a less favorable sales mix. The increased operating expenses were primarily for higher promotional expenses in Germany to increase the size of the sales force. Asia Pacific Net sales for the year increased slightly both as reported and in local currency. This comparison benefited from the inclusion in 2004 of a product recall in Japan that resulted in sales returns of $5.5 million, at the 2005 foreign exchange rate. Excluding this benefit, local currency sales would have been flat. Significant sales increases in China and Korea combined with a strong increase in Australia were partially offset by a significant sales decline in Japan. China sales grew over 70 percent and contributed the largest dollar increase in the Asia Pacific segment during 2005 with almost 2,000 storefronts operating at the end of 2005, which was up over 50 percent from 2004. Storefront sales productivity was up as well. Korea benefited from higher business to business transactions and core sales during the year, while Australia grew sales through a higher active and more productive sales force. Asia Pacific had a small decline in overall sales volume for the year, but was able to offset that with a more favorable mix of products sold as well as lower overall sales discounting. In spite of a slight sales increase, both reported and local currency profit was flat reflecting results in Japan. The product recall in Japan mentioned earlier had no impact on the profitability comparison as the vendor reimbursed the Company for lost profit and costs related to the recall. North America North America had a decline in sales in 2005 due to lower volume that was only partially offset by an improved product mix that included fewer sales force support items. This was due almost exclusively to the performance in the United States, which continued to struggle and had a 28 percent decline in the number of average active sellers in 2005 versus 2004. In April 2005, the Company completed its implementation of a multi tier compensation system for its sales force. The new system is more competitive in the U.S. market than the previous format and emphasizes building ones business through recruiting. The Company started training its independent sales force in 2004 to operate successfully under this new model. 27 Table of Contents Mexico had a slight increase in sales for the year driven by an increase in the total and active sales force count along with continued growth in the sale of BeautiControl products. Beauty sales grew 20 percent compared with 2004 and accounted for 10 percent of Mexican sales. Mexico profit improved slightly due to sales growth however, profit growth was less due to strategic investments made to expand BeautiControls sales contribution. The segment was about break even in spite of the substantial sales decline in the United States results. This improvement was largely due to the significant improvements in the United States driven by value chain improvements implemented during 2004 and 2005 including a restructure of its manufacturing operations in Hemingway, South Carolina to source the majority of its products from the Companys other manufacturing facilities. The Company also realized a benefit of $7.2 million from reduced LIFO reserve needs as United States produced inventory was sold including $5.6 million directly related to the capacity shift. Additionally, the United States benefited from an approximate four million dollars reallocation of corporate overhead charges. BeautiControl North America BeautiControl North America had substantial increases in both sales and segment profit in 2005 which were largely volume related. A higher proportion of sales of low priced items to support increased recruiting resulted in a slightly lower average selling price. The improved performance was a result of substantial increases in both the total and active sales forces during the year with the business closing 2005 with a 20 percent advantage in the total sales force. The sales force growth was fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy, replicable interactive party experience, the Spa ESCAPE. The sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with the absence of an approximate $2.5 million charge in the first quarter of 2004 related to an accrual for legal matters and an executive retirement. International Beauty The Acquired Units sales and profit were included in the Companys results beginning on December 5, 2005 with the closing of the acquisition of Sara Lee Corporations direct selling businesses. The sales and profit were $37.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively, including $1.3 million of purchase accounting amortization. Sales and profit were strong in Fuller Mexico, partially offset by some weakness in Australia and Fuller Philippines. After considering incremental interest expense related to the acquisition, the Acquired Units had little net impact on 2005 earnings. The balance of this segment consisted of Tupperware Central and South America and the Philippines. Combined, these operations did not have a significant impact on segment results as the negative impact of a large decline in the Philippines average active sales force was balanced by improvement in Central and South America. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources. Working capital increased, reaching $220.5 million as of December 30, 2006 compared with $218.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and $173.9 million as of December 25, 2004. The current ratio was 1.6 to 1 at the end of 2006 compared with 1.5 to 1 at the end of 2005 and 1.6 to 1 at the end of 2004. The 2006 working capital increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations and an increase in accounts receivable driven by strong year end sales in Mexico. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. The 2005 working capital increase, exclusive of the impact from the Acquired Units, was due to an increase in cash primarily from cash generated from operations, including the settlement of pre June 1996 income taxes with the Companys former parent, along with proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the pay down of debt. Another impact was a decrease in accounts payable in the existing businesses 28 Table of Contents primarily due to the timing of year end. The December 31 year end for 2005 resulted in more of the Companys trade payables coming due before the end of the year. Of the Companys year end cash balance of $181.5 million, $105 million was paid out in 2006 in connection with the Acquisition. This included approximately $80 million of taxes that had been withheld for the benefit of a subsidiary of Sara Lee Corporation related to its sale of the Mexican operations and other income tax items related to the Acquisition. The $44.1 million overall working capital increase in relation to the Acquisition is summarized as follows: (In millions) 2005 vs. 2004 Acquired Units $94.1 Tax accruals related to the Acquisition (93.7) Pre acquisition existing business 43.7 Total working capital increase $44.1 In conjunction with closing the Acquisition on December 5, 2005, the Company entered into a new credit agreement that included a seven year $775 million term loan bearing an annual interest rate of 150 basis points over the LIBOR rate and a $200 million revolving credit facility. This agreement replaced the Companys previously existing $200 million revolving line of credit. The Company used cash on hand and the term loan borrowings to fund the amount due to Sara Lee Corporation, to discharge its then outstanding $100 million notes due in 2006 and to repay its $150 million notes due in 2011. The settlement of the 2011 notes required make whole payments to the note holders of approximately $22 million. In anticipation of this transaction, the Company closed fixed to variable interest rate swaps with combined notional amounts totaling $150 million that were scheduled to expire in 2011 with the notes. These swaps were entered to convert the Companys $150 million notes from fixed to variable interest rates. Closing these swaps resulted in a loss of approximately $3.1 million that was recorded as a component of income when the notes were settled. As also discussed in the market risk section, the Company exited an agreement to lock in a fixed 10 year treasury rate that was to provide the base interest for an anticipated refinancing of its $100 million 2006 notes. The $3.1 million cost to exit this arrangement was recorded as a component of interest expense in the third quarter of 2005. In addition to the amounts discussed above, upon closure of the transaction, the Company expensed unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the settled debt totaling approximately $0.8 million and recognized deferred net gains related to previously terminated hedging arrangements associated with the settled debt. These net gains were $3.2 million. Unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $0.6 million related to the Companys existing revolving credit agreement were added to the costs related to the new revolver and are being amortized over its 5 year term. Borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys domestic assets and 65 percent of its stock in its significant foreign subsidiaries. Principal payments on the term loan are 1 percent of the original amount per year in years 1 to 6 and the first 3 quarters of year 7 in quarterly installments. The balance will be due in a balloon payment at the end of the seven year term. The agreement also requires additional principal payments consisting of 100 percent of cash generated from certain asset sales and new debt issuances as well as up to 50 percent of excess cash flows. Excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, required debt payments and dividends paid up to $60 million annually. While the covenants are restrictive and could inhibit the Companys ability to pay dividends or buy back stock, the Company currently believes it will be able to continue paying its current $0.22 per share quarterly dividend under the covenant requirements. See further information in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The $775.0 million Term Loan was reduced to $745.0 million at the end of 2005, and principal payments made during 2006 further reduced the balance to $669.2 million as of December 30, 2006. Due to prepayments made in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company had no scheduled payments in 2006. However, the Company made voluntary payments of $63.0 million and mandatory payments of $12.8 million. The mandatory payments were a result of the sale of land in the Orlando, Florida area. The Companys two debt rating agencies, Standard and Poors and Moodys, have both rated the Company. Standard and Poors currently rates the corporate credit rating of the Company BB and assigns a stable outlook. Moodys assigns a rating of Ba2 to the corporate family rating of the Company. 29 Table of Contents As of December 30, 2006, the Company had $186.2 million available under its revolving line of credit and $121.0 million available under other uncommitted lines of credit, along with a cash balance of $102.2 million. Current and committed borrowing facilities and cash generated by operating activities are expected to be adequate to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures. The Companys major markets for its products are Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the United States. A significant downturn in the Companys business in these markets would adversely impact the Companys ability to generate operating cash flows. The previously discussed downturn in the Companys German business has impacted its ability to contribute the same historical level of operating cash flows to the Company and the operating losses in the Tupperware United States business has impacted its ability to contribute operating cash flows. However, neither of these situations has resulted in a material negative impact to the Company as a whole. Operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment, retention and activity of the Companys independent sales force, the success of new products and promotional programs. Included in the cash balance of $102.2 million reported at the end of 2006 was $10.3 million denominated in Venezuela bolivars. The balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market. Due to Venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company can not immediately repatriate this cash at the exchange rate used to translate the Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars for inclusion on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. It will apply for, and expects to receive, authorization in 2007 to transfer approximately half of such amount out of the country. It has also implemented other strategies in an effort to eventually repatriate the entire cash balance. The Company believes it could immediately repatriate the cash from Venezuela, but it would only be able to do so at a significantly less favorable exchange rate. This would result in the Company having fewer U.S. dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated income statement. The debt to total capital ratio at the end of 2006 was 63 percent compared with 69 percent at the end of 2005. Debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity. The decrease in debt from the same period a year ago reflected the debt principal payments made from cash generated from operations and from the sale of real estate in the Orlando, Florida area. The increase in equity resulted largely from earnings in 2006, reduced by dividends paid during the year. Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 was $172.8 compared with $139.9 million in 2005 and $121.4 million in 2004. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2006 versus 2005 reflected higher cash pretax income, excluding land sales, of close to $70 million, along with a cash inflow from higher payables and accruals this year as opposed to an outflow last year. The improvement in payables and accruals was largely due to the management of the timing of payments and the volume of business in certain markets. There were also smaller improvements in inventory from the sale of slow moving items in certain markets and in non trade receivables reflecting lower VAT receivables and amounts relating to hedging transactions. The main offsets were from cash tax payments of $30 million this year versus net receipts of $35 million in 2005 that included a $46 million receipt from the Companys former parent. There was also an outflow from trade receivables in 2006, versus an inflow in 2005, reflecting higher December sales in certain markets, as well as higher past due amounts. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the $46 million received in connection with settling pre June 1996 income taxes with the Companys former parent. The Company also received a refund of approximately $10 million from the United States Internal Revenue Service in settlement of audits for the period 1996 to 2001. These items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. There was a cash inflow from settling hedge contracts this year versus an outflow last year due to a weaker U.S. dollar during 2005 than in 2004. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company spent $52.1 million, $52.0 million and $43.6 million respectively, for capital expenditures. The most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products with the greatest amount spent in Europe. The slight increase from last year was primarily due to higher spending on improvements made for capacity expansion at BeautiControl North America. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Partially offsetting the capital spending was $25.5 million in 2006, $8.0 million in 2005 and $16.6 million in 2004, of proceeds related to the sale of certain property, plant and equipment in addition to insurance proceeds received in 2006 and 2004 for property damaged by a hurricane in 2004. The proceeds from the sales were primarily related to land for development near the Companys Orlando, Florida headquarters. Cumulative proceeds from the Companys program to sell land for development which began in 2002, are now expected to be up to $125 million by the end of 2009, including $58 million received through the end of 2006, inclusive of the sale of the Companys former convention center facility. Additionally, 2006 and 2005 included net cash outflows of $104.9 million and $464.3 million, respectively, in connection with the Acquisition. See discussion above in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Financing Activities. The primary financing activities were the net proceeds from issuance of term debt of $762.5 million to fund the Acquisition and refinance existing debt in 2005 as well as net repayments of $77 million primarily related to the term loan. See detailed discussion in Liquidity and Capital resources including settlement of historical debt and related covenant restrictions. Dividends. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company paid dividends of $0.88 per share of common stock totaling $53.3 million, $52.4 million and $51.6 million, respectively. At the time of its emergence as a publicly held corporation with its spin off from Premark International, Inc. in May 1996, the Company established a target of paying 35 percent of trailing four quarter income as a dividend. At that time, such a policy equated to a dividend level of approximately $0.88 per share annually. Despite decreases in income, the Company has generated sufficient cash flows from operations, dispositions of property and available borrowing capacity to fund its historical requirement for cash over the period since the spin off, including working capital and capital spending needs, its share repurchase program concluded in 1998, its acquisition of BeautiControl in 2000, the Sara Lee direct selling businesses in 2005, debt service and its dividend. As noted above, a majority of the Acquisition was funded through new borrowings. While the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis, in the absence of a significant event requiring cash, the Company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operations as well as additional property sales are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the Companys ability to finance its operations, make necessary investments in the future growth of the business or its near term debt repayment obligations. If there is an event requiring the use of cash, such as a strategic acquisition, the Company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout. Stock Option Exercises. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company received proceeds of $7.4 million, $30.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively, related to the exercise of outstanding stock options. The corresponding shares were issued out of the Companys balance held in treasury. Subscriptions Receivable. In October 2000, a subsidiary of the Company adopted a Management Stock Purchase Plan (the MSPP), which provided for eligible executives to purchase Company stock using full recourse loans provided by the subsidiary. Under the MSPP, the Company loaned $13.6 million to 33 senior executives to purchase 847,000 common shares from treasury stock. In 2001 and 2002, an additional nine senior executives purchased 74,500 shares of common stock from treasury stock utilizing loans totaling $1.7 million. The loans have annual interest rates of 5.21 percent to 5.96 percent, and all dividends, while the loans are outstanding, are applied toward interest due. Each of the loans has scheduled repayment dates of 25 percent on the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the loan issuance, with the balance due on the eighth anniversary. There were no new participants during 2006, 2005, or 2004. During each of 2005 and 2004, two participants left the Company and surrendered 38,802 and 37,000 shares, respectively, to the Company, at the current market price, to satisfy loans 31 Table of Contents totaling $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The MSPP permits the surrender of shares in lieu of payment of the loan with the surrendered shares valued at the then current market price. During 2006, thirteen participants surrendered a total of 99,388 shares of the Companys common stock to the Company at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling $2.1 million as part of both scheduled and voluntary repayments. In addition, participants made cash payments to satisfy loan and interest payment obligations totaling $0.5 million. During 2005, 22 executives surrendered 254,441 shares to satisfy $5.6 million of loans and four participants made cash payments to satisfy loan payment obligations totaling $0.6 million. An additional participant left the Company during 2004 and made a cash payment of $0.7 million to satisfy the loan obligation. Also during 2004, a participant elected to make a voluntary advance loan payment totaling $0.6 million. Based upon the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, no further loans under this plan will be permitted. Based upon the loan payment schedule, the Company expects to receive $1.3 million of payments during 2007. On November 30, 1998, the Company made a non recourse, non interest bearing loan of $7.7 million (the loan) to its chairman and chief executive officer (chairman), the proceeds of which were used by the chairman to buy in the open market 400,000 shares of the Companys common stock (the shares) at an average price of $19.12 per share. The shares were pledged to secure the repayment of the loan. The loan was recorded as a subscription receivable and was due November 12, 2006, with voluntary prepayments permitted commencing November 12, 2002, and mandatory repayments equal to 10 percent of annual bonus payments. On October 26, 2006 the Companys chairman and chief executive officer surrendered 330,368 shares of the Companys common stock at the current market price of $21.49 in satisfaction of the $7.1 million outstanding balance, which had previously been reduced through cash payments of $0.6 million. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at December 30, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions).

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 32 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers. This evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer. It is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects, particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due. This evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience, market penetration levels, access to alternative channels and similar factors. It also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts. Based upon the results of this analysis, for this risk the Company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts. This analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates, and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventory Valuation. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand. The demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs, new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels. The Company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products. If inventory quantity exceeds projected demand, the excess inventory is written down. However, if actual demand is less than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys tax planning strategies. These estimates are made based upon the Companys business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis; consequently, future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible. Any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs. At the end of 2006, the Company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately $186.5 million against which a valuation allowance of $2.4 million has been provided. Of this total, approximately $63.9 million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items. The balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon an increase in domestic income from BeautiControl North America as well as expected improvement in the Tupperware United States business. Also, expected gains related to the Companys previously discussed Orlando land sales activities will result in the realization of a portion of these assets. In addition, certain tax planning transactions are available to the Company should they be necessary. Promotional and Other Accruals. The Company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels, party attendance, recruiting or other business critical activities. The awards offered are in the form of cash, product awards, special prizes or trips. The cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award. These accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred. The Company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis. It considers the historical success of similar programs, current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched. During the promotion qualification period, actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known. Like the promotional accruals, other accruals are recorded at a time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur. 33 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill. The Companys recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of BeautiControl in October 2000 and the Acquired Units in December 2005. The Company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to the BeautiControl and the Acquired Units, respectively. Additionally, in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the Company to believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred, a test would be completed at that time. The valuation of its goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of its BeautiControl operations both in North America and internationally and the operations of the Acquired Units. The Company estimates the fair value of its BeautiControl and Acquired Units operations using discounted future cash flow estimates. Such a valuation requires the Company to make significant estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows including projections of revenue, costs, utilization of assets and capital requirements. It also requires estimates in allocating the goodwill to the different segments that include BeautiControl operations (BeautiControl North America, Asia Pacific and Mexico) and the Acquired Units operations (Europe, Asia Pacific and International Beauty). Lastly, it requires estimates as to the appropriate discounting rates to be used. The results of the reviews conducted to date related to BeautiControl and the Acquired Units indicate fair values in excess of the carrying values of the respective business operations. The most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation. If operating cash flows were to be more than 20 percent worse than projected, the Company would need to calculate a potential impairment as it relates to BeautiControl operations in Mexico and the Acquired Units operations at Nutrimetics&reg;, NaturCare&reg; and the South African beauty units. In BeautiControl and the remaining Acquired Units operations, a reduction of operating cash flows of more than 75 percent would be required to necessitate calculating a potential impairment. A significant impairment would have an adverse impact on the Companys net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the Companys debt covenants. Other Intangible Assets. The Company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and trade names of $197.4 million in conjunction with its purchase of the Acquired Units. These amounts have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment as discussed in goodwill valuation above. Additionally, the Company recorded $62 million for valuation of the Acquired Units sales forces, and $3.6 million for product formulations. The estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with the above intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is $12.7 million, $8.7 million, $5.4 million, $3.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Retirement Obligations. The Companys employee pension and other post employment benefits (health care) costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include health care cost trend rates, salary growth, long term return on plan assets, discount rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are based upon historical results, the near term outlook and an assessment of long term trends. The salary growth assumptions reflect the Companys historical experience and outlook. The long term return on plan assets are based upon historical results of the plan and investment market overall, as well as the Companys belief as to the future returns to be earned over the life of the plans. The discount rate is based upon current yields of AA rated corporate long term bond yields. The Companys key assumptions and funding expectations are indicated in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company amended its domestic retiree medical plan effective April 1, 2007. Prior to the effective date but after January 1, 1995, the Company subsidized the cost of health care for retirees based on age and years of service. For under age 65 retirees, the amendment altered the Companys contribution from a percent of cost to a fixed amount. For over age 65 retirees, the amendment lowered the fixed subsidy amount. For former associates retired prior to January 1, 1995 and under the age of 80, the amendment introduced a monthly premium charge of $35 per covered adult. The change resulted in a decrease of expense of $0.3 million in 2006 and is expected to decrease the annual cost by approximately $1.5 million in 2007 and thereafter. 34 Table of Contents Effective December 30, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No.158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans). Employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income. This Statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date. Prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158, the Company accounted for its defined benefit post retirement plans under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS No. 87 required that a liability (minimum pension liability) be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets. Any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. SFAS No. 106 required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employees service rendered to date. Under both SFAS No. 87 and No. 106, changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized, rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods. Upon adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158, the Company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For 2005, the Company increased its health care cost trend rate to 10 percent for all participants grading down to 5 percent in 2010. This change represented an increase of one percentage point for post 65 age participants and three percentage points for pre 65 age participants. As a result, 2005 pretax expense related to the Companys post employment health care plan increased approximately $0.5 million. Unrecognized losses on post employment plans as shown in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements are not expected to result in a material increase of pretax expense as compared with that of 2005. Effective June 30, 2005, the Company froze the accrual of benefits to participants under its domestic defined benefit pension plans. This action necessitated a re measurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax increase of $4.8 million ($3.1 million after tax). This change resulted in the elimination of the service cost component of net periodic pension expense as it relates to these plans and an ongoing annual reduction of approximately $2.5 million or about $1.2 million as compared with 2005. Due to an excess of lump sum retirement distributions from its domestic pension plans as compared with service and interest costs, the Company recorded a settlement charge of approximately $0.9 million in 2005. In conjunction with the benefit freeze, the Company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from 3 percent of eligible employee compensation up to the Social Security Wage Base to 5 percent. Impact of Inflation Inflation as measured by consumer price indices has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the Company operates. New Pronouncements Refer to discussion of new pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Market Risk One of the Companys market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes. The Company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings, interest rate swaps, the currencies in which it borrows and the interest rate lock described below. The Company has previously set a target, over time, of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements. As discussed earlier, the Companys post acquisition term debt carries a variable interest rate, but requires the Company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least 40 percent of total debt during the term of the loan. The Company entered into swap agreements in December 2005 and January 2006 to fix the rate on $375 million of its debt for at least three years from the date of the contracts at a rate of approximately 6.3 percent. If short term interest rates varied by 10 percent the Companys annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately $2.5 million. The Company had intended to refinance its $100 million notes when they came due in 2006. To protect itself from the risk of higher interest rates, in March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed 10 year treasury rate of approximately 4.70 percent that would provide the base interest for the debt to be issued in the refinancing. This derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly basis. In light of the refinancing necessary for the Acquisition, the agreement was terminated since it was no longer an effective hedge. This action resulted in a charge of $3.1 million in interest expense during the third quarter of 2005. During 2002, the Company entered an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 6.7 billion Japanese yen that matured on January 24, 2007. The Company paid a fixed rate payment of 0.63 percent semi annually and received a Japanese yen floating rate payment based on the LIBOR rate which is determined two days before each interest payment date. At inception the Company believed that this agreement would provide a valuable economic hedge against rising interest rates in Japan by converting the variable interest rate implicit in the Companys rolling net equity hedges in Japan to a fixed rate. The balance of net equity hedges in Japan was reduced with a large reduction occurring in the second quarter of 2005. The Company, however, maintained the interest rate swap agreement until maturity. This agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Accordingly, changes in the market value of the swap were recorded as a component of net interest expense as incurred. As of December 30, 2006, the cumulative loss was about $0.4 million, which was fully recognized in 2007. A significant portion of the Companys sales and profit comes from its international operations. Although these operations are geographically dispersed, which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries, the Company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations. These risks include local political and economic environments, and relations between foreign and U.S. governments. Another economic risk of the Company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of the Companys international operations. The Company is not able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings. This is due to the Companys constantly changing exposure to various currencies, the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the U.S. dollar and the large number of currencies involved, although the Companys most significant exposures are to the euro and Mexican peso. Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Companys local product sourcing in many markets, a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company uses financial instruments, such as forward contracts, to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations. In addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates, the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations. The Company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable, non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases. 36 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2007, the Company expects to enter into a series of new forward contracts that will significantly reduce interest expense in the future by selling forward and additional $50 million of Japanese yen and $300 million of euro. The forward contracts will deemed to be Net Equity Hedges under the guidelines provided by SFAS 133, and will effectively convert a larger portion of the Companys US dollar denominated debt into euro and Japanese yen. This action is expected to reduce interest expense during 2007 by approximately $5.0 million. It will increase the risk to the Companys cash flow, as the settlement at maturity of these new forward contracts will be impacted by changes in exchange rates but be mitigated somewhat by allowing the Company to settle debt effectively in currencies generating a greater proportion of its operating cash flows. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company will begin hedging $50 million worth of its yen net equity and $300 million of its euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts. This will significantly reduce interest expense in the future with an approximate $5.0 million impact in 2007. The initial forward contracts will mature in 2007 and 2008 and will be settled in cash such that the Company will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar. Over time, this exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in the yen and the euro. The Company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future. See further discussion regarding the Companys hedging activities for foreign currency in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins. This is the primary material used in production of Tupperware products, and totaled about $85 million in 2006. A 10 percent fluctuation in the cost of resin could therefore impact the Companys annual cost of sales in the eight to nine million dollar range as compared with the prior year. The Company manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements. It also manages its margin through the pricing of its products, with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation, and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers. It may also, on occasion, make advance material purchases to take advantage of what it perceives to be favorable pricing. At this point in time, the Company has determined that entering forward contracts for resin prices is not cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place. However, should circumstances warrant, the Company may consider such contracts in the future. The Companys program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process. Included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals, the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial developments in the Orlando real estate market and general economic conditions, such as interest rate increases.
