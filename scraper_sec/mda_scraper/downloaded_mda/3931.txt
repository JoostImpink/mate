(2) Revenue decreased starting in October 2003 due to the NIA Arbitration Settlement. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Companys financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10 K. Factors Affecting the Results of Operations Seasonality The Casecnan Project is dependent upon sufficient rainfall to generate electricity and deliver water. The seasonality of rainfall patterns and the variability of rainfall from year to year, all of which are outside the control of the Company, have a material impact on the amounts of electricity generated and water delivered by the Casecnan Project. Rainfall has historically been highest from June through December and lowest from January through May. The contractual terms for water delivery fees and variable energy fees (described below) can produce significant variability in revenue between reporting periods. 8 Under the Supplemental Agreement, the water delivery fee is payable in a fixed monthly payment based upon an average annual water delivery of 801.9 million cubic meters, pro rated to approximately 66.8 million cubic meters per month, multiplied by the applicable per cubic meter rate through December 25, 2008. For each contract year starting from December 25, 2003 and ending on December 25, 2008, a water delivery fee credit (deferred revenue) is computed equal to 801.9 million cubic meters minus the greater of actual water deliveries or 700.0 million cubic meters the minimum threshold. The water delivery fee credit at the end of each contract year is available to be earned in the succeeding contract year through December 25, 2008. The cumulative water delivery fee credit at December 25, 2008, if any, shall be amortized from December 25, 2008 through December 25, 2013. Accordingly, in recognizing revenue, the water delivery fees are recorded each month pro rated to approximately 58.3 million cubic meters per month until the minimum threshold has been reached for the current contract year. Subsequent water delivery fees within the contract year are based on actual water delivered. The Company earns guaranteed energy fees based upon an assumed delivery of 19.0 GWh per month, at a rate of $0.1596 per kWh. The Company earns variable energy fees based upon actual energy delivered in each month in excess of 19.0 GWh, payable at a rate of $0.1509 per kWh. Starting in 2009, the kWh rate for energy deliveries in excess of 19.0 GWh per month is reduced to $0.1132, escalating at 1% per annum thereafter. Any deliveries of energy in excess of 490.0 GWh, but less than 550.0 GWh per year are paid at a rate of 1.3 pesos per kWh, reduced to 0.98 pesos starting 2009 and escalated at 1% per annum thereafter. Deliveries in excess of 550.0 GWh per year are at no cost to NIA. Within each contract year, no variable energy fees are payable until energy in excess of the cumulative 19.0 GWh per month for the contract year to date has been delivered. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 The following table provides certain operating data of the Casecnan Project for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Electricity produced (GWh) 538.5 406.5 Water delivered (million cubic meters) 996.0 723.0 For accounting purposes, the Project Agreement with NIA contains both an operating lease and a service contract, which the Company accounted for pursuant to provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Pursuant to the provisions of the Project Agreement, the Company earned water and energy fees as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 Water delivery fees $ 57.3 $ 53.3 Guaranteed energy fees 36.4 36.4 Variable energy fees 41.0 24.9 Deferred water delivery fees 13.8 (7.6 ) Total lease rentals and service contracts revenue $ 148.5 $ 107.0 Revenue for 2006 increased by $41.5 million to $148.5 million compared with 2005. The increase in water delivery fees was primarily due to the contractual 7.5% annual escalation factor. The higher variable energy fees in 2006 were due to higher generation for the year of 538.5 GWh compared to 406.5 GWh in 2005. Accumulated deferred water delivery fees in prior years were fully earned in 2006 due to high water deliveries which exceeded the 801.9 million cubic meters threshold. The higher generation and water deliveries were the result of above average rainfall in most months of 2006. Interest expense for 2006 decreased $3.4 million to $21.4 million compared with 2005, due primarily to lower outstanding debt balances resulting from the scheduled repayment of debt. Interest income for 2006 increased $1.1 million to $3.0 million compared with 2005, due to higher average cash balances and higher average interest rates on investments. 9 Other, net for 2006 increased $3.7 million to $4.0 million compared with 2005, due primarily to value added tax recoveries exceeding obligations as a result of a change in the value added tax law which became effective on November 1, 2005. The provision for income tax for 2006 increased $1.2 million to $2.3 million as income not subject to the income tax holiday was higher than in 2005. The income tax holiday is scheduled to expire in December 2007 after which all CE Casecnan income will become subject to income tax at the statutory rate of 35%. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 The following table provides certain operating data of the Casecnan Project for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Electricity produced (GWh) 406.5 404.5 Water delivered (million cubic meters) 723.0 719.2 For accounting purposes, the Project Agreement with NIA contains both an operating lease and a service contract, which the Company accounted for pursuant to provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Pursuant to the provisions of the Project Agreement, the Company earned water and energy fees as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 Water delivery fees $ 53.3 $ 49.6 Guaranteed energy fees 36.4 36.4 Variable energy fees 24.9 26.9 Deferred water delivery fees (7.6 ) (6.1 ) Total lease rentals and service contracts revenue $ 107.0 $ 106.8 Revenue for 2005 increased by $0.2 illion to $107.0 illion compared with 2004. The increase in water delivery fees and deferred water delivery fees was primarily due to the contractual 7.5% annual escalation factor. Differences between calendar year operations and contract year invoicing resulted in lower variable energy fees in 2005 compared to 2004 despite marginally higher total energy production during the calendar year. The monthly billing cycle runs from the 25th day of a given calendar month to the 25th day of the following month. Within each billing cycle, the Casecnan Project must produce 19.0 GWh of electricity before it can earn variable energy fees. The electricity generated by heavy water flows in the last six days of the December 2005 (the start of the new billing cycle) did not generate any variable energy fees in calendar year 2005. Operating expenses for 2005 decreased by $2.1 illion to $31.3 illion compared with 2004. Road maintenance was $0.7 million lower in 2005 due to damage caused by typhoons in 2004. Engineering and consulting expenses were $0.7 million lower in 2005 due to plant optimization activities in 2004 and the construction contract arbitration settlement in April 2004. Depreciation expense decreased by $0.5 million in 2005 due to the lower depreciable base resulting from the construction contract arbitration settlement in April 2004. Interest expense for 2005 decreased $4.7 million to $24.8 million compared with 2004, due primarily to lower outstanding debt balances resulting from the scheduled repayment of debt. The provision for income tax for 2005 increased by $1.0 million to $1.1 million compared with 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.7 million on interest income earned outside the Philippines. Liquidity and Capital Resources CE Casecnan constructed and operates the Casecnan Project, which was developed as an unsolicited proposal under the Philippine build own operate transfer law, pursuant to the terms of the Project Agreement. CE Casecnan is registered with the Philippine Board of Investments as a new operator of hydroelectric power plant with pioneer status under the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 226). Under the terms of its registration, CE Casecnan is entitled to certain incentives which include an income tax holiday for six years from the start of commercial operations, tax and duty free importation of capital equipment, tax credits on domestic capital equipment, and exemption from customs duties and national internal revenue taxes for the importation and unrestricted use of the consigned equipment for the development, construction, start up, testing and operation of the power plant. CE Casecnan developed, financed and constructed the Casecnan Project over the construction period, and owns and operates the Casecnan Project for the term of the Cooperation Period, which commenced on December 11, 2001. During the Cooperation Period, NIA is obligated to accept all deliveries of water and energy, and so long as the Casecnan Project is physically capable of operating and delivering in accordance with agreed levels set forth in the Project Agreement, NIA is obligated to pay CE Casecnan a fixed fee for the delivery of a threshold volume of water and a fixed fee for the delivery of a threshold amount of electricity. In addition, NIA is obligated to pay a fee for all electricity delivered in excess of the threshold amount up to a specified amount and will be obligated to pay a fee for all water delivered in excess of the threshold amount up to a specified amount beginning after December 25, 2008. 10 The ROP has provided a Performance Undertaking under which NIAs obligations under the Project Agreement are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the ROP. The Project Agreement and the Performance Undertaking provide for the resolution of disputes by binding arbitration in Singapore under international arbitration rules. NIAs obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenue. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations, including obligations pertaining to its outstanding debt. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company have guaranteed or will be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenue from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. The Companys cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million and $42.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company generated cash flows from operations of $124.8 million and $78.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to cash receipts from higher variable energy fees of $19.4 million, higher water delivery fees of $4.0 million due to the 7.5% contractual escalation factor, lower interest paid in 2006 of $6.4 million, reimbursements to the Company of $9.7 million for real property taxes paid in 2005 and value added tax recoveries of $3.4 million. The Company used $19.6 million and received $10.1 million for investing activities in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures were $1.9 million and $0.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations and dividends payable increased by $17.7 million in 2006, due primarily to the 15% of 2006 dividends and related interest which is deposited in an escrow account and shown as part of restricted cash and investments in the Balance Sheets. In 2005, restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations and dividends payable decreased by $10.6 million due to lower scheduled principal payments due in 2006. The Company used $115.6 million and $63.2 million for financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company declared dividends totaling $99.5 million in 2006 and $11.0 million in 2005 (of which $14.9 million and $1.7 million respectively, were placed in an escrow account in the name of the Company and shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the Balance Sheets). The Company repaid $36.0 million and $54.8 million on the balance of the Series A Notes and Series B Bonds in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys cash and cash equivalents were $42.3 million and $16.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company generated cash flows from operations of $78.7 million and $76.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher water delivery fees of $3.7 million due to the 7.5% contractual escalation factor, lower interest paid in 2005 of $ 6.5 million and the payment of property taxes of $9.2 million in 2005. The Company received $10.1 million and used $74.5 million for investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On January 14, 2004, the Company collected the $97.0 million ROP Note receivable obtained in connection with the NIA Arbitration Settlement. On April 14, 2004, the Company received $18.9 million pursuant to an arbitration settlement with the construction contractor. Capital expenditures were $0.5 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations decreased by $10.6 million in 2005 due to lower principal payments due in 2006. In 2004, restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations increased by $37.4 million to fully fund the Debt Service Reserve Fund. 11 The Company used $63.2 million and $139.1 million for financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company declared dividends totaling $11.0 million in 2005 and $106.0 million in 2004 (of which $1.7 million and $15.9 million, respectively were set aside in a separate bank account in the name of the Company and shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the Balance Sheets). The Company repaid $54.8 million and $49.4 million on the balance of the Series A Notes and Series B Bonds in 2005 and 2004, respectively. NIA Arbitration Settlement In connection with the NIA Arbitration Settlement on October 15, 2003, NIA delivered to CE Casecnan a $97.0 million ROP Note, which contained a put provision granting CE Casecnan the right to put the ROP Note to the ROP for a price of par plus accrued interest for a 30 day period commencing on January 14, 2004. On January 14, 2004, CE Casecnan exercised its right to put the ROP Note to the ROP and, in accordance with the terms of the put, CE Casecnan received $99.2 million (representing $97.0 million par value plus accrued interest) from the ROP on January 21, 2004. Casecnan Stockholder Litigation Pursuant to the share ownership adjustment mechanism in the CE Casecnan stockholder agreement, which is based upon proforma financial projections of the Casecnan Project prepared following commencement of commercial operations, in February 2002, MidAmericans indirect wholly owned subsidiary, CE Casecnan Ltd., advised the minority stockholder of the Company, LaPrairie Group Contractors (International) Ltd. (LPG), that MidAmericans indirect ownership interest in CE Casecnan had increased to 100% effective from commencement of commercial operations. On July 8, 2002, LPG filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, City and County of San Francisco against CE Casecnan Ltd. and MidAmerican. LPGs complaint, as amended, seeks compensatory and punitive damages arising out of CE Casecnan Ltd.s and MidAmericans alleged improper calculation of the proforma financial projections and alleged improper settlement of the NIA arbitration. The Company is not a defendant in the action. On January 21, 2004, CE Casecnan Ltd., LPG and the Company entered into a status quo agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to set aside certain distributions related to the shares subject to the LPG dispute and CE Casecnan agreed not to take any further actions with respect to such distributions without at least 15 days prior notice to LPG. Accordingly, 15% of the dividend declarations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, totaling $32.5 million, was set aside in a separate bank account in the name of the Company and is shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the accompanying Balance Sheets. On August 4, 2005, the court issued a decision, ruling in favor of LPG on five of the eight disputed issues in the first phase of the litigation. On September 12, 2005, LPG filed a motion seeking the release of the funds which have been set aside pursuant to the status quo agreement referred to above. MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. filed an opposition to the motion on October 3, 2005, and at the hearing on October 26, 2005, the court denied LPGs motion. On January 3, 2006, the court entered a judgment in favor of LPG against CE Casecnan Ltd. According to the judgment, LPG would retain its ownership of 15% of the shares of the Company and distributions of the amounts deposited into escrow plus interest at 9% per annum. On February 28, 2006, CE Casecnan Ltd. filed an appeal of this judgment and the August 4, 2005 decision. The appeal is fully briefed, was argued on January 4, 2007 and is expected to be resolved sometime in 2007. The parties are proceeding in the trial court on LPGs remaining claim against MidAmerican for damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty. This claim is expected to be resolved sometime in 2007. In February 2003, San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders and Developers Group, Inc. (San Lorenzo), an original shareholder substantially all of whose shares in the Company were purchased by MidAmerican in 1998, threatened to initiate legal action against the Company in the Philippines in connection with certain aspects of its option to repurchase such shares. The Company believes that San Lorenzo has no valid basis for any claim and, if named as a defendant in any action that may be commenced by San Lorenzo, the Company will vigorously defend such action. On July 1, 2005, MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. commenced an action against San Lorenzo in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, seeking a declaratory judgment as to MidAmericans and CE Casecnan Ltd.s rights vis vis San Lorenzo in respect of such shares. San Lorenzo filed a motion to dismiss on September 19, 2005. Subsequently, San Lorenzo purported to exercise its option to repurchase such shares. On January 30, 2006, San Lorenzo filed a counterclaim against MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. seeking declaratory relief that it has effectively exercised its option to purchase 15% of the shares of the Company, that it is the rightful owner of such shares and that it is due all dividends paid on such shares. On March 9, 2006, the court granted San Lorenzos motion to dismiss, but has since permitted MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. to file an amended complaint incorporating the purported exercise of the option. The complaint has been amended and the action is proceeding. The matter is currently in the early stages of discovery. The impact, if any, of San Lorenzos purported exercise of its option and the Nebraska litigation on the Company cannot be determined at this time. 12 Obligations and Commitments The Company has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition. Contractual obligations to make future payments arise from long term debt and notes payable. Material obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period 1 2 3 4 5 &gt;5 Total Year Years Years Years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 106,330 $ 37,730 $ 51,450 $ 17,150 $ Note payable (1) 51,263 51,263 Interest 86,079 30,909 21,402 12,589 21,179 Total contractual cash obligations $ 243,672 $ 68,639 $ 72,852 $ 29,739 $ 72,442 (1) The maturity date of the note is November 1, 2015. However, CE Casecnan Ltd. can demand payment of the outstanding principal amount at any time prior to the maturity date. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Companys assessment of the collectibility of payments from NIA. This assessment requires judgment regarding the outcome of disputes and the ability of the customer to pay the amounts owed to the Company. Any change in the Companys assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable that was not previously provided for could significantly impact the calculation of such allowance and the results of operations. Concentration of Risk NIAs payments of obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenues. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company will guarantee or be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenues from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. 13 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The following discussion of the Companys exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in the circumstances and in light of information currently available to the Company. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking information. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006, the Company had fixed rate long term debt of $106.3 million in principal amount and having a fair value of $113.8 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company had fixed rate long term debt of $142.3 million in principal amount and having a fair value of $153.4 million. These instruments are fixed rate and therefore do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately $1.3 million if interest rates were to increase by 10% from their levels at December 31, 2006. In general, such a decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. Credit Risk NIAs payments of obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenue. NIA must obtain U.S. Dollars to fund its payment obligations. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to obtain U.S. Dollars and fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company have guaranteed or will be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenue from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. 14

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following is managements discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Companys financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10 K. Factors Affecting the Results of Operations Seasonality The Casecnan Project is dependent upon sufficient rainfall to generate electricity and deliver water. The seasonality of rainfall patterns and the variability of rainfall from year to year, all of which are outside the control of the Company, have a material impact on the amounts of electricity generated and water delivered by the Casecnan Project. Rainfall has historically been highest from June through December and lowest from January through May. The contractual terms for water delivery fees and variable energy fees (described below) can produce significant variability in revenue between reporting periods. 8 Under the Supplemental Agreement, the water delivery fee is payable in a fixed monthly payment based upon an average annual water delivery of 801.9 million cubic meters, pro rated to approximately 66.8 million cubic meters per month, multiplied by the applicable per cubic meter rate through December 25, 2008. For each contract year starting from December 25, 2003 and ending on December 25, 2008, a water delivery fee credit (deferred revenue) is computed equal to 801.9 million cubic meters minus the greater of actual water deliveries or 700.0 million cubic meters the minimum threshold. The water delivery fee credit at the end of each contract year is available to be earned in the succeeding contract year through December 25, 2008. The cumulative water delivery fee credit at December 25, 2008, if any, shall be amortized from December 25, 2008 through December 25, 2013. Accordingly, in recognizing revenue, the water delivery fees are recorded each month pro rated to approximately 58.3 million cubic meters per month until the minimum threshold has been reached for the current contract year. Subsequent water delivery fees within the contract year are based on actual water delivered. The Company earns guaranteed energy fees based upon an assumed delivery of 19.0 GWh per month, at a rate of $0.1596 per kWh. The Company earns variable energy fees based upon actual energy delivered in each month in excess of 19.0 GWh, payable at a rate of $0.1509 per kWh. Starting in 2009, the kWh rate for energy deliveries in excess of 19.0 GWh per month is reduced to $0.1132, escalating at 1% per annum thereafter. Any deliveries of energy in excess of 490.0 GWh, but less than 550.0 GWh per year are paid at a rate of 1.3 pesos per kWh, reduced to 0.98 pesos starting 2009 and escalated at 1% per annum thereafter. Deliveries in excess of 550.0 GWh per year are at no cost to NIA. Within each contract year, no variable energy fees are payable until energy in excess of the cumulative 19.0 GWh per month for the contract year to date has been delivered. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 The following table provides certain operating data of the Casecnan Project for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Electricity produced (GWh) 538.5 406.5 Water delivered (million cubic meters) 996.0 723.0 For accounting purposes, the Project Agreement with NIA contains both an operating lease and a service contract, which the Company accounted for pursuant to provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Pursuant to the provisions of the Project Agreement, the Company earned water and energy fees as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 Water delivery fees $ 57.3 $ 53.3 Guaranteed energy fees 36.4 36.4 Variable energy fees 41.0 24.9 Deferred water delivery fees 13.8 (7.6 ) Total lease rentals and service contracts revenue $ 148.5 $ 107.0 Revenue for 2006 increased by $41.5 million to $148.5 million compared with 2005. The increase in water delivery fees was primarily due to the contractual 7.5% annual escalation factor. The higher variable energy fees in 2006 were due to higher generation for the year of 538.5 GWh compared to 406.5 GWh in 2005. Accumulated deferred water delivery fees in prior years were fully earned in 2006 due to high water deliveries which exceeded the 801.9 million cubic meters threshold. The higher generation and water deliveries were the result of above average rainfall in most months of 2006. Interest expense for 2006 decreased $3.4 million to $21.4 million compared with 2005, due primarily to lower outstanding debt balances resulting from the scheduled repayment of debt. Interest income for 2006 increased $1.1 million to $3.0 million compared with 2005, due to higher average cash balances and higher average interest rates on investments. 9 Other, net for 2006 increased $3.7 million to $4.0 million compared with 2005, due primarily to value added tax recoveries exceeding obligations as a result of a change in the value added tax law which became effective on November 1, 2005. The provision for income tax for 2006 increased $1.2 million to $2.3 million as income not subject to the income tax holiday was higher than in 2005. The income tax holiday is scheduled to expire in December 2007 after which all CE Casecnan income will become subject to income tax at the statutory rate of 35%. Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 The following table provides certain operating data of the Casecnan Project for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Electricity produced (GWh) 406.5 404.5 Water delivered (million cubic meters) 723.0 719.2 For accounting purposes, the Project Agreement with NIA contains both an operating lease and a service contract, which the Company accounted for pursuant to provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. Pursuant to the provisions of the Project Agreement, the Company earned water and energy fees as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 Water delivery fees $ 53.3 $ 49.6 Guaranteed energy fees 36.4 36.4 Variable energy fees 24.9 26.9 Deferred water delivery fees (7.6 ) (6.1 ) Total lease rentals and service contracts revenue $ 107.0 $ 106.8 Revenue for 2005 increased by $0.2 illion to $107.0 illion compared with 2004. The increase in water delivery fees and deferred water delivery fees was primarily due to the contractual 7.5% annual escalation factor. Differences between calendar year operations and contract year invoicing resulted in lower variable energy fees in 2005 compared to 2004 despite marginally higher total energy production during the calendar year. The monthly billing cycle runs from the 25th day of a given calendar month to the 25th day of the following month. Within each billing cycle, the Casecnan Project must produce 19.0 GWh of electricity before it can earn variable energy fees. The electricity generated by heavy water flows in the last six days of the December 2005 (the start of the new billing cycle) did not generate any variable energy fees in calendar year 2005. Operating expenses for 2005 decreased by $2.1 illion to $31.3 illion compared with 2004. Road maintenance was $0.7 million lower in 2005 due to damage caused by typhoons in 2004. Engineering and consulting expenses were $0.7 million lower in 2005 due to plant optimization activities in 2004 and the construction contract arbitration settlement in April 2004. Depreciation expense decreased by $0.5 million in 2005 due to the lower depreciable base resulting from the construction contract arbitration settlement in April 2004. Interest expense for 2005 decreased $4.7 million to $24.8 million compared with 2004, due primarily to lower outstanding debt balances resulting from the scheduled repayment of debt. The provision for income tax for 2005 increased by $1.0 million to $1.1 million compared with 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.7 million on interest income earned outside the Philippines. Liquidity and Capital Resources CE Casecnan constructed and operates the Casecnan Project, which was developed as an unsolicited proposal under the Philippine build own operate transfer law, pursuant to the terms of the Project Agreement. CE Casecnan is registered with the Philippine Board of Investments as a new operator of hydroelectric power plant with pioneer status under the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 226). Under the terms of its registration, CE Casecnan is entitled to certain incentives which include an income tax holiday for six years from the start of commercial operations, tax and duty free importation of capital equipment, tax credits on domestic capital equipment, and exemption from customs duties and national internal revenue taxes for the importation and unrestricted use of the consigned equipment for the development, construction, start up, testing and operation of the power plant. CE Casecnan developed, financed and constructed the Casecnan Project over the construction period, and owns and operates the Casecnan Project for the term of the Cooperation Period, which commenced on December 11, 2001. During the Cooperation Period, NIA is obligated to accept all deliveries of water and energy, and so long as the Casecnan Project is physically capable of operating and delivering in accordance with agreed levels set forth in the Project Agreement, NIA is obligated to pay CE Casecnan a fixed fee for the delivery of a threshold volume of water and a fixed fee for the delivery of a threshold amount of electricity. In addition, NIA is obligated to pay a fee for all electricity delivered in excess of the threshold amount up to a specified amount and will be obligated to pay a fee for all water delivered in excess of the threshold amount up to a specified amount beginning after December 25, 2008. 10 The ROP has provided a Performance Undertaking under which NIAs obligations under the Project Agreement are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the ROP. The Project Agreement and the Performance Undertaking provide for the resolution of disputes by binding arbitration in Singapore under international arbitration rules. NIAs obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenue. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations, including obligations pertaining to its outstanding debt. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company have guaranteed or will be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenue from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. The Companys cash and cash equivalents were $31.9 million and $42.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company generated cash flows from operations of $124.8 million and $78.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to cash receipts from higher variable energy fees of $19.4 million, higher water delivery fees of $4.0 million due to the 7.5% contractual escalation factor, lower interest paid in 2006 of $6.4 million, reimbursements to the Company of $9.7 million for real property taxes paid in 2005 and value added tax recoveries of $3.4 million. The Company used $19.6 million and received $10.1 million for investing activities in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures were $1.9 million and $0.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations and dividends payable increased by $17.7 million in 2006, due primarily to the 15% of 2006 dividends and related interest which is deposited in an escrow account and shown as part of restricted cash and investments in the Balance Sheets. In 2005, restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations and dividends payable decreased by $10.6 million due to lower scheduled principal payments due in 2006. The Company used $115.6 million and $63.2 million for financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company declared dividends totaling $99.5 million in 2006 and $11.0 million in 2005 (of which $14.9 million and $1.7 million respectively, were placed in an escrow account in the name of the Company and shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the Balance Sheets). The Company repaid $36.0 million and $54.8 million on the balance of the Series A Notes and Series B Bonds in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys cash and cash equivalents were $42.3 million and $16.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company generated cash flows from operations of $78.7 million and $76.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher water delivery fees of $3.7 million due to the 7.5% contractual escalation factor, lower interest paid in 2005 of $ 6.5 million and the payment of property taxes of $9.2 million in 2005. The Company received $10.1 million and used $74.5 million for investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On January 14, 2004, the Company collected the $97.0 million ROP Note receivable obtained in connection with the NIA Arbitration Settlement. On April 14, 2004, the Company received $18.9 million pursuant to an arbitration settlement with the construction contractor. Capital expenditures were $0.5 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations decreased by $10.6 million in 2005 due to lower principal payments due in 2006. In 2004, restricted cash and investments for debt service obligations increased by $37.4 million to fully fund the Debt Service Reserve Fund. 11 The Company used $63.2 million and $139.1 million for financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company declared dividends totaling $11.0 million in 2005 and $106.0 million in 2004 (of which $1.7 million and $15.9 million, respectively were set aside in a separate bank account in the name of the Company and shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the Balance Sheets). The Company repaid $54.8 million and $49.4 million on the balance of the Series A Notes and Series B Bonds in 2005 and 2004, respectively. NIA Arbitration Settlement In connection with the NIA Arbitration Settlement on October 15, 2003, NIA delivered to CE Casecnan a $97.0 million ROP Note, which contained a put provision granting CE Casecnan the right to put the ROP Note to the ROP for a price of par plus accrued interest for a 30 day period commencing on January 14, 2004. On January 14, 2004, CE Casecnan exercised its right to put the ROP Note to the ROP and, in accordance with the terms of the put, CE Casecnan received $99.2 million (representing $97.0 million par value plus accrued interest) from the ROP on January 21, 2004. Casecnan Stockholder Litigation Pursuant to the share ownership adjustment mechanism in the CE Casecnan stockholder agreement, which is based upon proforma financial projections of the Casecnan Project prepared following commencement of commercial operations, in February 2002, MidAmericans indirect wholly owned subsidiary, CE Casecnan Ltd., advised the minority stockholder of the Company, LaPrairie Group Contractors (International) Ltd. (LPG), that MidAmericans indirect ownership interest in CE Casecnan had increased to 100% effective from commencement of commercial operations. On July 8, 2002, LPG filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, City and County of San Francisco against CE Casecnan Ltd. and MidAmerican. LPGs complaint, as amended, seeks compensatory and punitive damages arising out of CE Casecnan Ltd.s and MidAmericans alleged improper calculation of the proforma financial projections and alleged improper settlement of the NIA arbitration. The Company is not a defendant in the action. On January 21, 2004, CE Casecnan Ltd., LPG and the Company entered into a status quo agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to set aside certain distributions related to the shares subject to the LPG dispute and CE Casecnan agreed not to take any further actions with respect to such distributions without at least 15 days prior notice to LPG. Accordingly, 15% of the dividend declarations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, totaling $32.5 million, was set aside in a separate bank account in the name of the Company and is shown as restricted cash and investments and dividends payable in the accompanying Balance Sheets. On August 4, 2005, the court issued a decision, ruling in favor of LPG on five of the eight disputed issues in the first phase of the litigation. On September 12, 2005, LPG filed a motion seeking the release of the funds which have been set aside pursuant to the status quo agreement referred to above. MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. filed an opposition to the motion on October 3, 2005, and at the hearing on October 26, 2005, the court denied LPGs motion. On January 3, 2006, the court entered a judgment in favor of LPG against CE Casecnan Ltd. According to the judgment, LPG would retain its ownership of 15% of the shares of the Company and distributions of the amounts deposited into escrow plus interest at 9% per annum. On February 28, 2006, CE Casecnan Ltd. filed an appeal of this judgment and the August 4, 2005 decision. The appeal is fully briefed, was argued on January 4, 2007 and is expected to be resolved sometime in 2007. The parties are proceeding in the trial court on LPGs remaining claim against MidAmerican for damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty. This claim is expected to be resolved sometime in 2007. In February 2003, San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders and Developers Group, Inc. (San Lorenzo), an original shareholder substantially all of whose shares in the Company were purchased by MidAmerican in 1998, threatened to initiate legal action against the Company in the Philippines in connection with certain aspects of its option to repurchase such shares. The Company believes that San Lorenzo has no valid basis for any claim and, if named as a defendant in any action that may be commenced by San Lorenzo, the Company will vigorously defend such action. On July 1, 2005, MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. commenced an action against San Lorenzo in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, seeking a declaratory judgment as to MidAmericans and CE Casecnan Ltd.s rights vis vis San Lorenzo in respect of such shares. San Lorenzo filed a motion to dismiss on September 19, 2005. Subsequently, San Lorenzo purported to exercise its option to repurchase such shares. On January 30, 2006, San Lorenzo filed a counterclaim against MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. seeking declaratory relief that it has effectively exercised its option to purchase 15% of the shares of the Company, that it is the rightful owner of such shares and that it is due all dividends paid on such shares. On March 9, 2006, the court granted San Lorenzos motion to dismiss, but has since permitted MidAmerican and CE Casecnan Ltd. to file an amended complaint incorporating the purported exercise of the option. The complaint has been amended and the action is proceeding. The matter is currently in the early stages of discovery. The impact, if any, of San Lorenzos purported exercise of its option and the Nebraska litigation on the Company cannot be determined at this time. 12 Obligations and Commitments The Company has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition. Contractual obligations to make future payments arise from long term debt and notes payable. Material obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period 1 2 3 4 5 &gt;5 Total Year Years Years Years Contractual cash obligations: Long term debt $ 106,330 $ 37,730 $ 51,450 $ 17,150 $ Note payable (1) 51,263 51,263 Interest 86,079 30,909 21,402 12,589 21,179 Total contractual cash obligations $ 243,672 $ 68,639 $ 72,852 $ 29,739 $ 72,442 (1) The maturity date of the note is November 1, 2015. However, CE Casecnan Ltd. can demand payment of the outstanding principal amount at any time prior to the maturity date. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled in the future. Amounts recognized in the financial statements from such estimates are necessarily based on numerous assumptions involving varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty. Accordingly, the amounts currently reflected in the financial statements will likely increase or decrease in the future as additional information becomes available. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Companys assessment of the collectibility of payments from NIA. This assessment requires judgment regarding the outcome of disputes and the ability of the customer to pay the amounts owed to the Company. Any change in the Companys assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable that was not previously provided for could significantly impact the calculation of such allowance and the results of operations. Concentration of Risk NIAs payments of obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenues. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company will guarantee or be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenues from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. 13 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The following discussion of the Companys exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in the circumstances and in light of information currently available to the Company. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking information. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006, the Company had fixed rate long term debt of $106.3 million in principal amount and having a fair value of $113.8 million. At December 31, 2005, the Company had fixed rate long term debt of $142.3 million in principal amount and having a fair value of $153.4 million. These instruments are fixed rate and therefore do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately $1.3 million if interest rates were to increase by 10% from their levels at December 31, 2006. In general, such a decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity. Credit Risk NIAs payments of obligations under the Project Agreement are substantially denominated in U.S. Dollars and are the Companys sole source of operating revenue. NIA must obtain U.S. Dollars to fund its payment obligations. Because of the Companys dependence on NIA, any material failure of NIA to obtain U.S. Dollars and fulfill its obligations under the Project Agreement and any material failure of the ROP to fulfill its obligations under the Performance Undertaking would significantly impair the ability of the Company to meet its existing and future obligations. No stockholders, partners or affiliates of the Company, including MidAmerican, and no directors, officers or employees of the Company have guaranteed or will be in any way liable for payment of the Companys obligations. As a result, payment of the Companys obligations depends upon the availability of sufficient revenue from the Companys business after the payment of operating expenses. 14
