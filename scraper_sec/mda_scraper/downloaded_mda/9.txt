ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the 3 years ended December 31, 2002, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. See "Forward Looking Statements" for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Overview Our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. We previously reported 8 business segments, which included our corporate operations and the operations of each one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. In order to better reflect our operations as a diversified media company, and to reflect certain changes in the way our management receives internal financial information, we determined it appropriate under Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," to aggregate previously reported segments and identify new segments by type of business rather than by names of individual operating entities. As a result, we changed our reportable business segments in 2002 to the following: (i) publishing; (ii) broadcasting; (iii) telecommunications; (iv) printing services; and (v) other. Our publishing segment consists of a daily newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and more than 90 community newspapers and shoppers. Our broadcasting segment consists of 36 radio stations and 6 television stations in 11 states. Our telecommunications segment consists of wholesale and business to business telecommunications services provided through a high speed fiber optic telecommunications network that covers more than 4,400 route miles in 7 states. Our printing services segment reflects the operations of our printing and assembly and fulfillment business. Our other segment consists of a label printing business and a direct marketing services business. Also included in other are corporate expenses and eliminations. Acquisition and Sale On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho. The cash purchase price for the stations was approximately $22.1 million. On March 2, 2001, we sold certain assets of the Milwaukee operation of our label printing business. The cash sale price was approximately $4.4 million. Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2002 was $801.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 0.9%, compared to $808.8 million in 2001. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2002 were $447.6 million, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 3.5%, compared to $463.7 million in 2001. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2002 were $239.7 million, a decrease of $21.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to $261.0 million in 2001. 26 The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Revenue 2001 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 311.1 38.8% $ 320.6 39.6% Broadcasting..................................... 152.8 19.1 134.8 16.7 Telecommunications............................... 148.7 18.6 152.0 18.8 Printing services................................ 97.8 12.2 114.6 14.2 Other............................................ 91.0 11.3 86.8 10.7 Total operating revenue..................... 801.4 100.0 808.8 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 447.6 55.9 463.7 57.3 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 239.7 29.9 261.0 32.3 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 687.3 85.8 724.7 89.6 Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 14.2% $ 84.1 10.4% The decrease in total operating revenue was primarily due to the decrease in classified advertising in our publishing businesses, service disconnections and price reductions in our telecommunications business and the consolidation of our U. S. printing services operations and the continued slowdown in our publication printing services business. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Olympic, political and issue advertising in our television broadcasting business. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The decrease in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives. Our consolidated operating earnings in 2002 were $114.1 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 35.6%, compared to $84.1 million in 2001. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Earnings 2001 Earnings (in millions) Publishing....................................... $ 30.3 26.6% $ 24.9 29.6% Broadcasting..................................... 33.4 29.3 15.5 18.4 Telecommunications............................... 41.0 35.9 48.0 57.1 Printing services................................ 2.1 1.8 (0.8) (0.9) Other............................................ 7.3 6.4 (3.5) (4.2) Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 100.0% $ 84.1 100.0% The increase in total operating earnings was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives, workforce reductions and the closure or transition of certain business units, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the adverse impact on third quarter 2001 earnings following the September 11 terrorist attacks offset by the decrease in the profit margin on telecommunication services. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and, accordingly, we ceased amortizing goodwill, broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements. If Statement No. 142 had been adopted effective January 1, 2001, our total operating earnings would have been $92.1 million. 27 Our consolidated EBITDA in 2002 was $160.7 million, an increase of $24.9 million, or 18.3%, compared to $135.8 million in 2001. EBITDA is defined as operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization. We believe the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Our management uses EBITDA, among other things, to evaluate our operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, our lenders use EBITDA to measure our ability to service our debt. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use. The following table presents a reconciliation of our operating earnings to EBITDA by segment for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Depreciation Percent of Depreciation Percent of Operating and Total Operating and Total Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA (in millions) Publishing................. $ 30.3 $ 14.2 $ 44.5 27.7% $ 24.9 $ 13.9 $ 38.8 28.6% Broadcasting............... 33.4 7.3 40.7 25.3 15.5 13.3 28.8 21.2 Telecommunications......... 41.0 17.1 58.1 36.2 48.0 14.7 62.7 46.2 Printing services.......... 2.1 5.2 7.3 4.5 (0.8) 6.2 5.4 4.0 Other...................... 7.3 2.8 10.1 6.3 (3.5) 3.6 0.1 Total...................... $ 114.1 $ 46.6 $160.7 100.0% $ 84.1 $ 51.7 $ 135.8 100.0% The increase in total EBITDA was primarily due to increases in operating earnings in our publishing, broadcasting, printing services and other reportable segments offset by a decrease in our telecommunications segment. Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2002 was $311.1 million, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 3.0%, compared to $320.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from publishing were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. EBITDA from publishing in 2002 was $44.5 million, an increase of $5.7 million, or 14.6%, compared to $38.8 million in 2001 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Operating earnings............. $ 28.7 $ 1.6 $ 30.3 $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 EBITDA......................... $ 38.5 $ 6.0 $ 44.5 $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 28 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 75.5 $ 56.9 $ 132.4 $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 Classified................ 62.4 9.8 72.2 67.9 10.9 78.8 General................... 10.1 10.1 9.7 9.7 Other..................... 15.9 1.5 17.4 14.1 1.4 15.5 Total advertising revenue. 163.9 68.2 232.1 166.3 68.0 234.3 Circulation revenue............ 45.3 3.2 48.5 48.1 3.3 51.4 Other revenue.................. 3.7 26.8 30.5 4.4 30.5 34.9 Total operating revenue........ $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Advertising revenue in 2002 accounted for 74.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.1% in 2001. Retail advertising revenue in 2002 was $132.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to $130.3 million in 2001. The increase is comprised of a $3.0 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints and a $1.2 million increase in community newspaper retail advertising and inserts, in part due to rate increases, offset by a $2.1 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP (run of press) advertisements. We believe the shift toward retail preprints in 2002 was due in part to changes in marketing strategies of certain major national retail advertisers. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2002 was $72.2 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 8.4%, compared to $78.8 million in 2001. At the daily newspaper, decreases in employment advertising of $8.6 million and real estate advertising of $0.1 million were partially offset by increases in automotive advertising of $2.8 million and general advertising of $0.4 million. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 37.5% of total classified advertising in 2002, represented a 27.0% decrease from 2001. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic uncertainty; however, with each quarter in 2002 compared to 2001, the decrease in total classified advertising has reduced. The increase in automotive advertising is primarily attributed to auto manufacturers promoting 0% financing programs. General advertising revenue in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.1%, compared to $9.7 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in general ROP advertising mainly from our telecommunications customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 773.6 812.0 4.7% Classified...................................... 922.4 970.6 5.0% General......................................... 52.7 51.1 + 3.1% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,748.7 1,833.7 4.7% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 773.5 719.5 + 7.5% Total advertising linage in 2002 decreased 4.7% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 5.0% decrease in classified advertising and a 4.7% decrease in retail advertising partially offset by a 3.1% increase in general advertising. The decrease in classified advertising lineage is consistent with the decrease in the classified advertising revenue. Retail advertising linage decreased while preprint advertising pieces rose 7.5% primarily as a result of the shift to preprint advertising from a major national retail customer. 29 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 93,888 94,898 1.1% Shoppers........................................ 105,545 113,846 7.3% Total full pages of advertising...................... 199,433 208,744 4.5% Revenue per page..................................... $ 305.86 $ 288.61 + 6.0% Total pages of full page advertising in 2002 decreased 4.5% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 7.3% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 1.1% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 6.0% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline and event marketing, in 2002 was $17.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.3%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2002 accounted for 15.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 16.0% in 2001. Circulation revenue in 2002 was $48.5 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.6%, compared to $51.4 million in 2001. The decrease was mainly attributed to the 4.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels weekday edition and 3.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels Sunday edition, a 3.5% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers and greater discounts given to new subscribers. In January 2002, we eliminated home delivery of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in all but 12 counties in southeastern Wisconsin. As of the end of 2002, this decision contributed to a decrease in net paid circulation for the daily and Sunday edition of 3.6% and 4.9%, respectively. On June 30, 2002, in an effort to increase readership in certain areas of Milwaukee County, we began offering greater discounts on home delivery and single copy sales. Circulation in those areas has increased since offering the discounts. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing opportunities at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2002 accounted for 9.8% of total publishing revenue compared to 10.9% in 2001. Other revenue in 2002 was $30.5 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 12.6%, compared to $34.9 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers and the loss of 3 commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2002 were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. Contributing to the increase was a $12.3 million reduction in the cost of newsprint and ink compared to 2001 and a $6.8 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. These cost reductions were partially offset by $4.6 million in start up costs in 2002 related to the new production facility. We anticipate that our new production facility will be fully operational in early 2003. We expect that our new presses will provide improved print reproduction quality and increased productivity, as well as additional opportunities to pursue commercial printing revenue from third parties. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has resulted in our daily newspaper using more newsprint and experiencing a temporary increase in single copy circulation. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2002 was $152.7 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 13.3%, compared to $134.8 million in 2001. Operating earnings from broadcasting in 2002 were $33.4 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 116.0%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. EBITDA from broadcasting in 2002 was $40.7 million, an increase of $12.0 million, or 41.8%, compared to $28.7 million in 2001 (see page28 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain of the assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho, for approximately $22.1 million in cash. We began operating the stations on January 1, 2002. 30 The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 78.2 $ 74.5 $ 152.7 $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 Operating earnings............. $ 15.2 $ 18.2 $ 33.4 $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 EBITDA......................... $ 18.2 $ 22.5 $ 40.7 $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2002 was $78.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 5.8%, compared to $73.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $2.9 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.7 million increase from national advertising revenue across most markets, and a $0.7 million increase in political and issue advertising revenue. These increases in advertising revenue from the radio stations reflect a $0.5 million adverse impact in 2001 from advertising cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2002 were $15.2 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 157.6%, compared to $5.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the discontinuation of $5.7 million of goodwill and broadcast license amortization expense, the $4.3 million increase in revenue and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives at all of our radio stations. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2002 was $74.5 million, an increase of $13.6 million, or 22.3%, compared to $60.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $7.8 million increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $4.6 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $1.5 million increase in national advertising revenue. Included in the revenue increase is $5.3 million from the 2 stations in Idaho that were acquired on December 31, 2001. These increases in advertising revenue from the television stations reflect in part the $1.3 million adverse impact in 2001 of the loss of advertising spots during the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2002 were $18.2 million, an increase of $8.6 million, or 89.6%, compared to $9.6 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the $13.6 million increase in revenue, the discontinuation of $1.0 million of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the effects of cost control initiatives at all of our television stations. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has had a negative impact on our broadcast results due to reduced spending levels by some advertisers. There was a hesitancy on the part of some advertisers to place schedules during the period of time leading up to the war, cancellations by some advertisers for the duration of war coverage and elimination of advertising inventory available from our television networks during their continuous coverage of the war. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2002 was $148.7 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 2.2%, compared to $152.0 million in 2001. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2002 were $41.0 million, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 14.7%, compared to $48.0 million in 2001. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2002 was $58.1 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 7.3%, compared to $62.7 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Wholesale telecommunication services provide network transmission solutions for other service providers by offering bulk transmission capacity. Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2002 was $97.3 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 5.2%, compared to $102.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to service disconnections and price reductions. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2002 was $7.5 million compared to $8.1 million at the beginning of 2002 and $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $1.3 million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Commercial telecommunication services provide advanced data communications and long distance service to small and medium sized businesses in the Upper Midwest, principally in Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota and Illinois. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2002 was $51.4 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.0%, compared to $49.4 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in long distance services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial advanced data services at the end of 2002 of $3.0 million was virtually equal to the amount at the beginning of 2002 and $0.2 million higher than the $2.8 31 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.7 million in monthly recurring revenue were offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to service disconnections, the decrease in profit margins on services provided due to price reductions and the increase in depreciation expense of $2.5 million resulting from the completion of several capital investment initiatives during 2001. We expect continued service disconnections and price reductions in our wholesale telecommunications business will cause an increasing downward trend that could result in a significant decrease in our telecommunications operating earnings into 2003. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 20.1% and 22.5% of our telecommunications revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2002 and WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2002. We have a pre bankruptcy receivable, net of applicable "set off" accounts payable, from WorldCom of $0.5 million. We recorded a reserve in the amount of the net receivable in the third quarter of 2002. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. A renewal service contract with Global Crossing is being negotiated, though Global Crossing retains the right to accept or reject our current contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy. Global Crossing is currently expected to exit from bankruptcy in May 2003. WorldCom also has a right to accept or reject our contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy, which is not currently expected to happen before late 2003 or 2004. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. We continue to provide services to WorldCom and Global Crossing and receive timely payment for those services. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2002 was $97.8 million, a decrease of $16.8 million, or 14.6%, compared to $114.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from printing services in 2002 were $2.1 million, an increase of $2.9 million, compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2001. EBITDA from printing services in 2002 was $7.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 35.2%, compared to $5.4 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The decrease in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to the consolidation of our U.S. operations to eliminate customers that did not fit our long term strategic business plans and continued slowdown in the publication printing services business. CD ROM replication continued at essentially the same level as in the prior year; however, we continue to experience intense price competition for this product in all markets. The increase in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to a reduction in operational costs and an increase in the sale of products with higher margins. These were partially offset by the decrease in revenue and a $2.5 million loss on impairment of CD ROM related equipment. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 37.6% and 29.8% of our printing services revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On February 4, 2003, we announced the closure of our CD ROM mastering and replications operations. We do not expect the costs to close these operations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Other Other operating revenue in 2002 was $91.0 million, an increase of $4.2 million, or 4.8%, compared to $86.8 million in 2001. Other operating earnings in 2002 were $7.3 million, an increase of $10.8 million compared to losses of $3.5 million in 2001. Other EBITDA in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $10.0 million, compared to $0.1 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). 32 The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 56.5 $ 38.3 $ (3.8) $ 91.0 $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 Operating earnings........... $ 2.4 $ (0.1) $ 5.0 $ 7.3 $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) EBITDA....................... $ 4.2 $ 0.5 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 The increase in other operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in the gravure label printing operation of new label products for our largest label printing customer, SAB/Miller Brewing Company, and in print and mail services and database marketing services in our direct marketing services business. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services is $21.6 million and $21.3 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the September 11 terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing the amount of direct mail. The increase in other operating earnings was primarily attributed to the decrease in the litigation reserve by $4.1 million to reflect the settlement of the Newspaper Merger Class Action Suit (discussed in Note 8 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the $3.2 million increase in operating revenue from our label printing and direct marketing services businesses, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives and the discontinuation of $0.4 million of goodwill amortization expense partially offset by the $1.3 million loss on impairment of a customer list at our direct marketing services business. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for 50.7% and 47.4% of our label printing business revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, our label printing business was in the second year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2002 were $1.0 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 37.5%, compared to $1.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents offset by interest income received from refunds of state income taxes. Interest expense in 2002 was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million in 2001. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2002 was $1.8 million compared to $0.5 million in 2001. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel production facility in 2002 was $1.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2001. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 43.2% in 2002 compared to 42.0% in 2001. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the litigation that was settled during 2002. Discontinued Operations In January 2002, we announced the closure of the Fox Cities Newspapers, located in Appleton, Wisconsin, which published 6 community newspapers. These community newspapers were part of the publishing reportable segment. On April 29, 2002, the board of directors of our French printing services subsidiary, IPC Communication Services, S.A., a business in our printing services segment, approved a resolution to proceed to close IPC Communication Services, S.A. through a liquidation process. The remaining operations of IPC Communication Services, S.A., were turned over to a liquidator on December 31, 2002. The operations of the Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A. have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, prior periods have been restated to reflect this treatment. Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2002 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 78.3%, compared to $15.2 million in 2001. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2002 were zero and $3.3 million at December 31, 2001. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 was $7.2 million compared to $2.2 million in 2001. Applicable income tax benefits were $6.6 million and $0.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 33 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under Statement No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, including broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements, are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations when their carrying amounts exceed their estimated fair values. We performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7,670 ($6,509 after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statements of earnings. 2001 compared to 2000 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2001 was $808.8 million, a decrease of $10.4 million, or 1.3%, compared to $819.2 million in 2000. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2001 were $463.7 million, an increase of $16.4 million, or 3.7%, compared to $447.3 million in 2000. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2001 were $261.0 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 0.1%, compared to $262.7 million in 2000. The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2001 and 2000: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2001 Revenue 2000 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 320.6 39.6% $ 345.3 42.1% Broadcasting..................................... 134.8 16.7 149.9 18.3 Telecommunications............................... 152.0 18.8 126.6 15.5 Printing services................................ 114.6 14.2 107.3 13.1 Other............................................ 86.8 10.7 90.1 11.0 Total operating revenue..................... 808.8 100.0 819.2 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 463.7 57.3 447.3 54.6 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 261.0 32.3 262.7 32.1 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 724.7 89.6 710.0 86.7 Total operating earnings......................... $ 84.1 10.4% $ 109.2 13.3% The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the decrease in advertising revenue in our publishing business and the decrease in television operating revenue due to the decline in political and issue advertising and the economic downturn offset by the increase in telecommunications operating revenue attributed to new sales opportunities and network expansion. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted television news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The increase in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost of workforce reduction and business transition charges, the increase in the cost of raw materials other than newsprint and the increase in the cost of payroll and benefits. 34 Our operating earnings in 2001 were $84.1 million, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 23.0%, compared to $109.2 million in 2000.

Our consolidated EBITDA in 2001 was $135.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 14.8%, compared to $159.3 million in 2000.

Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2001 was $320.6 million, a decrease of $24.7 million, or 7.2%, compared to $345.3 million in 2000. Operating earnings from publishing were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.4 million, or 36.6%, compared to $39.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from publishing in 2001 was $38.8 million, a decrease of $14.7 million, or 27.5%, compared to $53.5 million in 2000 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Operating earnings............. $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 $ 38.4 $ 0.9 $ 39.3 EBITDA......................... $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 $ 46.5 $ 7.0 $ 53.5 35 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 $ 74.2 $ 56.8 $ 131.0 Classified................ 67.9 10.9 78.8 85.4 12.1 97.5 General................... 9.7 9.7 10.9 10.9 Other..................... 14.1 1.4 15.5 13.3 1.4 14.7 Total advertising revenue. 166.3 68.0 234.3 183.8 70.3 254.1 Circulation revenue............ 48.1 3.3 51.4 48.3 3.5 51.8 Other revenue.................. 4.4 30.5 34.9 4.9 34.5 39.4 Total operating revenue........ $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Advertising revenue in 2001 accounted for 73.1% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.6% in 2000. Retail advertising revenue in 2001 was $130.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.5%, compared to $131.0 million in 2000. The decrease is comprised of a $1.1 million decrease in community newspapers retail advertising and a $0.4 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP advertisements offset by a $0.8 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints. We believe certain major national retail advertisers have changed their marketing strategies and have shifted toward retail preprints. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2001 was $78.8 million, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 19.2%, compared to $97.5 million in 2000. At the daily newspaper, the decrease in employment advertising of $19.4 million was partially offset by increases in real estate advertising, automotive advertising and general advertising. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 47.7% of total classified advertising in 2001, represented a 37.5% decrease from 2000. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic weakness. General advertising revenue in 2001 was $9.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 11.0%, compared to $10.9 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in general ROP and preprint advertising mainly from our airline customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 812.0 811.5 0.1% Classified...................................... 970.6 1,164.3 16.6% General......................................... 51.1 63.6 19.7% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,833.7 2,039.4 10.0% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 719.5 665.7 + 8.1% Total advertising linage in 2001 decreased 10.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 16.6% decrease in classified advertising, an 0.1% decrease in retail advertising and a 19.7% decrease in general advertising. Retail advertising linage decreased primarily as a result of the shift in major retail advertising to more preprint advertising. Preprint advertising pieces rose 8.1% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in preprint advertising from major national retail customers. 36 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 94,898 111,440 14.8% Shoppers........................................ 113,846 134,057 15.1% Total full pages of advertising...................... 208,744 245,497 15.0% Revenue per page..................................... $ 288.61 $ 258.94 + 11.5% Total pages of full page advertising in 2001 decreased 15.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 15.1% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 14.8% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 11.5% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline, event marketing, legal notices and Internet products in 2001 was $15.5 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 5.4%, compared to $14.7 million in 2000. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2001 accounted for 16.0% of total publishing revenue compared to 15.0% in 2000. Circulation revenue in 2001 was $51.4 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.8%, compared to $51.8 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly attributed to a 7.4% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels weekday edition, a 1.6% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels Sunday edition and a 4.7% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2001 accounted for 10.9% of total publishing revenue compared to 11.4% in 2000. Other revenue in 2001 was $34.9 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 11.4%, compared to $39.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2001 were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.3 million, or 36.5%, compared to $39.2 million in 2000. Contributing to the decrease was a $24.7 million decrease in the total publishing operating revenue and $3.3 million in workforce reductions partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in the cost of newsprint and ink and a $8.4 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2001 was $134.8 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 10.1%, compared to $149.9 million in 2000. Operating earnings in 2001 were $15.5 million, a decrease of $14.9 million, or 49.0%, compared to $30.4 million in 2000. EBITDA in 2001 was $28.7 million, a decrease of $15.3 million, or 34.8%, compared to $44.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 $ 73.5 $ 76.4 $ 149.9 Operating earnings............. $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 $ 5.0 $ 25.4 $ 30.4 EBITDA......................... $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 $ 14.4 $ 29.6 $ 44.0 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2001 was $73.9 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%, compared to $73.5 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to a $0.7 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.6 million increase in network and other revenue offset by a $0.6 million decrease in political and issue advertising revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in national advertising revenue. These changes in advertising revenue from the radio stations in 2001 reflect the $0.5 million adverse impact from cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. 37 Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2001 were $5.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 18.0%, compared to $5.0 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the $0.4 million increase in revenue and the $1.0 million decrease in payroll costs and other selling expenses. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2001 was $60.9 million, a decrease of $15.5 million, or 20.3%, compared to $76.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $9.1 million decrease in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $3.6 million decrease in local advertising revenue and a $2.5 million decrease from national advertising revenue across all markets. Of these decreases in advertising revenue from the television stations in 2001, $1.3 million was due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2001 were $9.6 million, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 62.2%, compared to $25.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to the $15.5 million decrease in revenue. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2001 was $152.0 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 20.1%, compared to $126.6 million in 2000. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2001 were $48.0 million, an increase of $7.9 million, or 19.7%, compared to $40.1 million in 2000. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2001 was $62.7 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 21.7%, compared to $51.5 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2001 was $102.6 million, an increase of $18.4 million, or 21.9%, compared to $84.2 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to strong demand for our services and the network expansion into Michigan and Indiana. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2001 was $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $5.5 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $2.9 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2001 was $49.4 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 16.5%, compared to $42.4 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in data services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial data services at the end of 2001 was $3.0 million compared to $2.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $2.4 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.8 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The increase in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to the $25.4 million increase in revenue offset by a decrease in profit margins due to price reductions. We expect continued price reductions and service disconnections will cause a downward trend in earnings in 2002. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 22.5% and 23.7% of our telecommunications operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2001 was $114.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 6.8%, compared to $107.3 million in 2000. The operating loss from printing services in 2001 was $0.8 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, compared to earnings of $3.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from printing services was $5.4 million in 2001, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 46.0%, compared to $10.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The increase in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in assembly services. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily attributed to $2.3 million in expense related to the transition of the Eastern and Western Regions into one operational unit called IPC U.S. Operations and $0.7 million in costs related to the shutdown of operations in Ireland. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 29.8% and 24.4% of our printing services revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 38 Other Other operating revenue in 2001 was $86.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 3.7%, compared to $90.1 million in 2000. Other operating losses in 2001 were $3.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 11.6%, compared to losses of $4.0 million in 2000. Other EBITDA in 2001 was $0.1 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 $ 59.6 $ 34.3 $ (3.8) $ 90.1 Operating earnings........... $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) $ (0.9) $ 0.1 $ (3.2) $ (4.0) EBITDA....................... $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 $ 1.6 $ 1.3 $ (2.6) $ 0.3 The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the March 2001 sale of the Milwaukee label printing business offset by the increase in print and mail services in our direct marketing services business. Operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing their use of direct mail. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services was $21.3 million and $19.7 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001 and 2000, the operating losses were primarily attributed to an increase in the litigation reserve. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for approximately 47.4% and 27.5% of our label printing operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001, our label printing business was in the first year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2001 were $1.6 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 23.1%, compared to $1.3 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the increase in cash available for commercial paper and money market investments throughout 2001. Interest expense was $0.4 million in 2001 and 2000. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2001 was $0.5 million compared to $1.3 million in 2000. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Journal Sentinel production facility in 2001 was $0.1 million compared to $0.9 million in 2000. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 42.0% in 2001 compared to 40.1% in 2000. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction of deferred tax assets for state net operating losses. Discontinued Operations Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2001 was $15.2 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 21.2%, compared to $19.3 million in 2000. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2001 were $3.3 million. The loss from discontinued operations in 2001 was $2.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2000. Applicable income tax benefits in 2001 was $0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity and capital requirements have been to pay dividends that have supported employee ownership and to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Since 2000, we have also required liquidity to purchase units in JESTA from employees and former employees. Historically, we have relied on cash flow from operations and, in 2002, supplemented these cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility, to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements. We believe that current cash balances, which were $8.5 million at December 31, 2002, expected cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate for the foreseeable future to provide our working capital, debt service, capital expenditures and cash dividends. 39 Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities was $86.1 million in 2002 compared to $118.4 million in 2001 and $133.1 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly due to funding of the pension plan obligations of $44.5 million in 2002. Cash used for investing activities was $51.4 million in 2002 compared to $108.1 million in 2001 and $94.0 million in 2000. Capital expenditures for property and equipment were $53.2 million in 2002, $90.2 million in 2001 and $96.8 million in 2000. We continued to invest in the building of our daily newspaper production facility, digital television equipment and upgrades to the telecommunications fiber optic network. Cash used for acquisitions was zero in 2002, $22.1 million in 2001 and $8.0 million in 2000. Cash received from sales of assets was $1.5 million in 2002, $5.2 million in 2001, including $4.4 million from the sale of certain of the assets of the Milwaukee label printing operation, and $3.2 million in 2000. In 2000, we received $7.1 million from the redemption of the preferred stock received from the 1995 sale of Perry Printing, a former subsidiary. Cash used for financing activities was $31.7 million in 2002 compared to $11.9 million in 2001 and $33.0 million in 2000. We increased our borrowing under our credit agreement by $86.4 million in 2002. The increased borrowing was primarily used to purchase units of beneficial interest from employees and former employees and for funding of pension plan obligations. In 2002, purchases of units were $125.3 million compared with $84.4 million in 2001 and $77.1 million in 2000. Sales of units were $38.9 million, $101.8 million and $90.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We paid cash dividends of $31.6 million, $37.9 million and $36.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Cash used for discontinued operations was $3.4 million in 2002 and $3.7 million in 2000. Cash provided by discontinued operations was $0.5 million in 2001. We have a $120.0 million bank revolving credit agreement, expiring May 30, 2003, to support our cash requirements. As of December 31, 2002, we had borrowings of $90.8 million under this credit agreement, including $2.8 million bearing interest at the base rate of 4.25% and $88.0 million bearing interest at the LIBOR based rate of 2.40%, and immediately available credit of $29.2 million. We presently expect to extend this credit agreement for approximately 1 year. Stock Trust As of December 31, 2002, our treasury, our employees, and former employees owned units representing beneficial ownership of 90% of our stock. As of the end of 2002, we believe that employees and former employees had outstanding balances under demand notes secured by pledges of units from various financial institutions totaling approximately $433.1 million. Eligible optionees under the stock trust, including certain categories of designated employees, the Grant family shareholders and us, have the right to purchase units offered for sale. We are not obligated to purchase units, though in recent years prior to the suspension of trading on October 25, 2002, we have elected to do so for the convenience of stock trust unitholders. On October 25, 2002, our board of directors determined to indefinitely suspend our purchase and sale of units and also directed us to explore potential sources for additional permanent capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional permanent capital, or if we do, what the terms or structure will be or the extent to which new capital will be used to purchase units offered for sale. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations are summarized below. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other long term liabilities................. $ 3.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 Operating leases............................ 69.1 15.7 33.3 20.1 Total contractual obligations............... $ 72.8 $ 17.3 $ 34.4 $ 21.1 Other long term liabilities consist primarily of obligations for non compete agreements resulting from acquisitions and deposits received from subleases of building operating leases. We lease office space, certain broadcasting facilities, distribution centers, printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases. Some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses, as well as provisions for the payment of utilities, maintenance and taxes by us. 40 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Other Commitments Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other contractual commitments............... $ 122.4 $ 39.4 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 Standby letters of credit................... 1.2 1.2 Total other commitments..................... $ 123.6 $ 40.6 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 A purchase commitment for newsprint for our publishing businesses, which runs through 2006, from a newsprint supplier as of December 31, 2002, was $104.7 million. The commitment is based on market prices for quantities we determine will meet our newsprint requirements over the term of the contract. In the unlikely event that newsprint is no longer required in our business, our commitment would expire without obligation. Purchase commitments related to capital expenditures for our daily newspapers new production facility were approximately $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002. We expect to spend up to $112.4 million on this project scheduled to be completed in early 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we have spent $102.7 million on this project. In addition, we have the right to broadcast certain television programs during the years 2003 2008 under contracts aggregating $8.3 million. We have $1.2 million of standby letters of credit for business insurance purposes. Critical Accounting Policies Our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, property and equipment, intangible assets, income taxes, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We specifically review historical write off activity by market, large customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (such as bankruptcy filings, credit history, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history, the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment. If our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results, increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required. Property and equipment We assign useful lives for our property and equipment based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate the majority of the property and equipment. A change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a companys assets, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales. Changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles Goodwill, broadcast licenses and other indefinite lived intangible assets account for 32.9% and 34.6% of total assets in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under Statement No. 142 require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value, including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses. Additionally, the 41 fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed. Accordingly, we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under Statement No. 142 to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates, and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase, respectively. Accrued Income Taxes The Internal Revenue Service and various state Departments of Revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns. From time to time, the IRS and the state Departments of Revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged. The final disposition of any positions challenged by the IRS or state Departments of Revenue could require us to make additional tax payments. Nonetheless, we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters. Accrued Litigation We are subject to various legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims. When necessary, we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims. The estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Employee Benefits We are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims. A third party administrator is used to process all claims. Liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience. Liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future. We rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding. We provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations such as: o the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations; o the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations; o the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations; and o the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid postretirement benefits. Moodys Aa Corporate bonds, as of the measurement date, is the benchmark we use to determine the assumed discount rate, which was reduced from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.75% for 2002. We make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits, such as the expected rate of return on plan assets (decreased from 9.5% in 2001 to 8.5% in 2002) and the rate of compensation increase (4.5% in 2002 and 2001). Changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan. We review these assumptions on an annual basis. We also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine post retirement benefit costs other than pension. We provide the actuarial firms with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation. These assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation. The discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation. The medical cost of inflation is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations. New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142. Statement No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. As required by Statement No. 142, we performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7.7 million ($6.5 million after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of earnings. 42 Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of, as well as broadening the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations. Accordingly, the closures of Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A., as discussed in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, have been treated as discontinued operations. In June 2002, Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued. Statement No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies the previous guidance on the subject. It requires, among other things, that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred rather than at the commitment date to the exit or disposal plan. The provisions for Statement No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Statement No. 146 may affect when future costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized. Effect of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation. We have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity, cost containment programs and, where the competitive environment exists, increased selling prices. However, changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs, which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term notes payable to banks and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. However, a 10% change in the interest rate is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings before income taxes. In addition, we have shut down our operations outside the United States and have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. Many of our unitholders have borrowed funds to pay for their purchase of units. Dividends on our common stock passed through to our unitholders have in the past helped our unitholders make required periodic interest payments on those loans. Increases in the interest rates on unitholder loans could result in our unitholders seeking increased dividends from us. Dividends are established by our board of directors in their sole discretion, and we are under no obligation to pay dividends on our common stock. A 10% increase in the interest rate on unitholder loans is not expected to have a material impact on dividends declared by our board of directors. 43

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the 3 years ended December 31, 2002, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. See "Forward Looking Statements" for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Overview Our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. We previously reported 8 business segments, which included our corporate operations and the operations of each one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. In order to better reflect our operations as a diversified media company, and to reflect certain changes in the way our management receives internal financial information, we determined it appropriate under Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," to aggregate previously reported segments and identify new segments by type of business rather than by names of individual operating entities. As a result, we changed our reportable business segments in 2002 to the following: (i) publishing; (ii) broadcasting; (iii) telecommunications; (iv) printing services; and (v) other. Our publishing segment consists of a daily newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and more than 90 community newspapers and shoppers. Our broadcasting segment consists of 36 radio stations and 6 television stations in 11 states. Our telecommunications segment consists of wholesale and business to business telecommunications services provided through a high speed fiber optic telecommunications network that covers more than 4,400 route miles in 7 states. Our printing services segment reflects the operations of our printing and assembly and fulfillment business. Our other segment consists of a label printing business and a direct marketing services business. Also included in other are corporate expenses and eliminations. Acquisition and Sale On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho. The cash purchase price for the stations was approximately $22.1 million. On March 2, 2001, we sold certain assets of the Milwaukee operation of our label printing business. The cash sale price was approximately $4.4 million. Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2002 was $801.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 0.9%, compared to $808.8 million in 2001. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2002 were $447.6 million, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 3.5%, compared to $463.7 million in 2001. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2002 were $239.7 million, a decrease of $21.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to $261.0 million in 2001. 26 The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Revenue 2001 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 311.1 38.8% $ 320.6 39.6% Broadcasting..................................... 152.8 19.1 134.8 16.7 Telecommunications............................... 148.7 18.6 152.0 18.8 Printing services................................ 97.8 12.2 114.6 14.2 Other............................................ 91.0 11.3 86.8 10.7 Total operating revenue..................... 801.4 100.0 808.8 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 447.6 55.9 463.7 57.3 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 239.7 29.9 261.0 32.3 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 687.3 85.8 724.7 89.6 Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 14.2% $ 84.1 10.4% The decrease in total operating revenue was primarily due to the decrease in classified advertising in our publishing businesses, service disconnections and price reductions in our telecommunications business and the consolidation of our U. S. printing services operations and the continued slowdown in our publication printing services business. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Olympic, political and issue advertising in our television broadcasting business. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The decrease in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives. Our consolidated operating earnings in 2002 were $114.1 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 35.6%, compared to $84.1 million in 2001. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Earnings 2001 Earnings (in millions) Publishing....................................... $ 30.3 26.6% $ 24.9 29.6% Broadcasting..................................... 33.4 29.3 15.5 18.4 Telecommunications............................... 41.0 35.9 48.0 57.1 Printing services................................ 2.1 1.8 (0.8) (0.9) Other............................................ 7.3 6.4 (3.5) (4.2) Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 100.0% $ 84.1 100.0% The increase in total operating earnings was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives, workforce reductions and the closure or transition of certain business units, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the adverse impact on third quarter 2001 earnings following the September 11 terrorist attacks offset by the decrease in the profit margin on telecommunication services. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and, accordingly, we ceased amortizing goodwill, broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements. If Statement No. 142 had been adopted effective January 1, 2001, our total operating earnings would have been $92.1 million. 27 Our consolidated EBITDA in 2002 was $160.7 million, an increase of $24.9 million, or 18.3%, compared to $135.8 million in 2001. EBITDA is defined as operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization. We believe the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Our management uses EBITDA, among other things, to evaluate our operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, our lenders use EBITDA to measure our ability to service our debt. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use. The following table presents a reconciliation of our operating earnings to EBITDA by segment for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Depreciation Percent of Depreciation Percent of Operating and Total Operating and Total Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA (in millions) Publishing................. $ 30.3 $ 14.2 $ 44.5 27.7% $ 24.9 $ 13.9 $ 38.8 28.6% Broadcasting............... 33.4 7.3 40.7 25.3 15.5 13.3 28.8 21.2 Telecommunications......... 41.0 17.1 58.1 36.2 48.0 14.7 62.7 46.2 Printing services.......... 2.1 5.2 7.3 4.5 (0.8) 6.2 5.4 4.0 Other...................... 7.3 2.8 10.1 6.3 (3.5) 3.6 0.1 Total...................... $ 114.1 $ 46.6 $160.7 100.0% $ 84.1 $ 51.7 $ 135.8 100.0% The increase in total EBITDA was primarily due to increases in operating earnings in our publishing, broadcasting, printing services and other reportable segments offset by a decrease in our telecommunications segment. Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2002 was $311.1 million, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 3.0%, compared to $320.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from publishing were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. EBITDA from publishing in 2002 was $44.5 million, an increase of $5.7 million, or 14.6%, compared to $38.8 million in 2001 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Operating earnings............. $ 28.7 $ 1.6 $ 30.3 $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 EBITDA......................... $ 38.5 $ 6.0 $ 44.5 $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 28 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 75.5 $ 56.9 $ 132.4 $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 Classified................ 62.4 9.8 72.2 67.9 10.9 78.8 General................... 10.1 10.1 9.7 9.7 Other..................... 15.9 1.5 17.4 14.1 1.4 15.5 Total advertising revenue. 163.9 68.2 232.1 166.3 68.0 234.3 Circulation revenue............ 45.3 3.2 48.5 48.1 3.3 51.4 Other revenue.................. 3.7 26.8 30.5 4.4 30.5 34.9 Total operating revenue........ $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Advertising revenue in 2002 accounted for 74.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.1% in 2001. Retail advertising revenue in 2002 was $132.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to $130.3 million in 2001. The increase is comprised of a $3.0 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints and a $1.2 million increase in community newspaper retail advertising and inserts, in part due to rate increases, offset by a $2.1 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP (run of press) advertisements. We believe the shift toward retail preprints in 2002 was due in part to changes in marketing strategies of certain major national retail advertisers. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2002 was $72.2 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 8.4%, compared to $78.8 million in 2001. At the daily newspaper, decreases in employment advertising of $8.6 million and real estate advertising of $0.1 million were partially offset by increases in automotive advertising of $2.8 million and general advertising of $0.4 million. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 37.5% of total classified advertising in 2002, represented a 27.0% decrease from 2001. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic uncertainty; however, with each quarter in 2002 compared to 2001, the decrease in total classified advertising has reduced. The increase in automotive advertising is primarily attributed to auto manufacturers promoting 0% financing programs. General advertising revenue in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.1%, compared to $9.7 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in general ROP advertising mainly from our telecommunications customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 773.6 812.0 4.7% Classified...................................... 922.4 970.6 5.0% General......................................... 52.7 51.1 + 3.1% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,748.7 1,833.7 4.7% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 773.5 719.5 + 7.5% Total advertising linage in 2002 decreased 4.7% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 5.0% decrease in classified advertising and a 4.7% decrease in retail advertising partially offset by a 3.1% increase in general advertising. The decrease in classified advertising lineage is consistent with the decrease in the classified advertising revenue. Retail advertising linage decreased while preprint advertising pieces rose 7.5% primarily as a result of the shift to preprint advertising from a major national retail customer. 29 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 93,888 94,898 1.1% Shoppers........................................ 105,545 113,846 7.3% Total full pages of advertising...................... 199,433 208,744 4.5% Revenue per page..................................... $ 305.86 $ 288.61 + 6.0% Total pages of full page advertising in 2002 decreased 4.5% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 7.3% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 1.1% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 6.0% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline and event marketing, in 2002 was $17.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.3%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2002 accounted for 15.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 16.0% in 2001. Circulation revenue in 2002 was $48.5 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.6%, compared to $51.4 million in 2001. The decrease was mainly attributed to the 4.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels weekday edition and 3.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels Sunday edition, a 3.5% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers and greater discounts given to new subscribers. In January 2002, we eliminated home delivery of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in all but 12 counties in southeastern Wisconsin. As of the end of 2002, this decision contributed to a decrease in net paid circulation for the daily and Sunday edition of 3.6% and 4.9%, respectively. On June 30, 2002, in an effort to increase readership in certain areas of Milwaukee County, we began offering greater discounts on home delivery and single copy sales. Circulation in those areas has increased since offering the discounts. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing opportunities at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2002 accounted for 9.8% of total publishing revenue compared to 10.9% in 2001. Other revenue in 2002 was $30.5 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 12.6%, compared to $34.9 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers and the loss of 3 commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2002 were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. Contributing to the increase was a $12.3 million reduction in the cost of newsprint and ink compared to 2001 and a $6.8 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. These cost reductions were partially offset by $4.6 million in start up costs in 2002 related to the new production facility. We anticipate that our new production facility will be fully operational in early 2003. We expect that our new presses will provide improved print reproduction quality and increased productivity, as well as additional opportunities to pursue commercial printing revenue from third parties. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has resulted in our daily newspaper using more newsprint and experiencing a temporary increase in single copy circulation. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2002 was $152.7 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 13.3%, compared to $134.8 million in 2001. Operating earnings from broadcasting in 2002 were $33.4 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 116.0%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. EBITDA from broadcasting in 2002 was $40.7 million, an increase of $12.0 million, or 41.8%, compared to $28.7 million in 2001 (see page28 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain of the assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho, for approximately $22.1 million in cash. We began operating the stations on January 1, 2002. 30 The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 78.2 $ 74.5 $ 152.7 $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 Operating earnings............. $ 15.2 $ 18.2 $ 33.4 $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 EBITDA......................... $ 18.2 $ 22.5 $ 40.7 $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2002 was $78.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 5.8%, compared to $73.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $2.9 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.7 million increase from national advertising revenue across most markets, and a $0.7 million increase in political and issue advertising revenue. These increases in advertising revenue from the radio stations reflect a $0.5 million adverse impact in 2001 from advertising cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2002 were $15.2 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 157.6%, compared to $5.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the discontinuation of $5.7 million of goodwill and broadcast license amortization expense, the $4.3 million increase in revenue and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives at all of our radio stations. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2002 was $74.5 million, an increase of $13.6 million, or 22.3%, compared to $60.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $7.8 million increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $4.6 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $1.5 million increase in national advertising revenue. Included in the revenue increase is $5.3 million from the 2 stations in Idaho that were acquired on December 31, 2001. These increases in advertising revenue from the television stations reflect in part the $1.3 million adverse impact in 2001 of the loss of advertising spots during the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2002 were $18.2 million, an increase of $8.6 million, or 89.6%, compared to $9.6 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the $13.6 million increase in revenue, the discontinuation of $1.0 million of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the effects of cost control initiatives at all of our television stations. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has had a negative impact on our broadcast results due to reduced spending levels by some advertisers. There was a hesitancy on the part of some advertisers to place schedules during the period of time leading up to the war, cancellations by some advertisers for the duration of war coverage and elimination of advertising inventory available from our television networks during their continuous coverage of the war. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2002 was $148.7 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 2.2%, compared to $152.0 million in 2001. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2002 were $41.0 million, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 14.7%, compared to $48.0 million in 2001. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2002 was $58.1 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 7.3%, compared to $62.7 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Wholesale telecommunication services provide network transmission solutions for other service providers by offering bulk transmission capacity. Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2002 was $97.3 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 5.2%, compared to $102.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to service disconnections and price reductions. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2002 was $7.5 million compared to $8.1 million at the beginning of 2002 and $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $1.3 million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Commercial telecommunication services provide advanced data communications and long distance service to small and medium sized businesses in the Upper Midwest, principally in Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota and Illinois. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2002 was $51.4 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.0%, compared to $49.4 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in long distance services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial advanced data services at the end of 2002 of $3.0 million was virtually equal to the amount at the beginning of 2002 and $0.2 million higher than the $2.8 31 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.7 million in monthly recurring revenue were offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to service disconnections, the decrease in profit margins on services provided due to price reductions and the increase in depreciation expense of $2.5 million resulting from the completion of several capital investment initiatives during 2001. We expect continued service disconnections and price reductions in our wholesale telecommunications business will cause an increasing downward trend that could result in a significant decrease in our telecommunications operating earnings into 2003. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 20.1% and 22.5% of our telecommunications revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2002 and WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2002. We have a pre bankruptcy receivable, net of applicable "set off" accounts payable, from WorldCom of $0.5 million. We recorded a reserve in the amount of the net receivable in the third quarter of 2002. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. A renewal service contract with Global Crossing is being negotiated, though Global Crossing retains the right to accept or reject our current contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy. Global Crossing is currently expected to exit from bankruptcy in May 2003. WorldCom also has a right to accept or reject our contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy, which is not currently expected to happen before late 2003 or 2004. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. We continue to provide services to WorldCom and Global Crossing and receive timely payment for those services. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2002 was $97.8 million, a decrease of $16.8 million, or 14.6%, compared to $114.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from printing services in 2002 were $2.1 million, an increase of $2.9 million, compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2001. EBITDA from printing services in 2002 was $7.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 35.2%, compared to $5.4 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The decrease in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to the consolidation of our U.S. operations to eliminate customers that did not fit our long term strategic business plans and continued slowdown in the publication printing services business. CD ROM replication continued at essentially the same level as in the prior year; however, we continue to experience intense price competition for this product in all markets. The increase in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to a reduction in operational costs and an increase in the sale of products with higher margins. These were partially offset by the decrease in revenue and a $2.5 million loss on impairment of CD ROM related equipment. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 37.6% and 29.8% of our printing services revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On February 4, 2003, we announced the closure of our CD ROM mastering and replications operations. We do not expect the costs to close these operations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Other Other operating revenue in 2002 was $91.0 million, an increase of $4.2 million, or 4.8%, compared to $86.8 million in 2001. Other operating earnings in 2002 were $7.3 million, an increase of $10.8 million compared to losses of $3.5 million in 2001. Other EBITDA in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $10.0 million, compared to $0.1 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). 32 The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 56.5 $ 38.3 $ (3.8) $ 91.0 $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 Operating earnings........... $ 2.4 $ (0.1) $ 5.0 $ 7.3 $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) EBITDA....................... $ 4.2 $ 0.5 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 The increase in other operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in the gravure label printing operation of new label products for our largest label printing customer, SAB/Miller Brewing Company, and in print and mail services and database marketing services in our direct marketing services business. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services is $21.6 million and $21.3 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the September 11 terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing the amount of direct mail. The increase in other operating earnings was primarily attributed to the decrease in the litigation reserve by $4.1 million to reflect the settlement of the Newspaper Merger Class Action Suit (discussed in Note 8 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the $3.2 million increase in operating revenue from our label printing and direct marketing services businesses, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives and the discontinuation of $0.4 million of goodwill amortization expense partially offset by the $1.3 million loss on impairment of a customer list at our direct marketing services business. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for 50.7% and 47.4% of our label printing business revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, our label printing business was in the second year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2002 were $1.0 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 37.5%, compared to $1.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents offset by interest income received from refunds of state income taxes. Interest expense in 2002 was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million in 2001. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2002 was $1.8 million compared to $0.5 million in 2001. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel production facility in 2002 was $1.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2001. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 43.2% in 2002 compared to 42.0% in 2001. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the litigation that was settled during 2002. Discontinued Operations In January 2002, we announced the closure of the Fox Cities Newspapers, located in Appleton, Wisconsin, which published 6 community newspapers. These community newspapers were part of the publishing reportable segment. On April 29, 2002, the board of directors of our French printing services subsidiary, IPC Communication Services, S.A., a business in our printing services segment, approved a resolution to proceed to close IPC Communication Services, S.A. through a liquidation process. The remaining operations of IPC Communication Services, S.A., were turned over to a liquidator on December 31, 2002. The operations of the Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A. have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, prior periods have been restated to reflect this treatment. Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2002 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 78.3%, compared to $15.2 million in 2001. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2002 were zero and $3.3 million at December 31, 2001. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 was $7.2 million compared to $2.2 million in 2001. Applicable income tax benefits were $6.6 million and $0.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 33 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under Statement No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, including broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements, are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations when their carrying amounts exceed their estimated fair values. We performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7,670 ($6,509 after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statements of earnings. 2001 compared to 2000 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2001 was $808.8 million, a decrease of $10.4 million, or 1.3%, compared to $819.2 million in 2000. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2001 were $463.7 million, an increase of $16.4 million, or 3.7%, compared to $447.3 million in 2000. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2001 were $261.0 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 0.1%, compared to $262.7 million in 2000. The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2001 and 2000: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2001 Revenue 2000 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 320.6 39.6% $ 345.3 42.1% Broadcasting..................................... 134.8 16.7 149.9 18.3 Telecommunications............................... 152.0 18.8 126.6 15.5 Printing services................................ 114.6 14.2 107.3 13.1 Other............................................ 86.8 10.7 90.1 11.0 Total operating revenue..................... 808.8 100.0 819.2 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 463.7 57.3 447.3 54.6 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 261.0 32.3 262.7 32.1 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 724.7 89.6 710.0 86.7 Total operating earnings......................... $ 84.1 10.4% $ 109.2 13.3% The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the decrease in advertising revenue in our publishing business and the decrease in television operating revenue due to the decline in political and issue advertising and the economic downturn offset by the increase in telecommunications operating revenue attributed to new sales opportunities and network expansion. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted television news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The increase in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost of workforce reduction and business transition charges, the increase in the cost of raw materials other than newsprint and the increase in the cost of payroll and benefits. 34 Our operating earnings in 2001 were $84.1 million, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 23.0%, compared to $109.2 million in 2000. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2001 and 2000: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2001 Revenue 2000 Revenue (in millions) Publishing....................................... $ 24.9 29.6% $ 39.3 36.0% Broadcasting..................................... 15.5 18.4 30.4 27.9 Telecommunications............................... 48.0 57.1 40.1 36.7 Printing services................................

Our consolidated EBITDA in 2001 was $135.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 14.8%, compared to $159.3 million in 2000. The following table presents a reconciliation of our operating earnings to EBITDA by segment for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Depreciation Percent of Depreciation Percent of Operating and Total Operating and Total Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA (in millions) Publishing................. $ 24.9 $ 13.9 $ 38.8 28.6% $ 39.3 $ 14.2 $ 53.5 33.6% Broadcasting............... 15.5 13.3 28.8 21.2 30.4 13.6 44.0 27.6 Telecommunications......... 48.0 14.7 62.7 46.2 40.1 11.4 51.5 32.3 Printing services..........

Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2001 was $320.6 million, a decrease of $24.7 million, or 7.2%, compared to $345.3 million in 2000. Operating earnings from publishing were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.4 million, or 36.6%, compared to $39.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from publishing in 2001 was $38.8 million, a decrease of $14.7 million, or 27.5%, compared to $53.5 million in 2000 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Operating earnings............. $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 $ 38.4 $ 0.9 $ 39.3 EBITDA......................... $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 $ 46.5 $ 7.0 $ 53.5 35 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 $ 74.2 $ 56.8 $ 131.0 Classified................ 67.9 10.9 78.8 85.4 12.1 97.5 General................... 9.7 9.7 10.9 10.9 Other..................... 14.1 1.4 15.5 13.3 1.4 14.7 Total advertising revenue. 166.3 68.0 234.3 183.8 70.3 254.1 Circulation revenue............ 48.1 3.3 51.4 48.3 3.5 51.8 Other revenue.................. 4.4 30.5 34.9 4.9 34.5 39.4 Total operating revenue........ $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Advertising revenue in 2001 accounted for 73.1% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.6% in 2000. Retail advertising revenue in 2001 was $130.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.5%, compared to $131.0 million in 2000. The decrease is comprised of a $1.1 million decrease in community newspapers retail advertising and a $0.4 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP advertisements offset by a $0.8 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints. We believe certain major national retail advertisers have changed their marketing strategies and have shifted toward retail preprints. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2001 was $78.8 million, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 19.2%, compared to $97.5 million in 2000. At the daily newspaper, the decrease in employment advertising of $19.4 million was partially offset by increases in real estate advertising, automotive advertising and general advertising. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 47.7% of total classified advertising in 2001, represented a 37.5% decrease from 2000. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic weakness. General advertising revenue in 2001 was $9.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 11.0%, compared to $10.9 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in general ROP and preprint advertising mainly from our airline customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 812.0 811.5 0.1% Classified...................................... 970.6 1,164.3 16.6% General......................................... 51.1 63.6 19.7% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,833.7 2,039.4 10.0% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 719.5 665.7 + 8.1% Total advertising linage in 2001 decreased 10.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 16.6% decrease in classified advertising, an 0.1% decrease in retail advertising and a 19.7% decrease in general advertising. Retail advertising linage decreased primarily as a result of the shift in major retail advertising to more preprint advertising. Preprint advertising pieces rose 8.1% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in preprint advertising from major national retail customers. 36 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 94,898 111,440 14.8% Shoppers........................................ 113,846 134,057 15.1% Total full pages of advertising...................... 208,744 245,497 15.0% Revenue per page..................................... $ 288.61 $ 258.94 + 11.5% Total pages of full page advertising in 2001 decreased 15.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 15.1% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 14.8% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 11.5% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline, event marketing, legal notices and Internet products in 2001 was $15.5 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 5.4%, compared to $14.7 million in 2000. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2001 accounted for 16.0% of total publishing revenue compared to 15.0% in 2000. Circulation revenue in 2001 was $51.4 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.8%, compared to $51.8 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly attributed to a 7.4% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels weekday edition, a 1.6% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels Sunday edition and a 4.7% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2001 accounted for 10.9% of total publishing revenue compared to 11.4% in 2000. Other revenue in 2001 was $34.9 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 11.4%, compared to $39.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2001 were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.3 million, or 36.5%, compared to $39.2 million in 2000. Contributing to the decrease was a $24.7 million decrease in the total publishing operating revenue and $3.3 million in workforce reductions partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in the cost of newsprint and ink and a $8.4 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2001 was $134.8 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 10.1%, compared to $149.9 million in 2000. Operating earnings in 2001 were $15.5 million, a decrease of $14.9 million, or 49.0%, compared to $30.4 million in 2000. EBITDA in 2001 was $28.7 million, a decrease of $15.3 million, or 34.8%, compared to $44.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 $ 73.5 $ 76.4 $ 149.9 Operating earnings............. $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 $ 5.0 $ 25.4 $ 30.4 EBITDA......................... $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 $ 14.4 $ 29.6 $ 44.0 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2001 was $73.9 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%, compared to $73.5 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to a $0.7 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.6 million increase in network and other revenue offset by a $0.6 million decrease in political and issue advertising revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in national advertising revenue. These changes in advertising revenue from the radio stations in 2001 reflect the $0.5 million adverse impact from cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. 37 Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2001 were $5.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 18.0%, compared to $5.0 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the $0.4 million increase in revenue and the $1.0 million decrease in payroll costs and other selling expenses. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2001 was $60.9 million, a decrease of $15.5 million, or 20.3%, compared to $76.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $9.1 million decrease in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $3.6 million decrease in local advertising revenue and a $2.5 million decrease from national advertising revenue across all markets. Of these decreases in advertising revenue from the television stations in 2001, $1.3 million was due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2001 were $9.6 million, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 62.2%, compared to $25.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to the $15.5 million decrease in revenue. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2001 was $152.0 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 20.1%, compared to $126.6 million in 2000. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2001 were $48.0 million, an increase of $7.9 million, or 19.7%, compared to $40.1 million in 2000. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2001 was $62.7 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 21.7%, compared to $51.5 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2001 was $102.6 million, an increase of $18.4 million, or 21.9%, compared to $84.2 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to strong demand for our services and the network expansion into Michigan and Indiana. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2001 was $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $5.5 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $2.9 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2001 was $49.4 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 16.5%, compared to $42.4 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in data services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial data services at the end of 2001 was $3.0 million compared to $2.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $2.4 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.8 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The increase in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to the $25.4 million increase in revenue offset by a decrease in profit margins due to price reductions. We expect continued price reductions and service disconnections will cause a downward trend in earnings in 2002. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 22.5% and 23.7% of our telecommunications operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2001 was $114.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 6.8%, compared to $107.3 million in 2000. The operating loss from printing services in 2001 was $0.8 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, compared to earnings of $3.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from printing services was $5.4 million in 2001, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 46.0%, compared to $10.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The increase in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in assembly services. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily attributed to $2.3 million in expense related to the transition of the Eastern and Western Regions into one operational unit called IPC U.S. Operations and $0.7 million in costs related to the shutdown of operations in Ireland. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 29.8% and 24.4% of our printing services revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 38 Other Other operating revenue in 2001 was $86.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 3.7%, compared to $90.1 million in 2000. Other operating losses in 2001 were $3.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 11.6%, compared to losses of $4.0 million in 2000. Other EBITDA in 2001 was $0.1 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 $ 59.6 $ 34.3 $ (3.8) $ 90.1 Operating earnings........... $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) $ (0.9) $ 0.1 $ (3.2) $ (4.0) EBITDA....................... $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 $ 1.6 $ 1.3 $ (2.6) $ 0.3 The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the March 2001 sale of the Milwaukee label printing business offset by the increase in print and mail services in our direct marketing services business. Operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing their use of direct mail. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services was $21.3 million and $19.7 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001 and 2000, the operating losses were primarily attributed to an increase in the litigation reserve. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for approximately 47.4% and 27.5% of our label printing operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001, our label printing business was in the first year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2001 were $1.6 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 23.1%, compared to $1.3 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the increase in cash available for commercial paper and money market investments throughout 2001. Interest expense was $0.4 million in 2001 and 2000. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2001 was $0.5 million compared to $1.3 million in 2000. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Journal Sentinel production facility in 2001 was $0.1 million compared to $0.9 million in 2000. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 42.0% in 2001 compared to 40.1% in 2000. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction of deferred tax assets for state net operating losses. Discontinued Operations Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2001 was $15.2 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 21.2%, compared to $19.3 million in 2000. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2001 were $3.3 million. The loss from discontinued operations in 2001 was $2.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2000. Applicable income tax benefits in 2001 was $0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity and capital requirements have been to pay dividends that have supported employee ownership and to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Since 2000, we have also required liquidity to purchase units in JESTA from employees and former employees. Historically, we have relied on cash flow from operations and, in 2002, supplemented these cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility, to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements. We believe that current cash balances, which were $8.5 million at December 31, 2002, expected cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate for the foreseeable future to provide our working capital, debt service, capital expenditures and cash dividends. 39 Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities was $86.1 million in 2002 compared to $118.4 million in 2001 and $133.1 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly due to funding of the pension plan obligations of $44.5 million in 2002. Cash used for investing activities was $51.4 million in 2002 compared to $108.1 million in 2001 and $94.0 million in 2000. Capital expenditures for property and equipment were $53.2 million in 2002, $90.2 million in 2001 and $96.8 million in 2000. We continued to invest in the building of our daily newspaper production facility, digital television equipment and upgrades to the telecommunications fiber optic network. Cash used for acquisitions was zero in 2002, $22.1 million in 2001 and $8.0 million in 2000. Cash received from sales of assets was $1.5 million in 2002, $5.2 million in 2001, including $4.4 million from the sale of certain of the assets of the Milwaukee label printing operation, and $3.2 million in 2000. In 2000, we received $7.1 million from the redemption of the preferred stock received from the 1995 sale of Perry Printing, a former subsidiary. Cash used for financing activities was $31.7 million in 2002 compared to $11.9 million in 2001 and $33.0 million in 2000. We increased our borrowing under our credit agreement by $86.4 million in 2002. The increased borrowing was primarily used to purchase units of beneficial interest from employees and former employees and for funding of pension plan obligations. In 2002, purchases of units were $125.3 million compared with $84.4 million in 2001 and $77.1 million in 2000. Sales of units were $38.9 million, $101.8 million and $90.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We paid cash dividends of $31.6 million, $37.9 million and $36.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Cash used for discontinued operations was $3.4 million in 2002 and $3.7 million in 2000. Cash provided by discontinued operations was $0.5 million in 2001. We have a $120.0 million bank revolving credit agreement, expiring May 30, 2003, to support our cash requirements. As of December 31, 2002, we had borrowings of $90.8 million under this credit agreement, including $2.8 million bearing interest at the base rate of 4.25% and $88.0 million bearing interest at the LIBOR based rate of 2.40%, and immediately available credit of $29.2 million. We presently expect to extend this credit agreement for approximately 1 year. Stock Trust As of December 31, 2002, our treasury, our employees, and former employees owned units representing beneficial ownership of 90% of our stock. As of the end of 2002, we believe that employees and former employees had outstanding balances under demand notes secured by pledges of units from various financial institutions totaling approximately $433.1 million. Eligible optionees under the stock trust, including certain categories of designated employees, the Grant family shareholders and us, have the right to purchase units offered for sale. We are not obligated to purchase units, though in recent years prior to the suspension of trading on October 25, 2002, we have elected to do so for the convenience of stock trust unitholders. On October 25, 2002, our board of directors determined to indefinitely suspend our purchase and sale of units and also directed us to explore potential sources for additional permanent capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional permanent capital, or if we do, what the terms or structure will be or the extent to which new capital will be used to purchase units offered for sale. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations are summarized below. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other long term liabilities................. $ 3.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 Operating leases............................ 69.1 15.7 33.3 20.1 Total contractual obligations............... $ 72.8 $ 17.3 $ 34.4 $ 21.1 Other long term liabilities consist primarily of obligations for non compete agreements resulting from acquisitions and deposits received from subleases of building operating leases. We lease office space, certain broadcasting facilities, distribution centers, printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases. Some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses, as well as provisions for the payment of utilities, maintenance and taxes by us. 40 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Other Commitments Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other contractual commitments............... $ 122.4 $ 39.4 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 Standby letters of credit................... 1.2 1.2 Total other commitments..................... $ 123.6 $ 40.6 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 A purchase commitment for newsprint for our publishing businesses, which runs through 2006, from a newsprint supplier as of December 31, 2002, was $104.7 million. The commitment is based on market prices for quantities we determine will meet our newsprint requirements over the term of the contract. In the unlikely event that newsprint is no longer required in our business, our commitment would expire without obligation. Purchase commitments related to capital expenditures for our daily newspapers new production facility were approximately $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002. We expect to spend up to $112.4 million on this project scheduled to be completed in early 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we have spent $102.7 million on this project. In addition, we have the right to broadcast certain television programs during the years 2003 2008 under contracts aggregating $8.3 million. We have $1.2 million of standby letters of credit for business insurance purposes. Critical Accounting Policies Our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, property and equipment, intangible assets, income taxes, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We specifically review historical write off activity by market, large customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (such as bankruptcy filings, credit history, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history, the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment. If our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results, increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required. Property and equipment We assign useful lives for our property and equipment based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate the majority of the property and equipment. A change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a companys assets, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales. Changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles Goodwill, broadcast licenses and other indefinite lived intangible assets account for 32.9% and 34.6% of total assets in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under Statement No. 142 require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value, including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses. Additionally, the 41 fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed. Accordingly, we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under Statement No. 142 to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates, and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase, respectively. Accrued Income Taxes The Internal Revenue Service and various state Departments of Revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns. From time to time, the IRS and the state Departments of Revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged. The final disposition of any positions challenged by the IRS or state Departments of Revenue could require us to make additional tax payments. Nonetheless, we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters. Accrued Litigation We are subject to various legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims. When necessary, we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims. The estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Employee Benefits We are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims. A third party administrator is used to process all claims. Liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience. Liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future. We rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding. We provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations such as: o the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations; o the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations; o the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations; and o the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid postretirement benefits. Moodys Aa Corporate bonds, as of the measurement date, is the benchmark we use to determine the assumed discount rate, which was reduced from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.75% for 2002. We make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits, such as the expected rate of return on plan assets (decreased from 9.5% in 2001 to 8.5% in 2002) and the rate of compensation increase (4.5% in 2002 and 2001). Changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan. We review these assumptions on an annual basis. We also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine post retirement benefit costs other than pension. We provide the actuarial firms with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation. These assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation. The discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation. The medical cost of inflation is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations. New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142. Statement No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. As required by Statement No. 142, we performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7.7 million ($6.5 million after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of earnings. 42 Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of, as well as broadening the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations. Accordingly, the closures of Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A., as discussed in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, have been treated as discontinued operations. In June 2002, Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued. Statement No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies the previous guidance on the subject. It requires, among other things, that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred rather than at the commitment date to the exit or disposal plan. The provisions for Statement No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Statement No. 146 may affect when future costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized. Effect of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation. We have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity, cost containment programs and, where the competitive environment exists, increased selling prices. However, changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs, which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term notes payable to banks and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. However, a 10% change in the interest rate is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings before income taxes. In addition, we have shut down our operations outside the United States and have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. Many of our unitholders have borrowed funds to pay for their purchase of units. Dividends on our common stock passed through to our unitholders have in the past helped our unitholders make required periodic interest payments on those loans. Increases in the interest rates on unitholder loans could result in our unitholders seeking increased dividends from us. Dividends are established by our board of directors in their sole discretion, and we are under no obligation to pay dividends on our common stock. A 10% increase in the interest rate on unitholder loans is not expected to have a material impact on dividends declared by our board of directors. 43
