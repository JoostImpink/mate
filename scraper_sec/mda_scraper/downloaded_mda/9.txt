ITEM 7MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSGeneralThe Company operates in two primary businesses: Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solutions. Building Technologies & Solutions provides facility systems and services including comfort and energy management for the residential and non residential buildings markets, security products and services, and fire detection and suppression products and services. Power Solutions designs and manufactures automotive batteries for the replacement and original equipment markets. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity of the Company for the three year period ended September 30, 2018. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements.FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 Net Sales Year Ended September 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeNet sales$31,400 $30,172 4%The increase in consolidated net sales was due to higher sales in the Building Technologies & Solutions business ($1,004 million), the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($512 million) and higher sales in the Power Solutions business ($467 million), partially offset by lower sales due to business divestitures ($755 million). The increased sales in the Building Technologies & Solutions business, net of divestitures, primarily related to higher volumes across all segments. Increased sales in the Power Solutions business primarily resulted from the impact of higher lead costs on pricing as well as favorable pricing and product mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, impact of lead costs on pricing and business divestitures, consolidated net sales also increased 4% as compared to the prior year. Refer to the segment analysis below within Item 7 for a discussion of net sales by segment.Cost of Sales / Gross Profit Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeCost of sales$22,020 $20,833 6%Gross profit9,380 9,339 %% of sales29.9% 31.0% Cost of sales increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 110 basis points. Gross profit in the Building Technologies & Solutions business increased due to prior year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($68 million), and higher volumes and favorable mix across all segments, partially offset by business divestitures and higher operating costs. Gross profit in the Power Solutions business was impacted by higher operating costs primarily driven by efforts to satisfy customer demand, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. Net mark to market adjustments on 29pension and postretirement plans had a net unfavorable year over year impact on cost of sales of $88 million ($16 million charge in fiscal 2018 compared to a $72 million gain in fiscal 2017) primarily due to a decrease in U.S. investment returns. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on cost of sales of approximately $383 million. Refer to the segment analysis below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization ("EBITA") by segment.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeSelling, general and administrative expenses$6,010 $6,158 2 %% of sales19.1% 20.4% Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") decreased by $148 million year over year, and SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 130 basis points. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to productivity savings and costs synergies, business divestitures and a gain on sale of the Scott Safety business in the Building Technologies & Solutions Global Products segment ($114 million). The net favorable year over year impact on SG&A resulting from transaction and integration costs was $177 million. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on SG&A of $78 million. The net mark to market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans had a net unfavorable year over year impact on SG&A of $322 million ($26 million gain in fiscal 2018 compared to a $348 million gain in fiscal 2017) primarily due to a decrease in U.S. investment returns. Refer to the segment analysis below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment EBITA by segment.Restructuring and Impairment Costs Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeRestructuring and impairment costs$263 $367 28 %Refer to Note 16, "Significant Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Companys restructuring plans.Net Financing Charges Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeNet financing charges$441 $496 11 %Refer to Note 9, "Debt and Financing Arrangements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure related to the Companys net financing charges.Equity Income Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeEquity income$235 $240 2 %The decrease in equity income was primarily due to lower income at partially owned affiliates in the Power Solutions business, partially offset by higher income at partially owned affiliates in the Building Technologies & Solutions business. Refer to the segment analysis below within Item 7 for a discussion of segment EBITA by segment.30Income Tax Provision Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeIncome tax provision$518 $705 27 %Effective tax rate18% 28% The statutory tax rate in Ireland is being used as a comparison since the Company is domiciled in Ireland. The effective rate is above the statutory rate of 12.5% for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the discrete net impacts of U.S. Tax Reform, final income tax effects of the completed divestiture of the Scott Safety business, legal entity restructuring associated with the Power Solutions business, valuation allowance adjustments and tax rate differentials, partially offset by the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives, tax audit closures and tax benefits due to changes in entity tax status. The effective rate is above the statutory rate of 12.5% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Companys investment in certain subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the Scott Safety business, the income tax effects of pension mark to market gains and tax rate differentials, partially offset by the jurisdictional mix of significant restructuring and impairment costs, Tyco Merger transaction and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, tax audit closures, a tax benefit due to changes in entity tax status and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives. The fiscal 2018 effective tax rate decreased as compared to the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate primarily due to discrete tax items and tax planning initiatives. The fiscal year 2018 and 2017 global tax planning initiatives related primarily to foreign tax credit planning, changes in entity tax status, global financing structures and alignment of the Companys global business functions in a tax efficient manner. Refer to Note 18, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.Valuation AllowancesThe Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowances may be necessary.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering feasible tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily within Germany would not be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded $56 million of valuation allowances as income tax expense in the three month period ended September 30, 2018.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily in Canada, China and Mexico would not be able to be realized, and it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Germany would be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded $27 million of net valuation allowances as income tax expense in the three month period ended September 30, 2017.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities.During fiscal 2018, the Company settled tax examinations impacting fiscal years 2010 to fiscal 2012 which resulted in a $25 million net benefit to income tax expense.During fiscal 2017, the Company settled a significant number of tax examinations impacting fiscal years 2006 to fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, income tax audit resolutions resulted in a net $191 million benefit to income tax expense.The Companys federal income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the IRS and respective non U.S. tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, 31management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At September 30, 2018, the Company had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.Other Tax MattersIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $139 million due to changes in entity tax status.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a tax charge of $129 million due to legal entity restructuring associated with the Power Solutions business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Scott Safety business to 3M Company. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $114 million and income tax expense of $30 million. In addition, during fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a discrete non cash tax charge of $490 million related to establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Companys investment in certain subsidiaries of the Scott Safety business. Refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded transaction and integration costs of $234 million and $428 million, respectively. These costs generated tax benefits of $27 million and $69 million, respectively, which reflects the Companys current tax position in these jurisdictions.During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred significant charges for restructuring and impairment costs of $263 million and $367 million, respectively. Refer to Note 16, "Significant Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. These costs generated tax benefits of $38 million and $63 million, respectively, which reflects the Companys current tax position in these jurisdictions. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded pension mark to market gains of $10 million and $420 million, respectively. These gains generated tax expense (benefit) of $(3) million and $126 million, respectively, which reflects the Companys current tax position in these jurisdictions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a tax charge of $53 million due to a change in the deferred tax liability related to the outside basis of certain nonconsolidated subsidiaries.In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $101 million due to changes in entity tax status.Impacts of Tax Legislation and Change in Statutory Tax RatesOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) was enacted and significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, imposing a one time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non U.S. subsidiaries, and implementing a territorial tax system and various base erosion minimum tax provisions.In connection with the Companys analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax charge of $108 million during fiscal 2018. This provisional net tax charge arises from a benefit of $108 million due to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by the Companys tax charge relating to the one time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings, inclusive of all relevant taxes, of $216 million. The Companys estimated benefit of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities increased from $101 million as of December 31, 2017 to $108 million as of September 30, 2018 due to calculation refinement of the Companys estimated impact. The Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The Companys tax charge for transition tax decreased from $305 million as of December 31, 2017 to $216 million as of September 30, 2018 due to further analysis of the Companys post 1986 non U.S. earnings and profits (E&P) previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and refinement of the estimated impact of tax law changes.Based on the effective dates of certain aspects of the U.S. tax law changes, various applicable impacts of the enacted legislation could not be finalized as of September 30, 2018. While the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax, the final impact of the U.S. tax law changes may differ from these estimated impacts, due to, future treasury regulations, tax 32law technical corrections, notices, rulings, refined computations, and other items. The Company will finalize such provisional amounts within the time period prescribed by Staff Accounting Bulletin 118.During the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017, other tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions. These law changes did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Loss From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax$ $(34) ** Measure not meaningfulRefer to Note 4, "Discontinued Operations," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeIncome from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests$221 $199 11%Income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 ** Measure not meaningfulThe increase in income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to higher net income related to the Johnson Controls Hitachi joint venture in the Building Technologies & Solutions business and higher net income at a Power Solutions partially owned affiliate. Refer to Note 4, "Discontinued Operations," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Companys discontinued operations. Net Income Attributable to Johnson Controls Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeNet income attributable to Johnson Controls$2,162 $1,611 34%The increase in net income attributable to Johnson Controls was primarily due to lower income tax provision due to higher discrete period net tax charges in the prior year, lower SG&A, lower restructuring and impairment costs, lower net financing charges and higher gross profit. Fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share attributable to Johnson Controls was $2.32 compared to $1.71 in fiscal 2017.33Comprehensive Income Attributable to Johnson Controls Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 ChangeComprehensive income attributable to Johnson Controls$1,689 $1,710 1 %The decrease in comprehensive income attributable to Johnson Controls was due to a decrease in other comprehensive income attributable to Johnson Controls ($572 million) resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by higher net income attributable to Johnson Controls ($551 million). These year over year unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments were primarily driven by the weakening of the British pound and euro currencies against the U.S. dollar. SEGMENT ANALYSISManagement evaluates the performance of its business units based primarily on segment EBITA, which is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, significant restructuring and impairment costs, and net mark to market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans.Building Technologies & Solutions Net Salesfor the Year EndedSeptember 30, Segment EBITAfor the Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeBuilding Solutions North America$8,679 $8,341 4% $1,109 $1,039 7%Building Solutions EMEA/LA3,696 3,595 3% 344 290 19%Building Solutions Asia Pacific2,553 2,444 4% 347 323 7%Global Products8,472 8,455 % 1,338 1,179 13% $23,400 $22,835 2% $3,138 $2,831 11% Net Sales:The increase in Building Solutions North America was due to higher volumes ($343 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($20 million), partially offset by the impact of prior year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($25 million).

The U.S. federal statutory rate is being used as a comparison for fiscal 2016 since the Company was a U.S. domiciled company for 11 months of fiscal 2016. The effective rate is above the statutory rate of 12.5% for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Companys investment in certain subsidiaries related to the divestiture of the Scott Safety business, the income tax effects of pension mark to market gains and tax rate differentials, partially offset by the jurisdictional mix of significant restructuring and impairment costs, Tyco Merger transaction and integration costs, purchase accounting adjustments, tax audit closures, a tax benefit due to changes in entity tax status and the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives. The effective rate is below the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for fiscal 2016 primarily due to the benefits of continuing global tax planning initiatives and foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by the jurisdictional mix of restructuring and impairment costs, and the tax impacts of the Merger and integration related costs. The fiscal 2017 effective tax rate increased as compared to the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate primarily due to the tax effects of transactions ($408 million), and the tax effects of restructuring and impairment costs ($37 million), partially offset by the tax effects of reserve and valuation allowance adjustments ($164 million) and tax planning initiatives. The fiscal year 2017 and 2016 global tax planning initiatives related primarily to foreign tax credit planning, changes in entity tax status, global financing structures and alignment of the Companys global business functions in a tax efficient manner. Refer to Note 18, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details.Valuation AllowancesThe Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowances may be necessary.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, the Company determined 37that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily in Canada, China and Mexico would not be able to be realized, and it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in Germany would be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded $27 million of net valuation allowances as income tax expense in the three month period ended September 30, 2017.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company performed an analysis related to the realizability of its worldwide deferred tax assets. As a result, and after considering tax planning initiatives and other positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that no other material changes were needed to its valuation allowances. Therefore, there was no impact to income tax expense due to valuation allowance changes in the three month period or year ended September 30, 2016.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities.During fiscal 2017, the Company settled a significant number of tax examinations impacting fiscal years 2006 to fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, income tax audit resolutions resulted in a net $191 million benefit to income tax expense.The Companys federal income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the IRS and respective non U.S. tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At September 30, 2017, the Company had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year.Other Tax MattersDuring fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $428 million of transaction and integration costs which generated a $69 million tax benefit.During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a discrete non cash tax charge of $490 million related to establishment of a deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference of the Companys investment in certain subsidiaries of the Scott Safety business. This business is reported as net assets held for sale given the announced sale to 3M Company. Refer to Note 3, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," and Note 4, "Discontinued Operations," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a tax charge of $53 million due to a change in the deferred tax liability related to the outside basis of certain nonconsolidated subsidiaries.In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $101 million due to changes in entity tax status.During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred significant charges for restructuring and impairment costs. Refer to Note 16, "Significant Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. These costs generated tax benefits of $63 million and $76 million, respectively, which reflects the Companys current tax position in these jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company completed its merger with Tyco. As a result of that transaction, the Company incurred incremental tax expense of $137 million. In preparation for the spin off of the Automotive Experience business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company incurred incremental tax expense for continuing operations of $26 million in fiscal 2016.Impacts of Tax Legislation and Change in Statutory Tax RatesOn October 13, 2016, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS released final and temporary Section 385 regulations. These regulations address whether certain instruments between related parties are treated as debt or equity.The "look through rule," under subpart F of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, expired for the Company on September 30, 2015. The "look through rule" had provided an exception to the U.S. taxation of certain income generated by foreign subsidiaries. The 38rule was extended in December 2015 retroactive to the beginning of the Companys 2016 fiscal year. The retroactive extension was signed into legislation and was made permanent through the Companys 2020 fiscal year.During the fiscal years ended 2017 and 2016, other tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions. These law changes did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

These year over year favorable foreign currency translation adjustments were primarily driven by the strengthening of the euro and British pound currencies against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen currency against the U.S. dollar. Segment AnalysisManagement evaluates the performance of its business units based primarily on segment EBITA, which is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, significant restructuring and impairment costs, and net mark to market adjustments on pension and postretirement plans.Building Technologies & Solutions Net Salesfor the Year EndedSeptember 30, Segment EBITAfor the Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeBuilding Solutions North America$8,341 $4,687 78% $1,039 $494 *Building Solutions EMEA/LA3,595 1,613 * 290 74 *Building Solutions Asia Pacific2,444 1,736 41% 323 222 45%Global Products8,455 6,148 38% 1,179 637 85% $22,835 $14,184 61% $2,831 $1,427 98% * Measure not meaningfulNet Sales:The increase in Building Solutions North America was due to incremental sales related to the Tyco Merger including current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($3,689 million), the impact of prior year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($15 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by a prior year business divestiture ($32 million) and lower installation volumes ($23 million).The increase in Building Solutions EMEA/LA was due to incremental sales related to the Tyco Merger including current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($1,982 million), higher volumes ($7 million), the impact of prior year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($5 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($3 million), partially offset by a business divestiture ($15 million).The increase in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was due to incremental sales related to the Tyco Merger including current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($653 million), higher volumes of equipment and control systems ($41 million), and higher service volumes ($38 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($24 million). The increase in volume was driven by favorable local economic conditions.The increase in Global Products was due to incremental sales related to the Tyco Merger including current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($2,157 million), higher volumes ($221 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($20 million), partially offset by lower volumes related to business divestitures and deconsolidation ($91 million). The increase in volumes was primarily attributable to new product offerings. Segment EBITA:The increase in Building Solutions North America was due to incremental income related to the Tyco Merger ($567 million), the net impact of prior year and current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($52 million), favorable mix ($9 million), lower SG&A ($3 million) as a result of productivity and synergy savings net of a prior year gain on business divestiture, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million) and prior year transaction costs ($1 million), partially offset by current year integration costs ($42 million), higher operating costs as a result of channel investments ($25 million), current year transaction costs ($13 million), lower volumes ($6 million) and a prior year business divestiture ($2 million).40The increase in Building Solutions EMEA/LA was due to incremental income related to the Tyco Merger ($221 million), the net impact of prior year and current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($33 million), lower SG&A as a result of productivity and synergy savings ($23 million), favorable mix ($7 million), higher volumes ($2 million) and prior year transaction costs ($1 million), partially offset by a current year unfavorable arbitration award ($50 million), current year integration costs ($6 million), lower equity income ($6 million), current year transaction costs ($5 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($3 million) and a prior year business divestiture ($1 million).The increase in Building Solutions Asia Pacific was due to incremental income related to the Tyco Merger ($73 million), lower SG&A as a result of productivity savings ($24 million), higher volumes ($20 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by unfavorable mix ($6 million), current year integration costs ($5 million), higher operating costs ($4 million) and current year transaction costs ($2 million).The increase in Global Products was due to incremental income related to the Tyco Merger ($474 million), higher volumes ($55 million), lower SG&A as a result of productivity and synergy savings ($41 million), higher equity income ($33 million), prior year integration costs ($20 million), prior year transaction costs ($14 million) and lower operating costs ($13 million), partially offset by the net impact of prior year and current year nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments ($42 million), current year integration costs ($25 million), unfavorable mix ($16 million), current year transaction costs ($13 million), the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($5 million), a prior year gain on acquisition of partially owned affiliate ($4 million) and business divestitures ($3 million).Power Solutions Year EndedSeptember 30, (in millions)2017 2016 ChangeNet sales$7,337 $6,653 10%Segment EBITA1,427 1,327 8%Net sales increased due to the impact of higher lead costs on pricing ($427 million) favorable pricing and product mix ($154 million), higher sales volumes ($86 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($17 million). The increase in volumes was driven by start stop battery volumes and growth in China. Additionally, higher start stop volumes contributed to favorable product mix. Segment EBITA increased due to favorable pricing and product mix net of lead cost increases ($106 million), lower SG&A as a result of productivity savings ($39 million), higher equity income ($28 million), higher volumes ($27 million), prior year restructuring and impairment costs included in equity income ($7 million), prior year transaction costs ($1 million) and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation ($1 million), partially offset by higher operating costs primarily driven by efforts to satisfy growing customer demand ($108 million) and current year transaction costs ($1 million). GOODWILL, LONG LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTSGoodwill at September 30, 2018 was $19.5 billion, $0.2 billion lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation.Goodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The Company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be the Companys reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances, using a fair value method based on managements judgments and assumptions or third party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, the Company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the Companys average of historical and future financial results. In certain instances, the Company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement." The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. The Company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.41The assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment, and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations. The primary assumptions used in the impairment tests were managements projections of future cash flows. Although the Companys cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses, there are significant judgments in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to a reporting unit.Indefinite lived other intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests.While the Company believes the judgments and assumptions used in the impairment tests are reasonable and no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived assets existed during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and, therefore, impairment charges could be required, which could be material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company reviews long lived assets, including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360 10 15, "Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," ASC 350 30, "General Intangibles Other than Goodwill" and ASC 985 20, "Costs of software to be sold, leased, or marketed." ASC 360 10 15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. ASC 350 30 requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities to be considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived, they shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess. ASC 985 20 requires the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product be compared to the net realizable value of that product. The amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset shall be written off. In fiscal 2018, the Company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its long lived assets in conjunction with its restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2018. As a result, the Company reviewed the long lived assets for impairment and recorded $42 million of asset impairment charges within restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. Of the total impairment charges, $31 million related to the Global Products segment, $6 million related to the Power Solutions segment and $5 million related to Corporate assets. Refer to Note 16, "Significant Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. The impairments were measured under a market approach utilizing an appraisal to determine fair values of the impaired assets. This method is consistent with the methods the Company employed in prior periods to value other long lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement."In fiscal 2017, the Company concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its long lived assets in conjunction with its restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2017. As a result, the Company reviewed the long lived assets for impairment and recorded $77 million of asset impairment charges within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income. Of the total impairment charges, $30 million related to the Building Solutions North America segment, $20 million related to the Global Products segment, $19 million related to Corporate assets, $7 million related to the Power Solutions segment and $1 million related to the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment. Refer to Note 16, "Significant Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. The impairments were measured, depending on the asset, under either an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing an appraisal to determine fair values of the impaired assets. These methods are consistent with the methods the Company employed in prior periods to value other long lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement."In fiscal 2016, the Company concluded it had triggering events requiring assessment of impairment for certain of its long lived assets in conjunction with its restructuring actions announced in fiscal 2016. As a result, the Company reviewed the long lived assets for impairment and recorded $103 million of asset impairment charges within restructuring and impairment costs on the consolidated statements of income. Of the total impairment charges, $64 million related to the Power Solutions segment, $24 million related to Corporate assets, $8 million related to the Global Products segment, $4 million related to the Building Solutions Asia Pacific segment and $3 million related to the Building Solutions EMEA/LA segment. In addition, the Company recorded $87 million of asset impairments within discontinued operations related to Adient in fiscal 2016. Refer to Note 16, "Significant 42Restructuring and Impairment Costs," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. The impairments were measured, depending on the asset, under either an income approach utilizing forecasted discounted cash flows or a market approach utilizing an appraisal to determine fair values of the impaired assets. These methods are consistent with the methods the Company employed in prior periods to value other long lived assets. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement."Investments in partially owned affiliates ("affiliates") at September 30, 2018 were $1.3 billion, $0.1 billion higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to equity income from partially owned affiliates in the Power Solutions business and the Johnson Controls Hitachi joint venture.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWorking Capital September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017 (in millions) ChangeCurrent assets$11,823 $12,292 Current liabilities(11,250) (11,854) 573 438 31% Less: Cash(200) (321) Add: Short term debt1,315 1,214 Add: Current portion of long term debt26 394 Less: Assets held for sale (189) Add: Liabilities held for sale 72 Working capital (as defined)$1,714 $1,608 7% Accounts receivable$7,065 $6,666 6%Inventories3,224 3,209 %Accounts payable4,644 4,271 9%The Company defines working capital as current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash, short term debt, the current portion of long term debt, and the current portions of assets and liabilities held for sale. Management believes that this measure of working capital, which excludes financing related items and businesses to be divested, provides a more useful measurement of the Companys operating performance.The increase in working capital at September 30, 2018 as compared to September 30, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to organic sales growth, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing and mix of supplier payments. The Companys days sales in accounts receivable at September 30, 2018 were 66, a slight increase from 65 at September 30, 2017. There has been no significant adverse change in the level of overdue receivables or changes in revenue recognition methods. The Companys inventory turns for the year ended September 30, 2018 were slightly higher than the comparable period ended September 30, 2017 primarily due to changes in inventory production levels.Days in accounts payable at September 30, 2018 were 73 days, higher than 70 days at the comparable period ended September 30, 2017.43Cash Flows Year Ended September 30,(in millions)2018 2017Cash provided by operating activities$2,513 $31Cash provided (used) by investing activities1,215 (1,137)Cash provided (used) by financing activities(3,752) 698Capital expenditures(1,030) (1,343)The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable movements in working capital balances, higher prior year income tax payments related to the Adient spin off ($1.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017), and prior year operating cash outflows in the Automotive Experience business before the Adient spin off, change in control pension payments and transaction/integration related payments. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net cash proceeds received from the Scott Safety business divestiture in the current year and a decrease in capital expenditures.The increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher current year repayments of long term debt. The decrease in capital expenditures in the current year is primarily related to lower capital investments in the current year in the Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solution businesses, and prior year capital investments in the Automotive Experience business before the Adient spin off.Capitalization September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017 (in millions) ChangeShort term debt$1,315 $1,214 Current portion of long term debt26 394 Long term debt9,654 11,964 Total debt$10,995 $13,572 19 %Less: cash and cash equivalents200 321 Total net debt$10,795 $13,251 19 % Shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders21,164 20,447 4 %Total capitalization$31,959 $33,698 5 % Total net debt as a % of total capitalization33.8% 39.3% Net debt and net debt as a percentage of total capitalization are non GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the percentage of total net debt to total capitalization is useful to understanding the Companys financial condition as it provides a review of the extent to which the Company relies on external debt financing for its funding and is a measure of risk to its shareholders.The Company believes its capital resources and liquidity position at September 30, 2018 are adequate to meet projected needs. The Company believes requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, minimum pension contributions, debt maturities and any potential acquisitions in fiscal 2019 will continue to be funded from operations, supplemented by short and long term borrowings, if required. The Company currently manages its short term debt position in the U.S. and euro commercial paper markets and bank loan markets. In the event the Company and Tyco International Holding S.a.r.L.s ("TSarl") are unable to issue commercial paper, they would have the ability to draw on their $2.0 billion and $1.25 billion revolving credit facilities, respectively. Both facilities mature in August 2020. There were no draws on the revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017. The Company also selectively makes use of short term credit lines other than its revolving credit facilities at the Company and TSarl. The Company estimates that, as of September 30, 2018, it could borrow up to $2.0 billion based on average borrowing levels during the fourth 44quarter of fiscal 2018 on committed credit lines. As such, the Company believes it has sufficient financial resources to fund operations and meet its obligations for the foreseeable future.The Companys debt financial covenant in its revolving credit facility requires a minimum consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls of at least $3.5 billion at all times. The revolving credit facility also limits the amount of debt secured by liens that may be incurred to a maximum aggregated amount of 10% of consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls for liens and pledges. For purposes of calculating these covenants, consolidated shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls is calculated without giving effect to (i) the application of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 715 60, "Defined Benefit Plans Other Postretirement," or (ii) the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. TSarls revolving credit facility contains customary terms and conditions, and a financial covenant that limits the ratio of TSarls debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items set forth in the agreement to 3.5x. TSarls revolving credit facility also limits its ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on its and its subsidiaries property. As of September 30, 2018, the Company and TSarl were in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in their credit agreements and the indentures, governing their notes, and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. None of the Companys or TSarls debt agreements limit access to stated borrowing levels or require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in the respective borrowers credit rating.The Company earns a significant amount of its income outside of the parent company. Outside basis differences in these subsidiaries are deemed to be permanently reinvested except in limited circumstances including a limited accrual related to fiscal 2018 U.S. Tax Reform. In fiscal 2018, due to U.S. Tax Reform, the Company provided income tax related to the change in the Companys assertion over the outside basis difference of certain non U.S. subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. Tax Reform, the U.S. has enacted a tax system that provides an exemption for dividends received by U.S. corporations from 10% or more owned non U.S. corporations. However, certain non U.S, U.S. state and withholding taxes may still apply when closing an outside basis difference via distribution or other transactions. In addition, in fiscal 2017, the Company provided income tax expense related to a change in the Companys assertion over the outside basis difference of the Scott Safety business as a result of the pending divestiture as well as the outside basis of certain nonconsolidated subsidiaries. Also, in fiscal 2016, the Company provided income tax expense related to a change in the Companys assertion over a portion of the permanently reinvested earnings as a result of the planned spin off of the Adient business. The Company currently does not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate undistributed earnings included in the outside basis differences other than in tax efficient manners. Except as noted, the Companys intent is to reduce basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. The Company expects existing U.S. cash and liquidity to continue to be sufficient to fund the Companys U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., should the Company require more capital than is generated by its operations, the Company could elect to raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. The Company has borrowed funds in the U.S. and continues to have the ability to borrow funds in the U.S. at reasonable interest rates. In addition, the Company expects existing non U.S. cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund the Companys non U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should the Company require more capital at the Luxembourg and Ireland holding and financing entities, other than amounts that can be provided in tax efficient methods, the Company could also elect to raise capital through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of the Companys earnings. To better align its resources with its growth strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations in certain underlying markets, the Company committed to a significant restructuring plan in fiscal 2018 and recorded $263 million of restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The restructuring action related to cost reduction initiatives in the Companys Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solutions businesses and at Corporate. The costs consist primarily of workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments. The Company currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring action, the fiscal 2018 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs by approximately $300 million, which is primarily the result of lower cost of sales and SG&A due to reduced employee related costs, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company expects the annual benefit of these actions will be substantially realized in 2020. For fiscal 2018, the savings, net of execution costs, were approximately 25% of the expected annual operating cost reduction. The restructuring action is expected to be substantially complete in 2020. The restructuring plan reserve balance of $174 million at September 30, 2018 is expected to be paid in cash.To better align its resources with its growth strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations in certain underlying markets, the Company committed to a significant restructuring plan in fiscal 2017 and recorded $367 million of restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The restructuring action related to cost 45reduction initiatives in the Companys Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solutions businesses and at Corporate. The costs consist primarily of workforce reductions, plant closures and asset impairments. The Company currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring action, the fiscal 2017 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs from continuing operations by approximately $280 million, which is primarily the result of lower cost of sales and SG&A expenses due to reduced employee related costs, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company expects the annual benefit of these actions will be substantially realized in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018, the savings, net of execution costs, were approximately 85% of the expected annual operating cost reduction. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2019. The restructuring plan reserve balance of $80 million at September 30, 2018 is expected to be paid in cash.To better align its resources with its growth strategies and reduce the cost structure of its global operations to address the softness in certain underlying markets, the Company committed to a significant restructuring plan in fiscal 2016 and recorded $288 million of restructuring and impairment costs in the consolidated statements of income. The restructuring action related to cost reduction initiatives in the Companys Building Technologies & Solutions and Power Solutions businesses and at Corporate. The costs consist primarily of workforce reductions, plant closures, asset impairments and change in control payments. The Company currently estimates that upon completion of the restructuring action, the fiscal 2016 restructuring plan will reduce annual operating costs from continuing operations by approximately $135 million, which is primarily the result of lower cost of sales and SG&A due to reduced employee related costs, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company expects the annual benefit of these actions will be substantially realized in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018, the savings, net of execution costs, were approximately 75% of the expected annual operating cost reduction. The restructuring actions are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2019. The restructuring plan reserve balance of $73 million at September 30, 2018 is expected to be paid in cash.A summary of the Companys significant contractual obligations for continuing operations as of September 30, 2018 is as follows (in millions): Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024and BeyondContractual Obligations Long term debt(including capital lease obligations)*$9,724 $26 $2,489 $1,973 $5,236Interest on long term debt(including capital lease obligations)*5,399 317 560 476 4,046Operating leases1,200 348 492 263 97Purchase obligations2,506 1,490 731 262 23Pension and postretirement contributions476 100 75 76 225Tax indemnification liabilities**255 Total contractual cash obligations$19,560 $2,281 $4,347 $3,050 $9,627* Refer to Note 9, "Debt and Financing Arrangements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the Companys long term debt. ** As a result of the Tyco Merger in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recorded as part of the acquired liabilities of Tyco $290 million of post sale contingent tax indemnification liabilities which is generally recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. The liabilities are recorded at fair value and relate to certain tax related matters borne by the buyer of previously divested subsidiaries of Tyco which Tyco has indemnified certain parties and the amounts are probable of being paid. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded liabilities of $255 million and $290 million, respectively. Of the $255 million recorded as of September 30, 2018, $235 million is related to prior divested businesses and the remainder relates to Tycos tax sharing agreements from its 2007 and 2012 spin off transactions. The payments due by period are not presented due to uncertainty as to when these liabilities will be settled or paid. These are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Medtronic, TE Connectivity, ADT and Pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 separation and tax sharing agreements. 46CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Revenue RecognitionThe Building Technologies & Solutions business recognizes revenue from certain long term contracts over the contractual period under the percentage of completion ("POC") method of accounting. This method of accounting recognizes sales and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded primarily in accounts receivable. Likewise, contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded primarily in deferred revenue. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed monthly. Sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catch up method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recorded when identified. Claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement. The use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. The periodic reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to the Companys results of operations. The Company continually evaluates all of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the POC method of accounting. The Building Technologies & Solutions business enters into extended warranties and long term service and maintenance agreements with certain customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective contract term. The Building Technologies & Solutions business also sells certain heating, ventilating and air conditioning ("HVAC") and refrigeration products and services in bundled arrangements, where multiple products and or services are involved. Significant deliverables within these arrangements include equipment, commissioning, service labor and extended warranties. Approximately four to twelve months separate the timing of the first deliverable until the last piece of equipment is delivered, and there may be extended warranty arrangements with duration of one to five years commencing upon the end of the standard warranty period. In addition, the Buildings business sells security monitoring systems that may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. In accordance with ASU No. 2009 13, "Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force," the Company divides bundled arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price method. In order to estimate relative selling price, market data and transfer price studies are utilized. Revenue recognized for security monitoring equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non contingent up front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services. For transactions in which the Company retains ownership of the subscriber system asset, fees for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term. Non refundable fees received in connection with the initiation of a monitoring contract, along with associated direct and incremental selling costs, are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship.In all other cases, the Company recognizes revenue at the time title passes to the customer or as services are performed.47Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible AssetsGoodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The Company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units, which have been determined to be the Companys reportable segments or one level below the reportable segments in certain instances, using a fair value method based on managements judgments and assumptions or third party valuations. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In estimating the fair value, the Company uses multiples of earnings based on the average of published multiples of earnings of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics and applies to the Companys average of historical and future financial results. In certain instances, the Company uses discounted cash flow analyses or estimated sales price to further support the fair value estimates. The inputs utilized in the analyses are classified as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement." The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. The Company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from September 30 to July 31. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the Companys long term planning and forecasting process. The change in the annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The Company has determined this change in accounting principle is preferable and does not result in adjustments to the Companys financial statements when applied retrospectively. Refer to Note 7, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the goodwill impairment testing performed in the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.Indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to at least annual impairment testing. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trademarks and tradenames and are tested for impairment using a relief from royalty method. A considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests. Impairment of Long Lived AssetsThe Company reviews long lived assets, including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360 10 15, "Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," ASC 350 30, "General Intangibles Other than Goodwill" and ASC 985 20, "Costs of software to be sold, leased, or marketed." ASC 360 10 15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. ASC 350 30 requires intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used in research and development activities be considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the period that those assets are considered indefinite lived, they shall not be amortized but shall be tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an entity shall recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess. ASC 985 20 requires the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product be compared to the net realizable value of that product. The amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed the net realizable value of that asset shall be written off. Refer to Note 17, "Impairment of Long Lived Assets," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment testing performed in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.Employee Benefit PlansThe Company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions and postretirement benefits. Plan assets and obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a significant remeasurement event, based on the Companys measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates as of that date. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.The Company utilizes a mark to market approach for recognizing pension and postretirement benefit expenses, including measuring the market related value of plan assets at fair value and recognizing actuarial gains and losses in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a remeasurement event. Refer to Note 15, "Retirement Plans," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans.48U.S. GAAP requires that companies recognize in the statement of financial position a liability for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are underfunded or unfunded, or an asset for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans that are overfunded. U.S. GAAP also requires that companies measure the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets that determine a benefit plans funded status as of the date of the employers fiscal year end.The Company considers the expected benefit payments on a plan by plan basis when setting assumed discount rates. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the plan jurisdiction, the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For the U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company uses a discount rate provided by an independent third party calculated based on an appropriate mix of high quality bonds. For the non U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company consistently uses the relevant country specific benchmark indices for determining the various discount rates. The Companys weighted average discount rate on U.S. pension plans was 4.10% and 3.80% at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Companys weighted average discount rate on postretirement plans was 3.80% and 3.70% at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Companys weighted average discount rate on non U.S. pension plans was 2.45% and 2.40% at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns on plan assets, adjusted for forward looking considerations, inflation assumptions and the impact of the active management of the plans invested assets. Reflecting the relatively long term nature of the plans obligations, approximately 35% of the plans assets are invested in equity securities and 56% in fixed income securities, with the remainder primarily invested in alternative investments. For the years ending September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Companys expected long term return on U.S. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost was 7.50%. The actual rate of return on U.S. pension plans was below 7.50% in fiscal year 2018 and above 7.50% in fiscal year 2017. For the years ending September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Companys weighted average expected long term return on non U.S. pension plan assets was 5.35% and 4.60%, respectively. The actual rate of return on non U.S. pension plans was below 5.35% in fiscal year 2018 and above 4.60% in fiscal year 2017. For the years ending September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Companys weighted average expected long term return on postretirement plan assets was 5.65% and 5.60%, respectively. The actual rate of return on postretirement plan assets was below 5.65% in fiscal year 2018 and above 5.60% in fiscal year 2017.Beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company believes the long term rate of return will approximate 7.10%, 5.20% and 5.65% for U.S. pension, non U.S. pension and postretirement plans, respectively. Any differences between actual investment results and the expected long term asset returns will be reflected in net periodic benefit costs in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a significant remeasurement event. If the Companys actual returns on plan assets are less than the Companys expectations, additional contributions may be required.In fiscal 2018, total employer contributions to the defined benefit pension plans were $53 million, of which $18 million were voluntary contributions made by the Company. The Company expects to contribute approximately $85 million in cash to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, total employer contributions to the postretirement plans were $4 million. The Company expects to contribute approximately $15 million in cash to its postretirement plans in fiscal 2019.Based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Loss ContingenciesAccruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, environmental matters, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 22, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.The Company records liabilities for its workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities. The determination of these liabilities and related expenses is dependent on claims experience. For most of these liabilities, claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated by utilizing actuarial valuations based upon historical claims experience. The Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. The Company maintains captive insurance companies to manage its insurable liabilities. 49Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance ReceivablesThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. The Companys estimate of the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs is based on the Companys historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed and is discounted to present value from 2068 (which is the Companys reasonable best estimate of the actuarially determined time period through which asbestos related claims will be filed against Company affiliates). Asbestos related defense costs are included in the asbestos liability. The Companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made through 2068. Annually, the Company assesses the sufficiency of its estimated liability for pending and future claims and defense costs by evaluating actual experience regarding claims filed, settled and dismissed, and amounts paid in settlements. In addition to claims and settlement experience, the Company considers additional quantitative and qualitative factors such as changes in legislation, the legal environment, and the Companys defense strategy. The Company also evaluates the recoverability of its insurance receivable on an annual basis. The Company evaluates all of these factors and determines whether a change in the estimate of its liability for pending and future claims and defense costs or insurance receivable is warranted.In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, the Company records asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The Companys estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to the Company for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to its estimated liability for pending and future claims discounted to present value. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, the Company considers available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Refer to Note 22, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities.Product WarrantiesThe Company offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that the Company replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale. The Company records an estimate of future warranty related costs based on actual historical return rates and other known factors. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, the Companys warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. At September 30, 2018, the Company had recorded $392 million of warranty reserves for continuing operations, including extended warranties for which deferred revenue is recorded. The Company monitors its warranty activity and adjusts its reserve estimates when it is probable that future warranty costs will be different than those estimates. Refer to Note 21, "Guarantees," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the Companys product warranty liabilities.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents non U.S. operating and other loss carryforwards for which realization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. On a quarterly basis, the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year.The Company reviews the realizability of its deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset are considered, along with any other positive or negative evidence. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowances may be necessary. At September 30, 2018, the Company had a valuation allowance of $5.2 billion for continuing operations, of which $4.5 billion relates to net operating loss carryforwards primarily in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom for which sustainable taxable income has not been demonstrated; and $700 million for other deferred tax assets.50The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. At September 30, 2018, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $2.4 billion.The Company does not generally provide additional U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on outside basis differences of consolidated subsidiaries included in shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls International plc, except in limited circumstances including anticipated taxation on planned divestitures. The reduction of the outside basis differences via the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries and or distributions could create taxable income. The Companys intent is to reduce the outside basis differences only when it would be tax efficient. Refer to "Capitalization" within the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for discussion of U.S. and non U.S. cash projections.Refer to Note 18, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Companys income tax disclosures.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to the "New Accounting Pronouncements" section within Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements. RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company selectively uses derivative instruments to reduce market risk associated with changes in foreign currency, commodities, interest rates and stock based compensation. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures, which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes. At the inception of the hedge, the Company assesses the effectiveness of the hedge instrument and designates the hedge instrument as either (1) a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or of a recognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to an unrecognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or (3) a hedge of a net investment in a non U.S. operation (a net investment hedge). The Company performs hedge effectiveness testing on an ongoing basis depending on the type of hedging instrument used. All other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging," are revalued in the consolidated statements of income.For all foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, retrospective effectiveness is tested on a monthly basis using a cumulative dollar offset test. The fair value of the hedged exposures and the fair value of the hedge instruments are revalued, and the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge instruments to the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in the value of the hedge is calculated. The hedge is deemed as highly effective if the ratio is between 80% and 125%. For commodity derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges, effectiveness is tested using a regression calculation. Ineffectiveness is minimal as the Company aligns most of the critical terms of its derivatives with the supply contracts.For net investment hedges, the Company assesses its net investment positions in the non U.S. operations and compares it with the outstanding net investment hedges on a quarterly basis. The hedge is deemed effective if the aggregate outstanding principal of the hedge instruments designated as the net investment hedge in a non U.S. operation does not exceed the Companys net investment positions in the respective non U.S. operation.The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market risk associated with changes in interest rates for its fixed rate bonds. At September 30, 2018, the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps. The Company assesses retrospective and prospective effectiveness and records any measured ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of income on a monthly basis.Equity swaps and any other derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 require no assessment of effectiveness.A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements, and further disclosure relating to derivatives and hedging activities is included in Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.51Foreign ExchangeThe Company has manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and enters into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to maintain strict control and achieve the benefits of the Companys global diversification, foreign exchange exposures for each currency are netted internally so that only its net foreign exchange exposures are, as appropriate, hedged with financial instruments.The Company hedges 70% to 90% of the nominal amount of each of its known foreign exchange transactional exposures. The Company primarily enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables. Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. The Company also selectively hedges anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815.The Company has entered into foreign currency denominated debt obligations to selectively hedge portions of its net investment in non U.S. subsidiaries. The currency effects of debt obligations are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") account within shareholders equity attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders where they offset gains and losses recorded on the Companys net investments globally. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company estimates that an unfavorable 10% change in the exchange rates would have decreased net unrealized gains by approximately $212 million and $330 million, respectively.Interest RatesFrom time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to offset its exposure to interest rate movements. In accordance with ASC 815, these outstanding swaps qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. The Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 10% increase in the average cost of the Companys variable rate debt would have resulted in an unfavorable change in pre tax interest expense of approximately $5 million and $13 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.CommoditiesThe Company uses commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market in cases where commodity price risk cannot be naturally offset or hedged through supply base fixed price contracts. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. As a cash flow hedge, gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on purchases of the underlying commodities that will be used in the business. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities.ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER MATTERSThe Companys global operations are governed by environmental laws and worker safety laws. Under various circumstances, these laws impose civil and criminal penalties and fines, as well as injunctive and remedial relief, for noncompliance and require remediation at sites where Company related substances have been released into the environment.The Company has expended substantial resources globally, both financial and managerial, to comply with applicable environmental laws and worker safety laws and to protect the environment and workers. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance. However, the Company has been, and in the future may become, the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or the remediation of Company related substances released into the environment. Such matters typically are resolved with regulatory authorities through commitments to compliance, abatement or remediation programs and in some cases payment of penalties. Historically, neither such commitments nor penalties imposed on the Company have been material.Refer to Note 22, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.52QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA(in millions, except per share data)(quarterly amounts unaudited)FirstQuarter SecondQuarter ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter FullYear 2018 Net sales$7,435 $7,475 $8,120 $8,370 $31,400Gross profit2,169 2,220 2,472 2,519 9,380Net income (1)271 483 804 825 2,383Net income attributable to Johnson Controls230 438 723 771 2,162Earnings per share (2) Basic 0.25 0.47 0.78 0.83 2.34Diluted 0.25 0.47 0.78 0.83 2.32 2017 Net sales$7,086 $7,267 $7,683 $8,136 $30,172Gross profit2,114 2,281 2,431 2,513 9,339Net income (loss) (3)378 (115) 629 927 1,819Net income (loss) attributable to Johnson Controls329 (148) 555 875 1,611Earnings (loss) per share (2) Basic0.35 (0.16) 0.59 0.94 1.72Diluted0.35 (0.16) 0.59 0.93 1.71 (1)The fiscal 2018 first quarter net income includes a $114 million gain on sale of Scott Safety, $158 million of significant restructuring and impairment costs, and $50 million of transaction and integration costs.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements for the 3 years ended December 31, 2002, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements. See "Forward Looking Statements" for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Overview Our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. We previously reported 8 business segments, which included our corporate operations and the operations of each one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. In order to better reflect our operations as a diversified media company, and to reflect certain changes in the way our management receives internal financial information, we determined it appropriate under Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," to aggregate previously reported segments and identify new segments by type of business rather than by names of individual operating entities. As a result, we changed our reportable business segments in 2002 to the following: (i) publishing; (ii) broadcasting; (iii) telecommunications; (iv) printing services; and (v) other. Our publishing segment consists of a daily newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and more than 90 community newspapers and shoppers. Our broadcasting segment consists of 36 radio stations and 6 television stations in 11 states. Our telecommunications segment consists of wholesale and business to business telecommunications services provided through a high speed fiber optic telecommunications network that covers more than 4,400 route miles in 7 states. Our printing services segment reflects the operations of our printing and assembly and fulfillment business. Our other segment consists of a label printing business and a direct marketing services business. Also included in other are corporate expenses and eliminations. Acquisition and Sale On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho. The cash purchase price for the stations was approximately $22.1 million. On March 2, 2001, we sold certain assets of the Milwaukee operation of our label printing business. The cash sale price was approximately $4.4 million. Results of Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2002 was $801.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 0.9%, compared to $808.8 million in 2001. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2002 were $447.6 million, a decrease of $16.1 million, or 3.5%, compared to $463.7 million in 2001. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2002 were $239.7 million, a decrease of $21.3 million, or 8.2%, compared to $261.0 million in 2001. 26 The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Revenue 2001 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 311.1 38.8% $ 320.6 39.6% Broadcasting..................................... 152.8 19.1 134.8 16.7 Telecommunications............................... 148.7 18.6 152.0 18.8 Printing services................................ 97.8 12.2 114.6 14.2 Other............................................ 91.0 11.3 86.8 10.7 Total operating revenue..................... 801.4 100.0 808.8 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 447.6 55.9 463.7 57.3 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 239.7 29.9 261.0 32.3 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 687.3 85.8 724.7 89.6 Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 14.2% $ 84.1 10.4% The decrease in total operating revenue was primarily due to the decrease in classified advertising in our publishing businesses, service disconnections and price reductions in our telecommunications business and the consolidation of our U. S. printing services operations and the continued slowdown in our publication printing services business. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Olympic, political and issue advertising in our television broadcasting business. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The decrease in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives. Our consolidated operating earnings in 2002 were $114.1 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 35.6%, compared to $84.1 million in 2001. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2002 and 2001: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2002 Earnings 2001 Earnings (in millions) Publishing....................................... $ 30.3 26.6% $ 24.9 29.6% Broadcasting..................................... 33.4 29.3 15.5 18.4 Telecommunications............................... 41.0 35.9 48.0 57.1 Printing services................................ 2.1 1.8 (0.8) (0.9) Other............................................ 7.3 6.4 (3.5) (4.2) Total operating earnings......................... $ 114.1 100.0% $ 84.1 100.0% The increase in total operating earnings was primarily due to the decrease in the total cost of newsprint, the increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives, workforce reductions and the closure or transition of certain business units, the discontinuation of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the adverse impact on third quarter 2001 earnings following the September 11 terrorist attacks offset by the decrease in the profit margin on telecommunication services. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and, accordingly, we ceased amortizing goodwill, broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements. If Statement No. 142 had been adopted effective January 1, 2001, our total operating earnings would have been $92.1 million. 27 Our consolidated EBITDA in 2002 was $160.7 million, an increase of $24.9 million, or 18.3%, compared to $135.8 million in 2001. EBITDA is defined as operating earnings plus depreciation and amortization. We believe the presentation of EBITDA is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Our management uses EBITDA, among other things, to evaluate our operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, our lenders use EBITDA to measure our ability to service our debt. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use. The following table presents a reconciliation of our operating earnings to EBITDA by segment for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Depreciation Percent of Depreciation Percent of Operating and Total Operating and Total Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA Earnings Amortization EBITDA EBITDA (in millions) Publishing................. $ 30.3 $ 14.2 $ 44.5 27.7% $ 24.9 $ 13.9 $ 38.8 28.6% Broadcasting............... 33.4 7.3 40.7 25.3 15.5 13.3 28.8 21.2 Telecommunications......... 41.0 17.1 58.1 36.2 48.0 14.7 62.7 46.2 Printing services.......... 2.1 5.2 7.3 4.5 (0.8) 6.2 5.4 4.0 Other...................... 7.3 2.8 10.1 6.3 (3.5) 3.6 0.1 Total...................... $ 114.1 $ 46.6 $160.7 100.0% $ 84.1 $ 51.7 $ 135.8 100.0% The increase in total EBITDA was primarily due to increases in operating earnings in our publishing, broadcasting, printing services and other reportable segments offset by a decrease in our telecommunications segment. Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2002 was $311.1 million, a decrease of $9.5 million, or 3.0%, compared to $320.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from publishing were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. EBITDA from publishing in 2002 was $44.5 million, an increase of $5.7 million, or 14.6%, compared to $38.8 million in 2001 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Operating earnings............. $ 28.7 $ 1.6 $ 30.3 $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 EBITDA......................... $ 38.5 $ 6.0 $ 44.5 $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 28 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 75.5 $ 56.9 $ 132.4 $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 Classified................ 62.4 9.8 72.2 67.9 10.9 78.8 General................... 10.1 10.1 9.7 9.7 Other..................... 15.9 1.5 17.4 14.1 1.4 15.5 Total advertising revenue. 163.9 68.2 232.1 166.3 68.0 234.3 Circulation revenue............ 45.3 3.2 48.5 48.1 3.3 51.4 Other revenue.................. 3.7 26.8 30.5 4.4 30.5 34.9 Total operating revenue........ $ 212.9 $ 98.2 $ 311.1 $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 Advertising revenue in 2002 accounted for 74.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.1% in 2001. Retail advertising revenue in 2002 was $132.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to $130.3 million in 2001. The increase is comprised of a $3.0 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints and a $1.2 million increase in community newspaper retail advertising and inserts, in part due to rate increases, offset by a $2.1 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP (run of press) advertisements. We believe the shift toward retail preprints in 2002 was due in part to changes in marketing strategies of certain major national retail advertisers. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2002 was $72.2 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 8.4%, compared to $78.8 million in 2001. At the daily newspaper, decreases in employment advertising of $8.6 million and real estate advertising of $0.1 million were partially offset by increases in automotive advertising of $2.8 million and general advertising of $0.4 million. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 37.5% of total classified advertising in 2002, represented a 27.0% decrease from 2001. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic uncertainty; however, with each quarter in 2002 compared to 2001, the decrease in total classified advertising has reduced. The increase in automotive advertising is primarily attributed to auto manufacturers promoting 0% financing programs. General advertising revenue in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.1%, compared to $9.7 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in general ROP advertising mainly from our telecommunications customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 773.6 812.0 4.7% Classified...................................... 922.4 970.6 5.0% General......................................... 52.7 51.1 + 3.1% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,748.7 1,833.7 4.7% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 773.5 719.5 + 7.5% Total advertising linage in 2002 decreased 4.7% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 5.0% decrease in classified advertising and a 4.7% decrease in retail advertising partially offset by a 3.1% increase in general advertising. The decrease in classified advertising lineage is consistent with the decrease in the classified advertising revenue. Retail advertising linage decreased while preprint advertising pieces rose 7.5% primarily as a result of the shift to preprint advertising from a major national retail customer. 29 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 93,888 94,898 1.1% Shoppers........................................ 105,545 113,846 7.3% Total full pages of advertising...................... 199,433 208,744 4.5% Revenue per page..................................... $ 305.86 $ 288.61 + 6.0% Total pages of full page advertising in 2002 decreased 4.5% compared to 2001. The decrease was largely due to a 7.3% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 1.1% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 6.0% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline and event marketing, in 2002 was $17.4 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 12.3%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2002 accounted for 15.6% of total publishing revenue compared to 16.0% in 2001. Circulation revenue in 2002 was $48.5 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.6%, compared to $51.4 million in 2001. The decrease was mainly attributed to the 4.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels weekday edition and 3.1% decrease in average net paid circulation for Milwaukee Journal Sentinels Sunday edition, a 3.5% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers and greater discounts given to new subscribers. In January 2002, we eliminated home delivery of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in all but 12 counties in southeastern Wisconsin. As of the end of 2002, this decision contributed to a decrease in net paid circulation for the daily and Sunday edition of 3.6% and 4.9%, respectively. On June 30, 2002, in an effort to increase readership in certain areas of Milwaukee County, we began offering greater discounts on home delivery and single copy sales. Circulation in those areas has increased since offering the discounts. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing opportunities at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2002 accounted for 9.8% of total publishing revenue compared to 10.9% in 2001. Other revenue in 2002 was $30.5 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 12.6%, compared to $34.9 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers and the loss of 3 commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2002 were $30.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 21.8%, compared to $24.9 million in 2001. Contributing to the increase was a $12.3 million reduction in the cost of newsprint and ink compared to 2001 and a $6.8 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. These cost reductions were partially offset by $4.6 million in start up costs in 2002 related to the new production facility. We anticipate that our new production facility will be fully operational in early 2003. We expect that our new presses will provide improved print reproduction quality and increased productivity, as well as additional opportunities to pursue commercial printing revenue from third parties. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has resulted in our daily newspaper using more newsprint and experiencing a temporary increase in single copy circulation. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2002 was $152.7 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 13.3%, compared to $134.8 million in 2001. Operating earnings from broadcasting in 2002 were $33.4 million, an increase of $17.9 million, or 116.0%, compared to $15.5 million in 2001. EBITDA from broadcasting in 2002 was $40.7 million, an increase of $12.0 million, or 41.8%, compared to $28.7 million in 2001 (see page28 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). On December 31, 2001, we acquired the business and certain of the assets of a television station, KIVI TV, in Boise, Idaho and a low power television station, KSAW LP, in Twin Falls, Idaho, for approximately $22.1 million in cash. We began operating the stations on January 1, 2002. 30 The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 78.2 $ 74.5 $ 152.7 $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 Operating earnings............. $ 15.2 $ 18.2 $ 33.4 $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 EBITDA......................... $ 18.2 $ 22.5 $ 40.7 $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2002 was $78.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 5.8%, compared to $73.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $2.9 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.7 million increase from national advertising revenue across most markets, and a $0.7 million increase in political and issue advertising revenue. These increases in advertising revenue from the radio stations reflect a $0.5 million adverse impact in 2001 from advertising cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2002 were $15.2 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 157.6%, compared to $5.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the discontinuation of $5.7 million of goodwill and broadcast license amortization expense, the $4.3 million increase in revenue and the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from cost control initiatives at all of our radio stations. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2002 was $74.5 million, an increase of $13.6 million, or 22.3%, compared to $60.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to a $7.8 million increase in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $4.6 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $1.5 million increase in national advertising revenue. Included in the revenue increase is $5.3 million from the 2 stations in Idaho that were acquired on December 31, 2001. These increases in advertising revenue from the television stations reflect in part the $1.3 million adverse impact in 2001 of the loss of advertising spots during the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2002 were $18.2 million, an increase of $8.6 million, or 89.6%, compared to $9.6 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to the $13.6 million increase in revenue, the discontinuation of $1.0 million of goodwill, broadcast license and network affiliation agreement amortization expense and the effects of cost control initiatives at all of our television stations. The pending outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in March 2003 and the war itself has had a negative impact on our broadcast results due to reduced spending levels by some advertisers. There was a hesitancy on the part of some advertisers to place schedules during the period of time leading up to the war, cancellations by some advertisers for the duration of war coverage and elimination of advertising inventory available from our television networks during their continuous coverage of the war. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2002 was $148.7 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 2.2%, compared to $152.0 million in 2001. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2002 were $41.0 million, a decrease of $7.0 million, or 14.7%, compared to $48.0 million in 2001. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2002 was $58.1 million, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 7.3%, compared to $62.7 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Wholesale telecommunication services provide network transmission solutions for other service providers by offering bulk transmission capacity. Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2002 was $97.3 million, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 5.2%, compared to $102.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to service disconnections and price reductions. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2002 was $7.5 million compared to $8.1 million at the beginning of 2002 and $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $1.3 million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Commercial telecommunication services provide advanced data communications and long distance service to small and medium sized businesses in the Upper Midwest, principally in Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota and Illinois. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2002 was $51.4 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 4.0%, compared to $49.4 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in long distance services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial advanced data services at the end of 2002 of $3.0 million was virtually equal to the amount at the beginning of 2002 and $0.2 million higher than the $2.8 31 million at the beginning of 2001. During 2002, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.7 million in monthly recurring revenue were offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to service disconnections, the decrease in profit margins on services provided due to price reductions and the increase in depreciation expense of $2.5 million resulting from the completion of several capital investment initiatives during 2001. We expect continued service disconnections and price reductions in our wholesale telecommunications business will cause an increasing downward trend that could result in a significant decrease in our telecommunications operating earnings into 2003. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 20.1% and 22.5% of our telecommunications revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Global Crossing filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2002 and WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2002. We have a pre bankruptcy receivable, net of applicable "set off" accounts payable, from WorldCom of $0.5 million. We recorded a reserve in the amount of the net receivable in the third quarter of 2002. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. A renewal service contract with Global Crossing is being negotiated, though Global Crossing retains the right to accept or reject our current contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy. Global Crossing is currently expected to exit from bankruptcy in May 2003. WorldCom also has a right to accept or reject our contract with them as part of its exit from bankruptcy, which is not currently expected to happen before late 2003 or 2004. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. We continue to provide services to WorldCom and Global Crossing and receive timely payment for those services. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2002 was $97.8 million, a decrease of $16.8 million, or 14.6%, compared to $114.6 million in 2001. Operating earnings from printing services in 2002 were $2.1 million, an increase of $2.9 million, compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2001. EBITDA from printing services in 2002 was $7.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 35.2%, compared to $5.4 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The decrease in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to the consolidation of our U.S. operations to eliminate customers that did not fit our long term strategic business plans and continued slowdown in the publication printing services business. CD ROM replication continued at essentially the same level as in the prior year; however, we continue to experience intense price competition for this product in all markets. The increase in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to a reduction in operational costs and an increase in the sale of products with higher margins. These were partially offset by the decrease in revenue and a $2.5 million loss on impairment of CD ROM related equipment. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 37.6% and 29.8% of our printing services revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On February 4, 2003, we announced the closure of our CD ROM mastering and replications operations. We do not expect the costs to close these operations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Other Other operating revenue in 2002 was $91.0 million, an increase of $4.2 million, or 4.8%, compared to $86.8 million in 2001. Other operating earnings in 2002 were $7.3 million, an increase of $10.8 million compared to losses of $3.5 million in 2001. Other EBITDA in 2002 was $10.1 million, an increase of $10.0 million, compared to $0.1 million in 2001 (see page 28 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). 32 The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 56.5 $ 38.3 $ (3.8) $ 91.0 $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 Operating earnings........... $ 2.4 $ (0.1) $ 5.0 $ 7.3 $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) EBITDA....................... $ 4.2 $ 0.5 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 The increase in other operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in the gravure label printing operation of new label products for our largest label printing customer, SAB/Miller Brewing Company, and in print and mail services and database marketing services in our direct marketing services business. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services is $21.6 million and $21.3 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the September 11 terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing the amount of direct mail. The increase in other operating earnings was primarily attributed to the decrease in the litigation reserve by $4.1 million to reflect the settlement of the Newspaper Merger Class Action Suit (discussed in Note 8 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the $3.2 million increase in operating revenue from our label printing and direct marketing services businesses, the decrease in operating costs and expenses resulting from our cost control initiatives and the discontinuation of $0.4 million of goodwill amortization expense partially offset by the $1.3 million loss on impairment of a customer list at our direct marketing services business. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for 50.7% and 47.4% of our label printing business revenue in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, our label printing business was in the second year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2002 were $1.0 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 37.5%, compared to $1.6 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributed to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents offset by interest income received from refunds of state income taxes. Interest expense in 2002 was $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million in 2001. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2002 was $1.8 million compared to $0.5 million in 2001. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel production facility in 2002 was $1.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2001. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 43.2% in 2002 compared to 42.0% in 2001. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the litigation that was settled during 2002. Discontinued Operations In January 2002, we announced the closure of the Fox Cities Newspapers, located in Appleton, Wisconsin, which published 6 community newspapers. These community newspapers were part of the publishing reportable segment. On April 29, 2002, the board of directors of our French printing services subsidiary, IPC Communication Services, S.A., a business in our printing services segment, approved a resolution to proceed to close IPC Communication Services, S.A. through a liquidation process. The remaining operations of IPC Communication Services, S.A., were turned over to a liquidator on December 31, 2002. The operations of the Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A. have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, prior periods have been restated to reflect this treatment. Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2002 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 78.3%, compared to $15.2 million in 2001. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2002 were zero and $3.3 million at December 31, 2001. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 was $7.2 million compared to $2.2 million in 2001. Applicable income tax benefits were $6.6 million and $0.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. 33 Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under Statement No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives, including broadcast licenses and network affiliation agreements, are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations when their carrying amounts exceed their estimated fair values. We performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7,670 ($6,509 after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statements of earnings. 2001 compared to 2000 Consolidated Our consolidated operating revenue in 2001 was $808.8 million, a decrease of $10.4 million, or 1.3%, compared to $819.2 million in 2000. Our consolidated operating costs and expenses in 2001 were $463.7 million, an increase of $16.4 million, or 3.7%, compared to $447.3 million in 2000. Our consolidated selling and administrative expenses in 2001 were $261.0 million, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 0.1%, compared to $262.7 million in 2000. The following table presents our total operating revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total operating revenue for 2001 and 2000: Percent of Percent of Total Total Operating Operating 2001 Revenue 2000 Revenue (in millions) Operating revenue: Publishing....................................... $ 320.6 39.6% $ 345.3 42.1% Broadcasting..................................... 134.8 16.7 149.9 18.3 Telecommunications............................... 152.0 18.8 126.6 15.5 Printing services................................ 114.6 14.2 107.3 13.1 Other............................................ 86.8 10.7 90.1 11.0 Total operating revenue..................... 808.8 100.0 819.2 100.0 Total operating costs and expenses............... 463.7 57.3 447.3 54.6 Selling and administrative expenses.............. 261.0 32.3 262.7 32.1 Total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses................... 724.7 89.6 710.0 86.7 Total operating earnings......................... $ 84.1 10.4% $ 109.2 13.3% The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the decrease in advertising revenue in our publishing business and the decrease in television operating revenue due to the decline in political and issue advertising and the economic downturn offset by the increase in telecommunications operating revenue attributed to new sales opportunities and network expansion. In addition, operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by $1.8 million from preempted advertising due to the uninterrupted television news coverage and certain advertising cancellations on television and radio stations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The increase in total operating costs and expenses and selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost of workforce reduction and business transition charges, the increase in the cost of raw materials other than newsprint and the increase in the cost of payroll and benefits. 34 Our operating earnings in 2001 were $84.1 million, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 23.0%, compared to $109.2 million in 2000.

Our consolidated EBITDA in 2001 was $135.8 million, a decrease of $23.5 million, or 14.8%, compared to $159.3 million in 2000.

Publishing Operating revenue from publishing in 2001 was $320.6 million, a decrease of $24.7 million, or 7.2%, compared to $345.3 million in 2000. Operating earnings from publishing were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.4 million, or 36.6%, compared to $39.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from publishing in 2001 was $38.8 million, a decrease of $14.7 million, or 27.5%, compared to $53.5 million in 2000 (see table above for a reconciliation of publishing operating earnings to publishing EBITDA). The following table presents our publishing operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by daily newspaper and community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Operating earnings............. $ 23.3 $ 1.6 $ 24.9 $ 38.4 $ 0.9 $ 39.3 EBITDA......................... $ 31.7 $ 7.1 $ 38.8 $ 46.5 $ 7.0 $ 53.5 35 The following table presents our publishing operating revenue by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Community Community Daily Newspapers Daily Newspapers Newspaper & Shoppers Total Newspaper & Shoppers Total (in millions) Advertising revenue: Retail.................... $ 74.6 $ 55.7 $ 130.3 $ 74.2 $ 56.8 $ 131.0 Classified................ 67.9 10.9 78.8 85.4 12.1 97.5 General................... 9.7 9.7 10.9 10.9 Other..................... 14.1 1.4 15.5 13.3 1.4 14.7 Total advertising revenue. 166.3 68.0 234.3 183.8 70.3 254.1 Circulation revenue............ 48.1 3.3 51.4 48.3 3.5 51.8 Other revenue.................. 4.4 30.5 34.9 4.9 34.5 39.4 Total operating revenue........ $ 218.8 $ 101.8 $ 320.6 $ 237.0 $ 108.3 $ 345.3 Advertising revenue in 2001 accounted for 73.1% of total publishing revenue compared to 73.6% in 2000. Retail advertising revenue in 2001 was $130.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.5%, compared to $131.0 million in 2000. The decrease is comprised of a $1.1 million decrease in community newspapers retail advertising and a $0.4 million decrease in daily newspaper retail ROP advertisements offset by a $0.8 million increase in daily newspaper retail preprints. We believe certain major national retail advertisers have changed their marketing strategies and have shifted toward retail preprints. Additionally, in 2001, many advertisers reduced or eliminated their newspaper advertisements following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Classified advertising revenue in 2001 was $78.8 million, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 19.2%, compared to $97.5 million in 2000. At the daily newspaper, the decrease in employment advertising of $19.4 million was partially offset by increases in real estate advertising, automotive advertising and general advertising. The decrease in employment advertising, which accounted for almost 47.7% of total classified advertising in 2001, represented a 37.5% decrease from 2000. We believe the decrease in employment advertising resulted primarily from continuing economic weakness. General advertising revenue in 2001 was $9.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 11.0%, compared to $10.9 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in general ROP and preprint advertising mainly from our airline customers. The following table presents the advertising linage of our daily newspaper by category for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change (inches in thousands) Advertising linage (in inches): Retail.......................................... 812.0 811.5 0.1% Classified...................................... 970.6 1,164.3 16.6% General......................................... 51.1 63.6 19.7% Total advertising linage (in inches)................. 1,833.7 2,039.4 10.0% Preprint pieces (in millions)........................ 719.5 665.7 + 8.1% Total advertising linage in 2001 decreased 10.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 16.6% decrease in classified advertising, an 0.1% decrease in retail advertising and a 19.7% decrease in general advertising. Retail advertising linage decreased primarily as a result of the shift in major retail advertising to more preprint advertising. Preprint advertising pieces rose 8.1% in 2001 primarily due to an increase in preprint advertising from major national retail customers. 36 The following table presents the full pages of advertising and revenue per page of our community newspapers and shoppers for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Change Full pages of advertising: Community newspapers............................ 94,898 111,440 14.8% Shoppers........................................ 113,846 134,057 15.1% Total full pages of advertising...................... 208,744 245,497 15.0% Revenue per page..................................... $ 288.61 $ 258.94 + 11.5% Total pages of full page advertising in 2001 decreased 15.0% compared to 2000. The decrease was largely due to a 15.1% decrease in advertising in the shoppers and a 14.8% decrease in advertising in the community newspapers. Revenue per page increased 11.5% due to rate increases. Other advertising revenue, consisting of revenue from direct marketing efforts, JSOnline, event marketing, legal notices and Internet products in 2001 was $15.5 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 5.4%, compared to $14.7 million in 2000. The increase was largely due to increased direct mail advertising and online classified advertising. Circulation revenue in 2001 accounted for 16.0% of total publishing revenue compared to 15.0% in 2000. Circulation revenue in 2001 was $51.4 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.8%, compared to $51.8 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly attributed to a 7.4% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels weekday edition, a 1.6% decrease in average net paid circulation for Journal Sentinels Sunday edition and a 4.7% decrease in paid circulation for our community newspapers. Other revenue, which consists primarily of revenue from commercial printing at the print plants for our community newspapers and shoppers, in 2001 accounted for 10.9% of total publishing revenue compared to 11.4% in 2000. Other revenue in 2001 was $34.9 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 11.4%, compared to $39.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to reduced press runs and page counts from existing commercial printing customers. Publishing operating earnings in 2001 were $24.9 million, a decrease of $14.3 million, or 36.5%, compared to $39.2 million in 2000. Contributing to the decrease was a $24.7 million decrease in the total publishing operating revenue and $3.3 million in workforce reductions partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in the cost of newsprint and ink and a $8.4 million decrease in direct wages and selling and administrative expenses, which resulted primarily from workforce reductions at the daily newspaper. Broadcasting Operating revenue from broadcasting in 2001 was $134.8 million, a decrease of $15.1 million, or 10.1%, compared to $149.9 million in 2000. Operating earnings in 2001 were $15.5 million, a decrease of $14.9 million, or 49.0%, compared to $30.4 million in 2000. EBITDA in 2001 was $28.7 million, a decrease of $15.3 million, or 34.8%, compared to $44.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of broadcasting operating earnings to broadcasting EBITDA). The following table presents our broadcasting operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by radio stations and television stations for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Radio Television Total Radio Television Total (in millions) Operating revenue.............. $ 73.9 $ 60.9 $ 134.8 $ 73.5 $ 76.4 $ 149.9 Operating earnings............. $ 5.9 $ 9.6 $ 15.5 $ 5.0 $ 25.4 $ 30.4 EBITDA......................... $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 28.7 $ 14.4 $ 29.6 $ 44.0 Operating revenue from our radio stations in 2001 was $73.9 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%, compared to $73.5 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to a $0.7 million increase in local advertising revenue and a $0.6 million increase in network and other revenue offset by a $0.6 million decrease in political and issue advertising revenue and a $0.4 million decrease in national advertising revenue. These changes in advertising revenue from the radio stations in 2001 reflect the $0.5 million adverse impact from cancellations and the loss of advertising spots following the September 11 terrorist attacks. 37 Operating earnings from our radio stations in 2001 were $5.9 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 18.0%, compared to $5.0 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the $0.4 million increase in revenue and the $1.0 million decrease in payroll costs and other selling expenses. Operating revenue from our television stations in 2001 was $60.9 million, a decrease of $15.5 million, or 20.3%, compared to $76.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to a $9.1 million decrease in Olympic, political and issue advertising revenue, a $3.6 million decrease in local advertising revenue and a $2.5 million decrease from national advertising revenue across all markets. Of these decreases in advertising revenue from the television stations in 2001, $1.3 million was due to the uninterrupted news coverage and certain advertising cancellations following the September 11 terrorist attacks. Operating earnings from our television stations in 2001 were $9.6 million, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 62.2%, compared to $25.4 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily attributed to the $15.5 million decrease in revenue. Telecommunications Operating revenue from telecommunications in 2001 was $152.0 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 20.1%, compared to $126.6 million in 2000. Operating earnings from telecommunications in 2001 were $48.0 million, an increase of $7.9 million, or 19.7%, compared to $40.1 million in 2000. EBITDA from telecommunications in 2001 was $62.7 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 21.7%, compared to $51.5 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of telecommunications operating earnings to telecommunications EBITDA). Operating revenue from wholesale services in 2001 was $102.6 million, an increase of $18.4 million, or 21.9%, compared to $84.2 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to strong demand for our services and the network expansion into Michigan and Indiana. Monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of 2001 was $8.1 million compared to $7.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $5.5 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $2.9 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. Operating revenue from commercial services in 2001 was $49.4 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 16.5%, compared to $42.4 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in data services. Monthly recurring revenue from commercial data services at the end of 2001 was $3.0 million compared to $2.8 million at the beginning of 2001 and $2.4 million at the beginning of 2000. During 2001, new customers and new circuit connections of $0.8 million in monthly recurring revenue were partially offset by service disconnections, price reductions and lost customers. The increase in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily attributed to the $25.4 million increase in revenue offset by a decrease in profit margins due to price reductions. We expect continued price reductions and service disconnections will cause a downward trend in earnings in 2002. WorldCom and Global Crossing together accounted for 22.5% and 23.7% of our telecommunications operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of the ongoing business from either of these 2 customers would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and commercial customers in advance of providing services. Most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided. Printing Services Operating revenue from printing services in 2001 was $114.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 6.8%, compared to $107.3 million in 2000. The operating loss from printing services in 2001 was $0.8 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, compared to earnings of $3.3 million in 2000. EBITDA from printing services was $5.4 million in 2001, a decrease of $4.6 million, or 46.0%, compared to $10.0 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of printing services operating earnings to printing services EBITDA). The increase in printing services operating revenue was primarily attributed to an increase in assembly services. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily attributed to $2.3 million in expense related to the transition of the Eastern and Western Regions into one operational unit called IPC U.S. Operations and $0.7 million in costs related to the shutdown of operations in Ireland. A large computer hardware OEM (original equipment manufacturer) accounted for 29.8% and 24.4% of our printing services revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 38 Other Other operating revenue in 2001 was $86.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 3.7%, compared to $90.1 million in 2000. Other operating losses in 2001 were $3.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 11.6%, compared to losses of $4.0 million in 2000. Other EBITDA in 2001 was $0.1 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2000 (see page 35 for a reconciliation of other operating earnings to other EBITDA). The following table presents our other operating revenue, operating earnings and EBITDA by business for 2001 and 2000: 2001 2000 Direct Corporate Direct Corporate Label Marketing and Label Marketing and Printing Services Eliminations Total Printing Services Eliminations Total (in millions) Operating revenue............ $ 55.7 $ 35.9 $ (4.8) $ 86.8 $ 59.6 $ 34.3 $ (3.8) $ 90.1 Operating earnings........... $ (0.6) $ (1.2) $ (1.7) $ (3.5) $ (0.9) $ 0.1 $ (3.2) $ (4.0) EBITDA....................... $ 1.4 $ 0.0 $ (1.3) $ 0.1 $ 1.6 $ 1.3 $ (2.6) $ 0.3 The decrease in operating revenue was primarily attributed to the March 2001 sale of the Milwaukee label printing business offset by the increase in print and mail services in our direct marketing services business. Operating revenue in 2001 was adversely impacted by the terrorist attacks and the anthrax scare, which resulted in advertisers reducing their use of direct mail. Included in operating revenue from our direct marketing services was $21.3 million and $19.7 million of postage amounts billed to customers in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001 and 2000, the operating losses were primarily attributed to an increase in the litigation reserve. SAB/Miller Brewing Company accounted for approximately 47.4% and 27.5% of our label printing operating revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2001, our label printing business was in the first year of a 5 year contract with SAB/Miller Brewing Company. The loss of SAB/Miller Brewing Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Non Operating Income and Taxes from Continuing Operations Interest income and dividends in 2001 were $1.6 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 23.1%, compared to $1.3 million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributed to the increase in cash available for commercial paper and money market investments throughout 2001. Interest expense was $0.4 million in 2001 and 2000. Gross interest expense from borrowings under our credit agreement in 2001 was $0.5 million compared to $1.3 million in 2000. Interest expense capitalized as part of our construction of the Journal Sentinel production facility in 2001 was $0.1 million compared to $0.9 million in 2000. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 42.0% in 2001 compared to 40.1% in 2000. The difference between the statutory federal tax rate and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction of deferred tax assets for state net operating losses. Discontinued Operations Net revenue from discontinued operations in 2001 was $15.2 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 21.2%, compared to $19.3 million in 2000. Net assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2001 were $3.3 million. The loss from discontinued operations in 2001 was $2.2 million compared to $0.1 million in 2000. Applicable income tax benefits in 2001 was $0.5 million and $0.6 million in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity and capital requirements have been to pay dividends that have supported employee ownership and to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. Since 2000, we have also required liquidity to purchase units in JESTA from employees and former employees. Historically, we have relied on cash flow from operations and, in 2002, supplemented these cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility, to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements. We believe that current cash balances, which were $8.5 million at December 31, 2002, expected cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate for the foreseeable future to provide our working capital, debt service, capital expenditures and cash dividends. 39 Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities was $86.1 million in 2002 compared to $118.4 million in 2001 and $133.1 million in 2000. The decrease was mainly due to funding of the pension plan obligations of $44.5 million in 2002. Cash used for investing activities was $51.4 million in 2002 compared to $108.1 million in 2001 and $94.0 million in 2000. Capital expenditures for property and equipment were $53.2 million in 2002, $90.2 million in 2001 and $96.8 million in 2000. We continued to invest in the building of our daily newspaper production facility, digital television equipment and upgrades to the telecommunications fiber optic network. Cash used for acquisitions was zero in 2002, $22.1 million in 2001 and $8.0 million in 2000. Cash received from sales of assets was $1.5 million in 2002, $5.2 million in 2001, including $4.4 million from the sale of certain of the assets of the Milwaukee label printing operation, and $3.2 million in 2000. In 2000, we received $7.1 million from the redemption of the preferred stock received from the 1995 sale of Perry Printing, a former subsidiary. Cash used for financing activities was $31.7 million in 2002 compared to $11.9 million in 2001 and $33.0 million in 2000. We increased our borrowing under our credit agreement by $86.4 million in 2002. The increased borrowing was primarily used to purchase units of beneficial interest from employees and former employees and for funding of pension plan obligations. In 2002, purchases of units were $125.3 million compared with $84.4 million in 2001 and $77.1 million in 2000. Sales of units were $38.9 million, $101.8 million and $90.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We paid cash dividends of $31.6 million, $37.9 million and $36.8 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Cash used for discontinued operations was $3.4 million in 2002 and $3.7 million in 2000. Cash provided by discontinued operations was $0.5 million in 2001. We have a $120.0 million bank revolving credit agreement, expiring May 30, 2003, to support our cash requirements. As of December 31, 2002, we had borrowings of $90.8 million under this credit agreement, including $2.8 million bearing interest at the base rate of 4.25% and $88.0 million bearing interest at the LIBOR based rate of 2.40%, and immediately available credit of $29.2 million. We presently expect to extend this credit agreement for approximately 1 year. Stock Trust As of December 31, 2002, our treasury, our employees, and former employees owned units representing beneficial ownership of 90% of our stock. As of the end of 2002, we believe that employees and former employees had outstanding balances under demand notes secured by pledges of units from various financial institutions totaling approximately $433.1 million. Eligible optionees under the stock trust, including certain categories of designated employees, the Grant family shareholders and us, have the right to purchase units offered for sale. We are not obligated to purchase units, though in recent years prior to the suspension of trading on October 25, 2002, we have elected to do so for the convenience of stock trust unitholders. On October 25, 2002, our board of directors determined to indefinitely suspend our purchase and sale of units and also directed us to explore potential sources for additional permanent capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional permanent capital, or if we do, what the terms or structure will be or the extent to which new capital will be used to purchase units offered for sale. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual obligations are summarized below. Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other long term liabilities................. $ 3.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.1 $ 1.0 Operating leases............................ 69.1 15.7 33.3 20.1 Total contractual obligations............... $ 72.8 $ 17.3 $ 34.4 $ 21.1 Other long term liabilities consist primarily of obligations for non compete agreements resulting from acquisitions and deposits received from subleases of building operating leases. We lease office space, certain broadcasting facilities, distribution centers, printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases. Some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses, as well as provisions for the payment of utilities, maintenance and taxes by us. 40 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Other Commitments Total Less than 1 year 1 4 years After 4 years (in millions) Other contractual commitments............... $ 122.4 $ 39.4 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 Standby letters of credit................... 1.2 1.2 Total other commitments..................... $ 123.6 $ 40.6 $ 82.9 $ 0.1 A purchase commitment for newsprint for our publishing businesses, which runs through 2006, from a newsprint supplier as of December 31, 2002, was $104.7 million. The commitment is based on market prices for quantities we determine will meet our newsprint requirements over the term of the contract. In the unlikely event that newsprint is no longer required in our business, our commitment would expire without obligation. Purchase commitments related to capital expenditures for our daily newspapers new production facility were approximately $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002. We expect to spend up to $112.4 million on this project scheduled to be completed in early 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we have spent $102.7 million on this project. In addition, we have the right to broadcast certain television programs during the years 2003 2008 under contracts aggregating $8.3 million. We have $1.2 million of standby letters of credit for business insurance purposes. Critical Accounting Policies Our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, property and equipment, intangible assets, income taxes, litigation, pension and other postretirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for doubtful accounts We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We specifically review historical write off activity by market, large customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (such as bankruptcy filings, credit history, etc.), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history, the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment. If our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results, increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required. Property and equipment We assign useful lives for our property and equipment based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate the majority of the property and equipment. A change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a companys assets, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales. Changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles Goodwill, broadcast licenses and other indefinite lived intangible assets account for 32.9% and 34.6% of total assets in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under Statement No. 142 require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value, including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses. Additionally, the 41 fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed. Accordingly, we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under Statement No. 142 to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates, and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase, respectively. Accrued Income Taxes The Internal Revenue Service and various state Departments of Revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns. From time to time, the IRS and the state Departments of Revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged. The final disposition of any positions challenged by the IRS or state Departments of Revenue could require us to make additional tax payments. Nonetheless, we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters. Accrued Litigation We are subject to various legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims. When necessary, we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims. The estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. We believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Employee Benefits We are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims. A third party administrator is used to process all claims. Liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience. Liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future. We rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding. We provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations such as: o the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations; o the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations; o the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations; and o the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid postretirement benefits. Moodys Aa Corporate bonds, as of the measurement date, is the benchmark we use to determine the assumed discount rate, which was reduced from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.75% for 2002. We make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits, such as the expected rate of return on plan assets (decreased from 9.5% in 2001 to 8.5% in 2002) and the rate of compensation increase (4.5% in 2002 and 2001). Changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan. We review these assumptions on an annual basis. We also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine post retirement benefit costs other than pension. We provide the actuarial firms with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation. These assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation. The discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation. The medical cost of inflation is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations. New Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142. Statement No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. As required by Statement No. 142, we performed transitional impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The resulting impairment charges of $7.7 million ($6.5 million after tax) were recorded during the first quarter ended March 24, 2002 and are reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of earnings. 42 Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of, as well as broadening the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations. Accordingly, the closures of Fox Cities Newspapers and IPC Communication Services, S.A., as discussed in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, have been treated as discontinued operations. In June 2002, Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," was issued. Statement No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies the previous guidance on the subject. It requires, among other things, that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred rather than at the commitment date to the exit or disposal plan. The provisions for Statement No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Accordingly, Statement No. 146 may affect when future costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized. Effect of Inflation Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation. We have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity, cost containment programs and, where the competitive environment exists, increased selling prices. However, changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs, which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term notes payable to banks and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business. However, a 10% change in the interest rate is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings before income taxes. In addition, we have shut down our operations outside the United States and have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments. Many of our unitholders have borrowed funds to pay for their purchase of units. Dividends on our common stock passed through to our unitholders have in the past helped our unitholders make required periodic interest payments on those loans. Increases in the interest rates on unitholder loans could result in our unitholders seeking increased dividends from us. Dividends are established by our board of directors in their sole discretion, and we are under no obligation to pay dividends on our common stock. A 10% increase in the interest rate on unitholder loans is not expected to have a material impact on dividends declared by our board of directors. 43
