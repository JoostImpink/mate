Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We provide a suite of integrated pressure control and related services to onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration and development companies, principally in North America, South America, North Africa, West Africa, the Middle East and Asia, including training, contingency planning, well plan reviews, audits, inspection services, engineering services, pressure control equipment rental services, hydraulic snubbing workovers, well completions and plugging and abandonment services. 22 Table of Contents On March 3, 2006, we acquired the hydraulic well control business (HWC) of Oil States International, Inc. As a result of the acquisition, we acquired the ability to provide hydraulic units for emergency well control situations and various well intervention solutions involving workovers, well drilling, well completions and plugging and abandonment services. Hydraulic units may be used for both routine and emergency well control situations in the oil and gas industry. A hydraulic unit is a specially designed rig used for moving tubulars in and out of a wellbore using hydraulic pressure. These units may also be used for snubbing operations to service wells under pressure. When a unit is snubbing, it is pushing pipe or tubulars into the wellbore against wellbore pressures. On July 31, 2007, we acquired Rock Springs, Wyoming based StassCo Pressure Control, LLC (StassCo), and the transaction was effective for accounting and financial purposes as of August 1, 2007. StassCo operates four hydraulic rig assist units in the Cheyenne Basin, Wyoming, and its presence in the Rockies is a key to our strategy to expand North America land operations. We added our pressure control equipment rental service line to our suite of pressure control services during the fourth quarter of 2007. Our pressure control equipment and operating personnel are utilized primarily during the drilling and completion phases of oil and gas wells. We are currently operating this business in our North America regions, classified as the Gulf of Mexico, Mid Continent and Southeast and our Middle East international region. We plan to expand into other operating areas where we provide pressure control services. On February 10, 2009, we purchased John Wright Company (JWC) for approximately $10 million in a combination of cash and subordinated debt. Based in Houston, JWC provides a suite of relief well drilling and risk management services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. We are integrating the companys proprietary technology into our Safeguard program, which is currently our fastest growing service line. Demand for services depends on factors beyond our control, including the volume and type of drilling and workover activity, which is substantially influenced by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Wars, acts of terrorism and other unpredictable factors may affect demand for our services on a regional basis. Demand for our emergency well control, or critical well event, services is volatile and inherently unpredictable. As a result we expect to experience large fluctuations in our revenues from these services. Non critical services, included in our well intervention segment, while subject to typical industry volatility associated with commodity prices, drilling activity levels and the like, provide more stable revenues and our strategy continues to be to expand these product and service offerings while focusing on our core strength of pressure control services. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information contained in our periodic reports previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated herein by reference. Our summary consolidated operating results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Revenues $ 195,074 $ 209,237 $ 105,296 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 128,261 129,018 62,581 Operating expenses 31,037 30,599 17,792 Selling, general and administrative 10,306 10,304 5,904 Other operating expense 213 189 276 Depreciation and amortization 12,586 9,307 6,051 Operating income 12,671 29,820 12,692 Interest expense 3,756 2,546 2,584 Other (income) and expense, net 99 3 (532 ) Income tax expense 2,807 5,452 2,749 Net income $ 6,009 $ 21,819 $ 7,891 23 Table of Contents We operate in three business segments: Pressure Control, Well Intervention and Equipment Services. Intercompany transfers between segments were not material. Our accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. While cost of sales expenses are variable based upon the type of revenue generated, most of our operating expenses represent fixed costs for base labor charges, rent and utilities. For purposes of this presentation, operating expenses and depreciation and amortization have been charged to each segment based upon specific identification of expenses and a pro rata allocation of remaining non segment specific expenses are assigned between segments based upon relative revenues. Selling, general and administrat ive and corporate expenses have been allocated between segments in proportion to their relative revenue. Business segment operating data from continuing operations is presented for purposes of management discussion and analysis of operating results. The Pressure Control segment consists of personnel, equipment and services which are designed to reduce the number and severity of critical well events offered through our prevention and risk management programs, including training, contingency planning, well plan reviews, audits, inspection services and engineering services. This segment also consists of personnel, equipment and services provided during a critical well event. These services can include snubbing and equipment services rental equipment provided during a response which are designed to minimize response time and mitigate damage while maximizing safety. These services primarily utilize existing personnel to maximize utilization with only slight increases in fixed operating costs. Our Well Intervention segment consists of services that are designed to enhance production for oil and gas operators and reduce the number and severity of critical well events such as oil and gas well fires, blowouts, or other losses of control at the well. This segment includes services performed by hydraulic workover and snubbing units that are used to enhance production of oil and gas wells. These units are used for underbalanced drilling, workover, well completions and plugging and abandonment services. The Equipment Services segment includes our pressure control equipment rental and service business, which began as an expansion of the Companys existing services in 2007. We expect our Equipment Services segment to continue to benefit as a result of cross selling of our other services by our business development team and our expanded geographic presence. Information concerning operations in our three different business segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is presented below. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods to conform to the current presentation. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Revenues Pressure Control $ 87,613 $ 92 ,804 $ 36, 845 Well Intervention 81,027 97,167 66,580 Equipment Services 26,434 19,266 1,871 $ 195,074 $ 209,237 $ 105,296 Cost of Sales Pressure Control $ 56,769 $ 50,432 $ 16,719 Well Intervention 59,186 67,271 45,349 Equipment Services 12,306 11,315 513 $ 128,261 $ 129,018 $ 62,581 Operating Expenses (1) Pressure Control $ 14,243 $ 15,664 $ 9,017 Well Intervention 11,979 12,290 7,966 Equipment Services 4,815 2,645 809 $ 31,037 $ 30,599 $ 17,792 Selling, General and Administrative (2) Pressure Control $ 4,615 $ 4,499 $ 2,080 Well Intervention 4,507 5,035 4,006 Equipment Services 1,397 959 94 $ 10,519 $ 10,493 $ 6,180 Depreciation and Amortization (1) Pressure Control $ 639 $ 1,032 $ 663 Well Intervention 8,659 6,796 5,239 Equipment Services 3,288 1,479 149 $ 12,586 $ 9,307 $ 6,051 Operating Income(loss) Pressure Control $ 11,347 $ 21,177 $ 8,366 Well Intervention (3,304 ) 5,775 4,020 Equipment Services 4,628 2,868 306 $ 12,671 $ 29,820 $ 12,692 (1) Operating expenses and depreciation and amortization have been charged to each segment based upon specific identification of expenses and an allocation of remaining non segment specific expenses pro rata between segments based upon relative revenues. (2) Selling, general and administrative expenses have been allocated pro rata between segments based upon relative revenues and includes foreign currency translation. 24 Table of Contents Comparison of the Year ended December 31, 2009 with the Year ended December 31, 2008 Revenues Pressure Control revenues were $87,613,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $92,804,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a decrease of $5,191,000, or 5.6% in the current year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in response revenue partially offset by an increase in international revenue from prevention and risk management projects in North Africa and Asia. Well Intervention revenues were $81,027,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $97,167,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a decrease of $16,140,000, or 16.6% in the current year. The decrease was primarily due to the a project in Bangladesh that added $9.2 million in revenue in fiscal year 2008, the suspension of operations in Venezuela for most of the first and second quarters of 2009, reduced business in the Middle East, the loss of a tender in Egypt and a slowdown in the most of our North American regions. In the current year, we experienced revenue increases in Algeria and the Northeast and Southeast regions of North America as well as from the commencement of operations in North Africa. Equipment service revenues were $26,434,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $19,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $7,168,000, or 37.2% in the current year. This increase is due to the increase in capital used to expand our equipment rental and services business. Cost of Sales Pressure Control cost of sales was $56,769,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $50,432,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $6,337,000, or 12.6% in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of sales represented 64.8% of revenues compared to 54.3% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of revenue being associated with third party costs primarily due to a project in India in 2009. Well Intervention cost of sales was $59,186,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $67,271,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $8,085,000, or 12.0% in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cost of sales represented 73.0% of revenues compared to 69.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to carrying costs associated with our operations in Venezuela during our suspension of operations there. Equipment Services cost of sales was $12,306,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $11,315,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $991,000, or 8.8% in the current year. For the current year, cost of sales was 46.6% of revenue compared to 58.7% of revenue in the prior year. The cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decrease was primarily due to a lower proportion of revenue with third party costs in 2009 in relation to 2008 as the asset base for the service line increased. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses were $31,037,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $30,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $438,000, or 1.4% in the current year. During the current year, operating expenses represented 15.9% of revenues compared to 14.6% of revenues in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in employment costs as we continued to add personnel to pursue opportunities to grow our geographic presence and product offerings. The increases were partially offset by decreases in bonus accruals and bad debt expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10,519,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $10,493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, an decrease of $26,000 or 0.2% in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2009, SG&A expense represented 5.4% of consolidated revenues compared to 5.0% of revenues in the prior year. The increase in total SG&A expense was primarily due to increases in professional fees and employment costs which were partially offset by decreases in bonus accruals and advertising and customer relations expenses. 25 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3,279,000, or 35.2% between the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The increase was primarily due to the depreciation increase of $2,878,000 resulting from an increase in capitalized assets in 2009. The remaining increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of John Wright Company in February 2009. Those intangible assets consist of trade name, non compete agreement, proprietary software, process diagrams and customer relationships being amortized over 5 to15 year periods. Other intangible assets are related to the StassCo purchase and consist of customer relationships being amortized over a 13 year period and management non compete agreements being amortized over 5.5 and 3 .5 year periods. Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $1,210,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year period. This includes $471,000 for the increase in amortization of deferred financing charges resulting from the new syndicated credit agreement we entered into in February 2009 and the required write off of $146,000 of the remaining deferred financing charges related to the previous loan. The remaining increase was primarily a result of higher borrowings in the current year period. Other (Income) and Expense, Net Other income and expenses increased by $96,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of a $30,000 decrease in interest income. Income Tax Expense Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2,807,000, or 31.8% of pre tax income, compared to income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $5,452,000, or 20.0% of pre tax income. The Companys estimated annual effective tax rate reflects, among other items, our best estimates of operating results and foreign currency exchange rates. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Companys effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was adversely impacted by consolidating foreign losses from certain tax jurisdictions which do not generate future tax benefits. Comparison of the Year ended December 31, 2008 with the Year ended December 31, 2007 Revenues Pressure Control revenues were $92,804,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $36,845,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $55,959,000, or 151.9% in the current year. The largest increase resulted from revenue of $41,050,000 from a prevention and risk management international project which was completed in the fourth quarter. The remaining increase was primarily due to a higher level of international emergency response activity. Well Intervention revenues were $97,167,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $66,580,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $30,587,000, or 45.9% in the current year. The increase was due to higher utilization resulting from growth in our domestic and international hydraulic workover and snubbing services. Equipment service revenues were $19,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $1,871,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $17,395,000, or 929.7% in the current year. This increase is due to the domestic and international expansion of our equipment rental and services which began in August 2007. Cost of Sales Pressure Control cost of sales was $50,432,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $16,719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $33,713,000, or 201.6% in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of sales represented 54.3% of revenues compared to 45.4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. The percentage increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of revenue with related third party costs in 2008 in relation to 2007. Well Intervention cost of sales was $67,271,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $45,349,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $21,922,000, or 48.3% in the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cost of sales represented 69.2% of revenues compared to 68.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in cost of sales is generally attributable to the increased revenue volume. 26 Table of Contents Equipment Services cost of sales was $11,315,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $513,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $10,802,000, or 2105.7% in the current year. For the current year, cost of sales was 58.7% of revenue compared to 27.4% of revenue in the prior year. The percentage increase was primarily due to being more fully operational in 2008 as contrasted with a higher component of start up costs incurred in 2007. Operating Expenses Consolidated operating expenses were $30,599,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $17,792,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $12,807,000, or 72.0% in the current year. During the current year, operating expenses represented 14.6% of revenues compared to 16.9% of revenues in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses on an actual basis was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, incentive bonus, bad debt expense, travel and entertainment, tools and supplies, and professional fees as a result of the geographic expansion of all segments and the ramp up of our pressure control equipment rental services business. Operating expenses were also lower in 2007 due to a gain on disposal of assets during the year which did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2008. &# 160;The percentage of revenue decrease is primarily due to higher revenues in relation to increases in expenses due to the component of such expenses that are fixed and semi fixed. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10,493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $6,180,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $4,313,000, or 69.8% in the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2008, SG&A expense represented 5.0% of consolidated revenues compared to 5.9% of revenues in the prior year. The increase in actual SG&A expense is primarily due to higher salaries, incentive bonus, benefits, and marketing related expenses associated with the higher level of revenues and operating income exceeding plan. Depreciation and Amortization Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3,256,000, or 53.8% between the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The increase was primarily due to the depreciation increase of $2,959,000 resulting from an increase in capitalized assets in 2008. Additionally, amortization of intangible assets, related to our acquisition of StassCo Pressure Control LLC in August 2007, for the full year in 2008 compared to five months in 2007 was $512,000 and $215,000, respectively. The intangible assets consist of customer relationships being amortized over a 13 year period and management non compete agreements being amortized over 5.5 and 3.5 year periods. Interest Expense Interest expenses decreased by $38,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year period. The interest expense decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate and a lower balance on our term loan borrowings offset by an increase in our average revolver balance. Other (Income) and Expense, Net Other income and expenses increased by $535,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year period. The net expense increase was primarily a result of the decrease in interest income of $515,000 from the prior year period which was due to a reduction in funds available for investment in 2008. Income Tax Expense Income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $5,452,000, or 20% of pre tax income compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 of $2,749,000, or 25.8% of pre tax income. We determined that as a result of the acquisition of HWC we have experienced a change of control pursuant to limitations set forth in Section 382 of the IRS rules and regulations. As a result, we are limited to utilizing approximately $2.1 million of U.S. net operating losses (NOL) to offset U.S. taxable income generated during the tax year ended December 31, 2008 and expect similar dollar limits in future years until our U.S. NOLs are either completely used or expire. In 2008, the tax expense as a percent of pretax income was lower due to taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the U.S. and a tax benefit related to the utilization of future Net Operating Losses (NOLs) against taxable income in future years which was partially offset by estimated uncertain penalty and interest. All 2008 U.S. current tax expense was offset by utilization of NOLs and Foreign Tax Credits. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity At December 31, 2009, we had working capital of $47,004,000 compared to $40,169,000 at December 31, 2008. Our cash balance at December 31, 2009 was $7,357,000 compared to $6,220,000 at December 31, 2008. We ended the year with stockholders equity of $109,617,000, which increased by $7,856,000 when compared to $101,761,000 at December 31, 2008, primarily due to our net income of $6,009,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our primary liquidity needs are to fund working capital, capital expenditures such as expanding our equipment services fleet of equipment and replacing support equipment for our hydraulic workover and snubbing service line, debt service and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. We generated cash from operating activities in fiscal year 2009 of $11,220,000 compared to $22,906,000 in 2008. Cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $6,009,000, non cash charges of $14,689,000 and decreases in receivables of $455,000. Non cash charges were comprised primarily of $12,586,000 of depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation of $1,693,000, bad debt provision of $480,000, and excess tax expense of $91,000 that were offset by a reduction due to a deferred tax credit of $161,000. These positive cash flows were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $6,059,000, increases in other assets of $1,929,000, increases in inventory of $823,000, a gain on sale/disposal of assets of $654,000 and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $468,000. Receivables decreased due to more timely collections, primarily from our foreign customers. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in accrued compensation and foreign income taxes. Other assets increased primarily due to deferred financing charges related to the new credit agreement and due to prepaid agent commissions. Inventory increased as a result of supporting future operations, and prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to an increase in insurance cost. Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $17,478,000 and $28,120,000, respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $14,726,000 and $28,537,000 during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2009 consisted of purchases of assets for our hydraulic workover and snubbing services and our rental equipment services, the acquisition of the abrasive jet cutting systems and the acquisition of John Wright Company (JWC), while our 2008 capital expenditures were primarily purchases of assets for our hydraulic workover and snubbing services and our rental equipment services. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized insurance proceeds of $3,432,000 on a claim related to one of our hydraulic workover units and portions of its auxiliary equipment and inventory that fell from a third party freight vessel into the sea off the coast of Libya. The insurance proceeds were used for replacement of equipment and inventory. This claim resulted in a gain on disposal of assets totaling $347,000 in the current year. On July 31, 2007, we acquired Rock Springs, Wyoming based StassCo Pressure Control, LLC (StassCo) for cash consideration of $10,694,000, net of cash acquired and including transaction costs, but excluding a payable to the former owners of $500,000. This transaction was funded utilizing cash proceeds available from our underwritten public offering of common stock in April 2007. StassCo performed snubbing services in the Cheyenne basin, Wyoming and operated four hydraulic rig assist units. On February 10, 2009, we acquired Houston based John Wright Company (JWC) for cash consideration of $6,668,000, net of cash acquired, and issued a promissory note to John. W. Wright for $3,000,000. This transaction was funded utilizing cash obtained under our new credit facility. Our net cash generated from financing activities was $7,395,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the new credit facility entered into on February 10, 2009, which generated proceeds of $9,701,000, net of pay down of $3,927,000 on our previous credit facility and repayment of all $21,166,000 of related party debt. We generated net cash of $4,933,000 from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $5,374,000. On December 31, 2009, we had cash of $2,106,000 denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and residing in a Venezuelan bank and Venezuela trade accounts receivables owing from the countrys national oil companies of $14,355,000 including $5,149,000 denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and $9,206,000 denominated in U.S. Dollars, of which $6,076,000 is settled in Bolivares Fuertes and $3,130,000 is settled in U.S.Dollars. The U.S. Dollar settled amount includes $893,000 recorded on a cash basis and is classified as deferred revenue. The Venezuelan trade accounts receivable is down considerably from the $20,993,000 exposure we had at March 31, 2009 when we temporarily suspended operations due to our concern over our total working capital exposure in Venezuela. 28 Table of Contents The table below shows the amounts of Venezuela trade accounts receivables as of March 31, 2009 in relation to the amounts of those same receivables uncollected as of June 30, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009. March 31, 2009 June 30, 2009 September 30, 2009 December 31, 2009 Bolivares Fuertes $ 10,740 $ 9,135 $ 2,935 $ 2,901 U.S. Dollar denominated settled in Bolivares Fuertes 6,218 4,973 4,156 3,826 U.S. Dollar denominated settled in U.S. Dollars 4,035 4,005 4,005 3,054 Total $ 20,993 $ 18,113 $ 11,096 $ 9,781 As of December 31, 2009, we had net working capital exposure of $10,517,000, including $1,229,000 denominated in Bolivares Fuertes and $9,288,000 denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our Venezuelan operations currently fund liquidity needs from the working capital that is generated by Venezuelan operations. Our international operations give rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in U.S. Dollars. We typically endeavor to denominate all of our contracts in U.S. Dollars to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and we partially do this in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government implemented a foreign currency control regime on February 5, 2003. This has resulted in currency controls that restrict the conversion of the Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar Fuerte, to U.S. Dollars. The Company has registered with the control board (CADIVI) in order to have a portion of total receivables in U.S dollar payments made directly to a United States bank account. Effective January 1, 2006, and related to our acquisition of the hydraulic well control business of Oil States, we changed our functional currency in Venezuela from the Venezuelan Bolivar to the U.S. Dollar. This change allowed us to have one consistent functional currency after the acquisition. Accumulated other comprehensive loss reported in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity before January 1, 2006 totaled $1.2 million and consisted solely of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in Venezuela prior to changing our functional currency. The currency translation adjustment recorded up through the date of the change in functional currency will only be adjusted in the event of a full or partial disposition of our investment in Venezuela. The Security and Exchange Commission Regulation Committees International Practices Task Forces Center for Audit Quality has deemed Venezuelas currency as hyperinflationary effective January 1, 2010. Effective January 11, 2010 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and to 4.30 for non essential goods and services. The estimated unfavorable impact of the devaluation to the Companys first quarter results is approximately $650,000 with the exchange rate movement from 2.15 to 4.30. The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including our ability to take actions to mitigate the effect of the devaluation, further actions of the Venezuelan government, and general economic conditions such as continued inflation and future customer payments and spending. Credit Facilities/Capital Resources On March 3, 2006, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which established a revolving credit facility capacity totaling $10.3 million, and a term credit facility totaling $9.7 million. The loan balance outstanding on December 31, 2008 was $3.9 million on the term credit facility and $6.4 million on the revolving credit facility. This line was replaced with a new facility described below. On February 10, 2009, we entered into a new $54.4 million syndicated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of America, N.A. (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaced our existing term and revolving credit facilities. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan in the principal amount of $34.4 million and a revolving credit line in the principal amount of up to $20 million. The term loan facility requires regularly scheduled quarterly payments of principal and interest. Quarterly principal payments on the term facility are $1.72 million and commenced June 30, 2009. Amounts repaid under the term loan cannot be re borrowed. The term loan and the revolving credit line each mature on February 10, 2012. The loan balance outstan ding on December 31, 2009 was $29.2 million on the term credit facility and $9.9 million on the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility borrowing base was $16.6 million at December 31, 2009, adjusted for $1.1 million outstanding under letters of credit and guarantees, leaving $5.6 million available to be drawn under the facility. 29 Table of Contents Interest under the Credit Agreement accrues at a base rate (which is the greatest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.50%, Wells Fargos prime rate, or the daily one month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1.50%) plus a margin ranging from 4.25% to 4.75% per annum or, at our option, at a Eurodollar base rate plus a margin ranging from 5.25% to 5.75% per annum. We will also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit line ranging from 1.30% to 1.40% per annum. The commitment fee and the margin applicable to advances under the Credit Agreement increase within the applicable range if the ratio of our debt to adjusted EBITDA rises above 1.50. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term credit facility at December 31, 2009 was 7.75% and 5.75%, respectively. The Credit Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by all of our current and future domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors) and secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the Guarantors, including a pledge of all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the capital stock of our first tier foreign subsidiaries. We have not entered into any interest rate hedges with respect to the Credit Agreement but may elect to do so in the future. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability and the Guarantors ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends on or repurchase stock; make certain types of investments; sell stock of our subsidiaries; restrict dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; merge with other companies; and spend in excess of $30 million per year on capital expenditures. The Credit Agreement also requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including, (1) the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth of not less than 85% of our tangible net worth as of March 31, 2009, plus an amount equal to 50% of consolidated net income for each succeeding fiscal quarter plus 100% of future net proceeds from the sale of equity securities, (2) a maximum ratio of funded debt to adjusted EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters of 2.25 to 1.00, and (3) a minimum ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges of 1.50 to 1.00. We are in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2009 and expect to be in compliance for the next twelve months. We utilized initial borrowings of approximately $40 million under the Credit Agreement to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities, repay all of the $21.2 million of senior subordinated notes held by Oil States International and to fund our purchase of John Wright Company. We believe that cash on hand, cash from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the coming twelve months. Disclosure of on and off balance sheet debts and commitments Our known contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 are reflected in the table below. Future commitments (000s) Description TOTAL Year 1 Years 2&3 Years 4&5 Thereafter Long and short term debt and notes payable Term loan $ 29,240 $ 6,880 $ 22,360 $ $ Revolving credit facility $ 9,901 $ $ 9,901 $ $ Subordinated debt $ 3,000 $ $ 3,000 $ $ Capital lease payments (including interest) $ 161 $ 60 $ 101 $ $ Future minimum lease payments $ 8,683 $ 2,579 $ 2,969 $ 1,516 $ 1,619 Total commitments $ 50,985 $ 9,519 $ 38,331 $ 1,516 $ 1,619 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009 we had no off balance sheet arrangements. 30 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies In response to the SECs Release No. 33 8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure about Critical Accounting Policies, we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment. We have identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, share based compensation and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized on our service contracts primarily on the basis of contractual day rates as the work is completed. Revenue and cost from product and equipment sales is recognized upon customer acceptance and contract completion. Revenue excludes taxes assessed based on revenue such as sales or value added taxes. Effective June, 2009, the Company began deferring for the portion of Venezuela service revenue to be settled in U.S. dollars, and those amounts will be recognized as revenue when earned and cash is collected. At December 31, 2009, the amount of defe rred revenue related to VZ services was $893,000 and is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We recognize revenues under the WELLSURE program as follows: (a) initial deposits for pre event type services are recognized ratably over the life of the contract period, typically twelve months (b) revenues and billings for pre event type services provided are recognized when the insurance carrier has billed the operator and the revenues become determinable and (c) revenues and billings for contracting and event services are recognized based upon our predetermined day rates and sub contracted work as incurred. WELLSURE revenues represented approximately 1% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Cost of sale Cost of sales includes all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, related workmans compensation insurance, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Operating expense includes costs related to service line management and support, including business development and delivery expenses. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We assess our credit risk and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for any accounts which we deem doubtful of collection. Share based compensation We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant and for the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees, consultants and directors; including employee stock options based on estimated fair values. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short term nature of those instruments and because debt is at a floating rate. We use available market rates to estimate the fair value of debt which approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2009. Goodwill Goodwill is not being amortized, but is being reviewed at least annually for impairment or more often if changes in facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. Goodwill is associated with the March 2006 acquisition of the hydraulic well control business (HWC) of Oil States International, Inc., the July 2007 acquisition of Stassco Pressure Control LLC (StassCo) and the February 2009 acquisition of the John Wright Company and as is further described in Note E. The goodwill for the HWC and StassCo acquisitions have been assigned to the Well Intervention segment, and the goodwill for the John Wright acquisition has been assigned to the Pressure Control segment. &#160 ;These segments are deemed the reporting units for this review. Fair values of the reporting units are determined based on internal management estimates using a combination of discounted cash flows and market comparable companies. We perform the annual reviews for possible impairment in the fourth calendar quarter of each year, and the impairment testing consists of a two step process. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, and utilizes a future cash flow analysis based on the estimates and assumptions of our forecasted long term growth model. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares th e implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount for 2009 and 2008, and no goodwill impairment was recognized based on the evaluations performed at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 31 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes: a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year; a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. We determine deferred taxes separately for each tax paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures: identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences; measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate; measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate; measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our primary deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 are related to $26.9 million in available federal net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs), net of expiring losses and $1.8 million of foreign tax credits. The foreign tax credits will expire in 2019. The NOLs will expire in varying amounts during the years 2020 through 2023 if they are not first used to offset taxable income that we generate. Our ability to utilize a significant portion of the available NOLs are currently limited due to a change in control that occurred during 2006. As of December 31, 2009, we have three years of NOL for which we do not have a valuation allowance. We believe that the Companys forecasted taxable income during the next three years will allow us to utilize those NOLs. The remaining years NOLs hav e a full valuation allowance. We will continue to monitor this in future periods and adjust the allowance accordingly. Our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment in the use of assumptions and estimates. Additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results. Unforeseen events may significantly impact these variables, and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to our continuing operations. Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $2.8 million, or 31.84% of pretax income. Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $5.5 million, or 20% of pretax income. 32 Table of Contents We have operations in jurisdictions other than the United States. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including income actually earned, income deemed earned, and revenue based tax withholding. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties, and related authorities in each jurisdiction. Changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year. Tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates, and related entities are subject to examination in the normal course of business by tax authorities. These examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. Predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. Factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. We provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement meth odology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. They also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We account for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position before being recognized in the financial statements. The Company evaluated all tax years still subject to potential audit under state, federal and foreign income tax law in reaching its accounting conclusions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Tax years subsequent to 2005 remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions, tax years subsequent to 2004 remain open in Venezuela, tax years subsequent to 2004 remain open in Algeria, tax tears subsequent to 2004 remain open in the Congo, and tax years subsequent to 2007 for Libya. During 2007, the Company recorded a charge of $616,000 relating t o unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recorded a charge of $196,000 and $206,000 for the tax years ending December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to fair value accounting and reporting as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis. These changes define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance applies to other GAAP that require or permit fair value measurements and is to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The adoption of these changes, as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. These provisions will be applied at such time a fair value measurement of a nonfinancia l asset or nonfinancial liability is required, which may result in a fair value that is materially different than would have been calculated prior to the adoption of these changes. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB on April 1, 2009 to accounting for business combinations. These changes apply to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from certain contingencies and requires (i) an acquirer to recognize at fair value, at the acquisition date, an asset acquired or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period otherwise the asset or liability should be recognized at the acquisition date if certain defined criteria are met; (ii) contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination be recognized initially at fair value; (iii) subsequent measurements of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies be based on a systematic and rational method depending on their nature and contingent consideration arrangements be measured subsequently; and (iv) disclosures of the amounts and measurement basis of such assets and liabilities and the nature of the contingencies. These changes were applied to the acquisition completed on February 10, 2009 (see Note E). Overall the adoption of this change did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB to consolidation accounting and reporting. These changes establish accounting and reporting for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This guidance defines a non controlling interest, previously called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. These changes require, among other items, that a non controlling interest be included in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity separate from the parents equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parents and non controlling interests shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent a nd non controlling interest all on the consolidated statement of operations; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. The adoption of this change did not have a material impact on the Companys results from operations or financial position. 33 Table of Contents On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB to the calculation of earnings per share. These changes state that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method for all periods presented (see Note J). The adoption of this change did not have a material impact on the Companys results from operations or financial position. On June 30, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB to fair value accounting. These changes provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. This guidance is necessary to maintain the overall objective of fair value measurements, which is that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The adoption of these changes did not have a material impact on the Companys results from operations or financial position. On June 30, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB to fair value disclosures of financial instruments. These changes require a publicly traded company to include disclosures about the fair value of its financial instruments whenever it issues summarized financial information for interim reporting periods. Such disclosures include the fair value of all financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, whether recognized or not recognized in the statement of financial position; the related carrying amount of these financial instruments; and the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value. The adoption of these changes did not have a material impact on the Companys results from operations or financial positio n. On June 30, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the FASB to accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, otherwise known as subsequent events. Specifically, these changes set forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The adoption of these changes had no impact on the finan cial statements as management already followed a similar approach prior to the adoption of this new guidance. We have evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2009 to March 3, 2010 which is the date the financial statements were issued. On September 30, 2009, the Company adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to the authoritative hierarchy of GAAP. These changes establish the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts; instead the FASB will issue Acc ounting Standards Updates. Accounting Standards Updates will not be authoritative in their own right as they will only serve to update the Codification. These changes and the Codification itself do not change GAAP. Other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced, the adoption of these changes had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued changes to the accounting for revenue recognition under multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. These changes address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (a) vendor specific objective evidence; (b) third party evidence; or (c) estimates. This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor&# 8217;s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. These changes are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. A company may elect, but will not be required, to adopt these changes retrospectively for all prior periods. Management is currently evaluating the requirements of these changes and has not yet determined the impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). The guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance wil l have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations. During the year 2009, approximately 68% of our total revenues were generated internationally. Due to the unpredictable nature of the critical well events that drive our response segment revenues and fluctuations in regional demand for our well intervention segment products and services, the percentage of our revenues that are derived from a particular country, geographic region or business segment can be expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Although most transactions are denominated in U. S. Dollars, the foreign currency risks that we are subject to may vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the countries in which we are then operating and the payment terms under the contractual arrangements we ha ve with our customers. During the year 2009, work in Venezuela and Algeria contributed 7% and 19% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, which was collectively increased slightly from the prior year period when revenues from these countries represented 12% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues. Remaining foreign revenues for year 2009 were primarily generated in India and Libya, with each representing over 12% of total international revenues for the period. During the first quarter of 2009, we suspended operations in Venezuela pending payment on certain outstanding receivables from the countrys national oil companies. The Company resumed operations in the second quarter as partial payment was received. Effective June 2009, for that portion of all future services to be settled in U.S. Dollars, revenue will be recognized as it is earned and cash is collected. As of December 31, 2009 this deferred revenue totaled $893,000. The current accounts receivable to be settled in U.S. Dollars totaled approximately $4.2 million at December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company has collected payment on Bolivares Fuertes receivables totaling $10.5 million, on Bolivares Fuertes receivables denominated in U.S. Dollars totaling $4.7 million, and $1.7 million U.S. Dollar denominated receivables settled in U.S Dollars. Since the end of the first quarter and as of December 31, 2009, the Company has collected payment on Bolivars Fuertes receivables totaling $10.4 million, on U.S. Dollar denominated receivables settled in Bolivares Fuertes totaling $4.1 million, and on U.S. Dollar denominated receivables settled in U.S. Dollars totaling $1.7 million. The Company continues efforts to collect accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. Management is closely monitoring the situation, expects to continue to maintain and operate its facilities in Venezuela, and does not believe a reserve is necessary for current uncollected receivables. Effective January 11, 2010 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and to 4.30 for non essential goods and services. The estimated unfavorable impac t of the devaluation to the Companys first quarter results is approximately $650,000 with the exchange rate movement from 2.15 to 4.30. For more information regarding our foreign currency risks, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity. On December 31, 2009, our total Venezuela net working capital excluding U.S. Dollars in a U.S. bank account was $10,517,000, and our net book value of property and equipment was $4,175,000. Our debt consists of both fixed interest and variable interest rate debt; consequently, our earnings and cash flows, as well as the fair values of our fixed rate debt instruments, are subject to interest rate risk. We have a term loan and a revolving line of credit that are subject to movements in interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, we had floating rate obligations totaling approximately $39.1 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Facilities/Capital Resources for more information. These floating rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates. If the floating interest rate was to increase by 10% from the December 31, 2009 levels, our interest expense would increase by a total of approximately $233,000 annually.
