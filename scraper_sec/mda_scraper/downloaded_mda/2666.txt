Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements When used in this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, may, intends, believes, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the following: our performance is directly affected by changing conditions in global financial markets generally and in the equity markets particularly, and a decline or a lack of sustained growth in these markets may result in decreased advisory fees or performance fees and a corresponding decline (or lack of growth) in our operating results and in the cash flow distributable to us from our Affiliates; we cannot be certain that we will be successful in finding or investing in additional investment management firms on favorable terms, that we will be able to consummate announced investments in new investment management firms, or that existing and new Affiliates will have favorable operating results; we may need to raise capital by making long term or short term borrowings or by selling shares of our common stock or other securities in order to finance investments in additional investment management firms or additional investments in our existing Affiliates, and we cannot be sure that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all; and those certain other factors discussed under the caption Risk Factors. These factors (as well as those discussed above under Risk Factors) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. We will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Overview We are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of mid sized investment management firms (our Affiliates). We pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business, additional investments in mid sized investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our Affiliates businesses and growth prospects. Through our Affiliates, we manage approximately $241.1 billion in assets (as of December 31, 2006) in more than 300 investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels: Mutual Fund, Institutional and High Net Worth. We believe that our diversification across asset classes, investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments. The following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels. Our Affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than 100 mutual funds. These funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker/dealers, major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments. 20 In the Institutional distribution channel, our Affiliates offer more than 150 investment products across more than 35 different investment styles, including small, small/mid, mid and large capitalization value, growth equity and emerging markets. In addition, our Affiliates offer quantitative, alternative and fixed income products. Through this distribution channel, our Affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments, defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities, and Taft Hartley plans, with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients. The High Net Worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups. The first group consists principally of direct relationships with high net worth individuals and families and charitable foundations. For these clients, our Affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services. The second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries, generally brokerage firms or other sponsors. Our Affiliates provide investment management services through more than 90 managed account and wrap programs. In December 2006, we acquired a majority equity interest in Chicago Equity Partners, a firm that manages a wide range of U.S. equity and fixed income products across multiple capitalization sectors and investment styles. Chicago Equity Partners client base includes over 120 institutional investors, including public funds, corporations, endowments and foundations, Taft Hartley plan sponsors and certain mutual fund advisors. We operate our business through our Affiliates in our three principal distribution channels, maintaining each Affiliates distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure. In each case, our Affiliates are organized as separate firms, and their operating or shareholder agreements are tailored to provide appropriate incentives for our Affiliate management owners and to address the particular characteristics of that Affiliate while enabling us to protect our interests. We have revenue sharing arrangements with most of our Affiliates. Under these arrangements, a percentage of revenue is generally allocated for use by management of that Affiliate in paying operating expenses of the Affiliate, including salaries and bonuses. We call this the Operating Allocation. The portion of the Affiliates revenue that is allocated to the owners of that Affiliate (including us) is called the Owners Allocation. Each Affiliate allocates its Owners Allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that Affiliate. Where we hold a minority equity interest, our revenue sharing arrangement generally allocates a percentage of the revenue to us, with the balance to be used to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the Affiliate management owners. One of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for Affiliate managers by allowing them to: participate in the growth of their firms revenue, which may increase their compensation from the Operating Allocation and their distributions from the Owners Allocation; and control operating expenses, thereby increasing the portion of the Operating Allocation that is available for growth initiatives and compensation. An Affiliates managers therefore have incentives to increase revenue (thereby increasing the Operating Allocation and their share of the Owners Allocation) and to control expenses (thereby increasing the amount of Operating Allocation available for their compensation). If actual operating expenses are less than an Affiliates Operating Allocation, the profits allocated to the managers will increase. These profits are referred to as Minority interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income. 21 An Affiliates Operating Allocation is structured to cover its operating expenses. However, should actual operating expenses exceed the Operating Allocation, our contractual share of cash under the Owners Allocation generally has priority over the allocations and distributions to the Affiliates managers. As a result, the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the Owners Allocation allocated to the Affiliates managers until that portion is eliminated, before reducing the portion allocated to us. Any such reduction in our portion of the Owners Allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future Owners Allocation allocated to the Affiliates managers. Nevertheless, we may agree to adjustments to revenue sharing arrangements to accommodate our business needs or those of our Affiliates if we believe that doing so will maximize the long term benefits to us. In addition, a revenue sharing arrangement may be modified to a profit based arrangement (as described below) to better accommodate our business needs or those of our Affiliates. Certain of our Affiliates operate under profit based arrangements through which we receive a share of profits as cash flow. As a result, we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms. In these cases, we participate in a budgeting process and generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the Affiliate. In recent periods, approximately 15% of our earnings has been generated through our profit based arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $266.5 million was reported as compensation to our Affiliate managers under these revenue sharing arrangements. Additionally, during this period we allocated approximately $212.5 million of our Affiliates profits to their managers (referred to in our Consolidated Statements of Income as Minority interest). Our Net Income reflects the revenue of our consolidated Affiliates and our share of income from Affiliates which we account for under the equity method, reduced by: the operating expenses of our consolidated Affiliates; our operating expenses (i.e., our holding company expenses, including interest, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and compensation for our employees); and the profits allocated to managers of our consolidated Affiliates (i.e., minority interest). As discussed above, for consolidated Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, the operating expenses of the Affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase (or decrease) as the Affiliates revenue increases (or decreases) because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the Affiliates revenue and its Operating Allocation and Owners Allocation. At our consolidated profit based Affiliates, expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the Affiliates revenues. Our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including: those affecting the global financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly, which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our Affiliates; the level of Affiliate revenue, which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future Affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures, marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results; our receipt of Owners Allocation from Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, which depends on the ability of our existing and future Affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins; 22 the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of Affiliates that operate on a profit based model; the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments; our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed; the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments; the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations, including compensation for our employees; and the level of taxation to which we are subject. Through our affiliated investment management firms, we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services. Investment management fees (asset based fees) are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a clients assets under management; most asset based advisory fees are billed by our Affiliates quarterly. Certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period (in advance). Other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period (in arrears). Most client accounts in the High Net Worth distribution channel are billed in advance, and most client accounts in the Institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears. Clients in the Mutual Fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management. Advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period but may reflect changes due to client withdrawals. Conversely, advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period. In addition to generating asset based fees, over 30 Affiliate products, representing approximately $28 billion of assets under management, also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance (performance fees). These products, which are primarily in the Institutional distribution channel, are generally structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and, if earned, the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than an asset based fee. Although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue. We also anticipate that, within any calendar year, the majority of performance fees will typically be realized in the fourth quarter. For certain of our Affiliates, generally where we own a minority interest, we are required to use the equity method of accounting. Consistent with this method, we have not consolidated the operating results of these firms (including their revenue) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our share of these firms profits (net of intangible amortization) is reported in Income from equity method investments, and is therefore reflected in our Net Income and EBITDA. As a consequence, increases or decreases in these firms assets under management (which totaled $46.1 billion as of December 31, 2006) will not affect reported revenue in the same manner as changes in assets under management at our other Affiliates. Results of Operations The following tables present our Affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment (which are also referred to as distribution channels in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). 23 Assets under Management Statement of Changes (in billions) Mutual Fund Institutional High Net Worth Total December 31, 2003 $ 25.4 $ 43.2 $ 22.9 $ 91.5 Net client cash flows 2.0 1.6 (4.4 ) (0.8 ) New investments(1) 0.4 24.8 25.2 Investment performance 6.1 6.5 1.3 13.9 December 31, 2004 33.9 76.1 19.8 129.8 Net client cash flows 4.1 8.7 (2.0 ) 10.8 New investments(1) 6.9 15.0 6.1 28.0 Other Affiliate transactions(2) (3.6 ) (3.6 ) Investment performance 5.4 13.1 0.8 19.3 December 31, 2005 50.3 109.3 24.7 184.3 Net client cash flows 0.4 18.5 0.5 19.4 New investments(1) 0.6 11.1 0.2 11.9 Other Affiliate transactions(2) (0.3 ) (0.6 ) (0.9 ) Investment performance 6.9 16.1 3.4 26.4 December 31, 2006 $ 58.2 $ 154.7 $ 28.2 $ 241.1 (1) In 2004, we completed new Affiliate investments in Genesis Fund Managers, LLP, TimesSquare Capital Management, LLC and AQR Capital Management, LLC. Additionally, in 2004, we acquired the retail mutual fund business of Conseco Capital Management, Inc. through Managers Investment Group LLC. In 2005, we acquired the mutual fund business of Fremont Investment Advisors Inc. through Managers Investment Group LLC and completed new Affiliate investments in Foyston, Gordon & Payne Inc.; Beutel, Goodman & Company Ltd.; Montrusco Bolton Investments Inc.; Deans Knight Capital Management Ltd.; Triax Capital Corporation; and Covington Capital Corporation. In December 2006, we completed a new Affiliate investment in Chicago Equity Partners. (2) In 2005 and 2006, we transferred our interests in certain affiliated investment management firms. These transactions were not material to our financial position or results of operations. The operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management. For the Mutual Fund distribution channel, average assets under management represents an average of the daily net assets under management. For the Institutional and High Net Worth distribution channels, average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period. We believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and, as such, provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue. 24 2004 2005 % Change 2006 % Change (in millions, except as noted) Average Assets under Management (in billions)(1) Mutual Fund $ 27.8 $ 43.0 55 % $ 54.4 27 % Institutional 51.8 88.8 71 % 125.1 41 % High Net Worth 21.3 20.9 (2 )% 26.8 28 % Total $ 100.9 $ 152.7 51 % $ 206.3 35 % Revenue(2)(3) Mutual Fund $ 261.9 $ 400.9 53 % $ 501.7 25 % Institutional 262.3 385.7 47 % 514.8 33 % High Net Worth 135.8 129.9 (4 )% 153.9 18 % Total $ 660.0 $ 916.5 39 % $ 1,170.4 28 % Net Income(2) Mutual Fund $ 37.8 $ 56.8 50 % $ 68.0 20 % Institutional 26.9 51.3 91 % 65.8 28 % High Net Worth 12.4 11.0 (11 )% 17.5 59 % Total $ 77.1 $ 119.1 54 % $ 151.3 27 % EBITDA(2)(3) Mutual Fund $ 78.7 $ 110.3 40 % $ 138.2 25 % Institutional 71.5 125.2 75 % 162.3 30 % High Net Worth 36.2 32.0 (12 )% 41.6 30 % Total $ 186.4 $ 267.5 44 % $ 342.1 28 % (1) Assets under management attributable to investments that were completed during the relevant periods are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment. Average assets under management includes assets managed by affiliated investment management firms that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes of $1.6 billion, $20.6 billion and $39.1 for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. (2) Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain investments and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes. Our share of profits from these investments is reported in Income from equity method investments and is therefore reflected in Net Income and EBITDA. (3) The definition of EBITDA and our reasons for using EBITDA are presented in Note 4 on page 2. Our use of EBITDA, including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations, is discussed in greater detail in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 25 Revenue Our revenue is generally determined by the level of our assets under management, the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments, which realize different fee rates, and the recognition of any performance fees. Our revenue increased $253.9 million (or 28%) in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of a 35% increase in average assets under management. The increase in assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance and net client cash flows and, to a lesser extent, our 2005 investments in new Affiliates. The increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these Affiliates. The increase in revenue of $256.5 million (or 39%) in 2005 from 2004 resulted principally from a 51% increase in average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to our investments in new Affiliates in 2004 and 2005 and, to a lesser extent, positive investment performance and cash flows. The increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these Affiliates. Unrelated to the change in assets under management, the increase in revenue was also a result of higher performance fees in 2005 as compared to 2004. The following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments. Mutual Fund Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $100.8 million (or 25%) in the Mutual Fund distribution channel in 2006 from 2005 resulted principally from a 27% increase in average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance, our 2005 investments in new Affiliates, and positive net client cash flows. The increase in revenue of $139.0 million (or 53%) in 2005 from 2004 resulted principally from a 55% increase in average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to positive investment performance and net client cash flows, and, to a lesser extent, from investments in new Affiliates. Institutional Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $129.1 million (or 33%) in the Institutional distribution channel in 2006 from 2005 resulted principally from a 41% increase in average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance and net client cash flows and, to a lesser extent, our 2005 investments in new Affiliates. The increase in revenue was proportionately less than the increase in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate revenue or expenses of such Affiliates. Our revenue increased $123.4 million (or 47%) in 2005 from 2004, primarily as a result of a 71% increase in average assets under management. The increase in assets under management resulted principally from our investments in new Affiliates in 2004 and 2005, and to a lesser extent, from positive investment performance and net client cash flows. The increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these Affiliates. Unrelated to the change in assets under management, the increase in revenue was also a result of higher performance fees in 2005 as compared to 2004. 26 High Net Worth Distribution Channel The increase in revenue of $24.0 million (or 18%) in the High Net Worth distribution channel in 2006 from 2005 resulted principally from a 28% increase in average assets under management. The increase in average assets under management resulted principally from our 2005 investments in new Affiliates and positive investment performance. The increase in revenue was proportionately less than the increase in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these Affiliates, and increases in assets under management that realize a comparatively lower fee rate. Revenue decreased $5.9 million (or 4%) in 2005 from 2004 in the High Net Worth distribution channel, principally from a 2% decline in average assets under management. The decline in average assets under management was primarily attributable to net client cash outflows at Rorer Asset Management, LLC and was substantially offset by investments in new Affiliates and positive investment performance. The change in revenue was proportionately less than the change in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments, as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these Affiliates. Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses: 2004 2005 % Change 2006 % Change (in millions) Compensation and related expenses $ 241.6 $ 365.9 51 % $ 472.4 29 % Selling, general and administrative 109.1 162.1 49 % 184.0 14 % Amortization of intangible assets 18.3 24.9 36 % 27.4 10 % Depreciation and other amortization 6.4 7.0 9 % 8.7 24 % Other operating expenses 16.7 21.5 29 % 23.9 11 % Total operating expenses $ 392.1 $ 581.4 48 % $ 716.4 23 % The substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our Affiliates, the majority of which is incurred by Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements. For Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, an Affiliates Operating Allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses. Accordingly, our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each Affiliates revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective Operating Allocations. During 2006, approximately $266.5 million, or about 56% of our consolidated compensation expense, was attributable to our Affiliate managers. The percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one Affiliate to another and may vary within an Affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue. As a result, changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree. Compensation and related expenses increased 29% in 2006, following a 51% increase in 2005. The increase in 2006 was primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, which experienced aggregate increases in revenue and accordingly, reported higher compensation expenses, including $12.8 million of additional compensation expense from our new investments in 2005 (and the inclusion of the compensation expense for those Affiliates). The increase in 2005 was also primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our Affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements, which experienced aggregate increases in revenue, and accordingly, reported higher compensation expenses, including $52.0 million in additional compensation expenses from our new investments in 2004 and 2005 (and the inclusion of the compensation expense for those Affiliates). This increase was also related to a $16.9 million increase in 27 holding company compensation (relating to equity based and incentive compensation, as well as increases in the number of holding company personnel), with the remainder associated with our formation of Managers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14% in 2006. The increase was principally attributable to the growth in assets under management at our Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel, including the $6.9 billion of assets under management from our 2005 investments in new Affiliates. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 49% in 2005. The increase was principally attributable to increases in expenses that resulted from the growth in assets under management at our Affiliates in the Mutual Fund distribution channel, and the $20.1 million increase in additional Affiliate expenses from our new investments in 2004 and 2005 (and the inclusion of the additional expenses for those Affiliates). Amortization of intangible assets increased 10% in 2006 and 36% in 2005, principally from an increase in definite lived intangible assets resulting from our investments in new and existing Affiliates during 2005. Depreciation and other amortization expenses increased 24% in 2006 and 9% in 2005. The increase in 2006 was principally attributable to our 2005 investments in new Affiliates and other spending on depreciable assets during 2005 and 2006. In 2005, the increase was principally attributable to new investments. Other operating expenses increased 11% in 2006 principally as a result of a $1.1 million increase in operating expenses from our new investments in 2005 and expenses related to other Affiliate transactions. Other operating expenses increased 29% in 2005, principally as a result of a $2.7 million increase in operating expenses from our new investments in 2004 and 2005 (and the inclusion of the additional expenses for those Affiliates). Other Income Statement Data The following table summarizes non operating income and expense data: 2004 2005 % Change 2006 % Change (in millions) Income from equity method investments $ 1.3 $ 27.0 1,977 % $ 38.3 42 % Investment and other income 6.9 8.9 29 % 16.9 90 % Investment income from Affiliate investments in partnerships 0.3 0.4 33 % 3.4 750 % Minority interest in Affiliate investments in partnerships 3.4 Minority interest 115.5 144.3 25 % 212.5 47 % Interest expense 31.7 37.4 18 % 58.8 57 % Income tax expense 51.9 70.6 36 % 86.6 23 % Income from equity method investments consists of our share of income from Affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, net of any related intangible amortization. Income from equity method investments increased 42% in 2006 as a result of an increase in assets under management, including our 2005 investments in new Affiliates ($5.7 million increase in income in 2006). The increase in 2005 was attributable to new investments in Affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investment and other income primarily consists of earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances and earnings that Affiliates realize on investments in marketable securities. Investment and other income 28 increased 90% in 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in Affiliate investment earnings of $6.4 million, and earnings of $1.6 million on investments held by new Affiliates. Our agreements generally allocate Affiliate earnings on marketable securities to our management partners. The increase in 2005 was attributable to a $1.5 million increase in aggregate Affiliate investment income from our new investments in 2004 and 2005 (and the inclusion of the investment income for those Affiliates). In 2005, the increase in investment and other income resulting from the non recurrence of a $2.5 million loss in 2004 on our repurchase of $154.3 million of the senior notes component of our 2001 PRIDES was partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in interest income. In 2006 we adopted EITF 04 05, which requires us to consolidate certain Affiliate investment partnerships in our financial statements. Investment income from Affiliate investments in partnerships and Minority interest in Affiliate investments in partnerships results from the consolidation of these partnerships. For 2006, the income from Affiliate investments in partnerships was $3.4 million, which was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us and is reported as Minority interest in Affiliate investments in partnerships. Minority interest increased 47% in 2006, principally as a result of the previously discussed increase in revenue. This increase was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because certain Affiliates reported expenses that were less than their Operating Allocation. Minority interest increased 25% in 2005, principally as a result of the previously discussed increase in revenue. The percentage increase in minority interest was proportionately less than the percentage increase in revenue because of $9.0 million in investment spending by certain Affiliates in 2005 and our November 2004 purchase of an additional 19% interest in Friess Associates, which decreased minority interest by $9.4 million. Interest expense increased 57% in 2006, principally attributable to the April 2006 issuance of $300 million of junior convertible trust preferred securities ($11.4 million in 2006) and increases in borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility ($7.2 million in 2006). The increase in 2005 was principally attributable to our floating rate convertible securities ($5.6 million), borrowings under our credit facility ($5.0 million) and our 2004 PRIDES ($1.4 million). Income taxes increased 23% in 2006 principally as a result of the 25% increase in net income before taxes. The increase was partially offset by a $1.4 million reduction in income taxes from a decrease in Canadian federal income tax rates. The 36% increase in income tax expense in 2005 was principally attributable to an increase in income before taxes and was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 40.2% to 37.2%. Net Income The following table summarizes Net Income for the past three years: 2004 2005 % Change 2006 % Change (in millions) Net Income $ 77.1 $ 119.1 54 % $ 151.3 27 % Net Income increased 27% in 2006 and 54% in 2005, principally as a result of increases in revenue and income from equity method investments, partially offset by increases in reported operating, interest, minority interest and tax expenses, as described above. Supplemental Performance Measure As supplemental information, we provide a non GAAP performance measure that we refer to as Cash Net Income. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net Income. Cash Net Income is defined as Net Income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets plus 29 Affiliate depreciation. We consider Cash Net Income an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our Affiliates. Cash Net Income is used by our management and Board of Directors as a principal performance benchmark, including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. Since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by us, and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse, we add back these non cash expenses to Net Income to measure operating performance. We add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back, because these accruals would be used only in the event of a future sale of an Affiliate or an impairment charge, which we consider unlikely. We add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our Affiliates because under our Affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets. Conversely, we do not add back the deferred taxes relating to our floating rate senior convertible securities or other depreciation expenses. The following table provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Cash Net Income: 2004 2005 2006 (in millions) Net Income $ 77.1 $ 119.1 $ 151.3 Intangible amortization 18.3 24.9 27.4 Intangible amortization equity method investments(1) 0.9 8.5 9.3 Intangible related deferred taxes 25.8 28.8 28.8 Affiliate depreciation 4.4 4.8 5.7 Cash Net Income $ 126.5 $ 186.1 $ 222.5 (1) As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to use the equity method of accounting for our investments in AQR, Beutel and Deans Knight and, as such, do not consolidate their revenue or expenses (including intangible amortization expenses) in our income statement. Our share of these investments amortization is reported in Investment and other income. Cash Net Income increased 20% in 2006 and 47% in 2005, primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting Net Income. 30 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources: December 31, 2004 2005 2006 (in millions) Balance Sheet Data Cash and cash equivalents $ 140.3 $ 140.4 $ 201.7 Short term investments 21.2 Senior debt 126.8 241.3 365.5 Zero coupon convertible notes 124.0 124.2 113.4 Floating rate convertible securities 300.0 300.0 300.0 Mandatory convertible securities 300.0 300.0 300.0 Junior convertible trust preferred securities 300.0 Cash Flow Data Operating cash flows $ 177.9 $ 204.1 $ 301.0 Investing cash flows (478.3 ) (82.0 ) (165.1 ) Financing cash flows 215.2 (122.3 ) (75.1 ) EBITDA(1) 186.4 267.5 342.1 (1) The definition of EBITDA is presented in Note 4 on page 2. We view our ratio of debt to EBITDA (our leverage ratio) as an important gauge of our ability to service debt, make new investments and access capital. Consistent with industry practice, we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities or our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio. We also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting our cash and cash equivalents from our debt balance. The leverage covenant of our senior revolving credit facility is generally consistent with our treatment of our mandatory convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities and our net debt approach. As of December 31, 2006, our leverage ratio was 1.7:1. Supplemental Liquidity Measure As supplemental information, we provide information regarding our EBITDA, a non GAAP liquidity measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, cash flow from operations. EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA, as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA by other companies. As a measure of liquidity, we believe that EBITDA is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt, make new investments and meet working capital requirements. We further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry. 31 The following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to EBITDA: 2004 2005 2006 (in millions) Cash Flow from Operations $ 177.9 $ 204.1 $ 301.0 Interest expense, net of non cash items(1) 26.9 32.5 53.6 Current tax provision 20.3 38.9 55.2 Income from equity method investments, net of distributions(2) 2.2 18.9 1.6 Changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments (40.9 ) (26.9 ) (69.3 ) EBITDA(3) $ 186.4 $ 267.5 $ 342.1 (1) Non cash items represent amortization of issuance costs and interest accretion ($4.8, $4.9 and $5.2 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively). (2) Distributions from equity method investments were $0, $16.6 and $46.0 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. (3) The definition of EBITDA is presented in Note 4 on page 2. In 2006, we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities, the issuance of convertible securities and borrowings of senior debt. Our principal uses of cash were to repurchase shares of our common stock, make investments in new and existing Affiliates, repay senior debt and make distributions to Affiliate managers. We expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing Affiliates, distributions to Affiliate managers, payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt, the repurchase of debt securities, the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes. Senior Revolving Credit Facility We entered into an amended and restated senior revolving credit facility (the Facility) in February 2007, which allows us to borrow up to $650 million at rates of interest (based either on the Eurodollar rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time) that vary depending on our credit ratings. Subject to the agreement of the lenders (or prospective lenders) to increase their commitments, we have the option to borrow up to an aggregate of $800 million under this Facility. The Facility will mature in February 2012, and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage. The Facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, cash dividends and fundamental corporate changes. Borrowings under the Facility are collateralized by pledges of the substantial majority of our capital stock or other equity interests owned by us. As of December 31, 2006, we had $365.5 million outstanding under our prior Facility. Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Notes In May 2001, we issued $251 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due 2021 (zero coupon convertible notes), with each note issued at 90.50% of such principal amount and accreting at a rate of 0.50% per year. Following the repurchase and conversion of $129.2 million principal amount of such notes, $121.8 million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible notes remains outstanding. Each security is convertible into 17.429 shares of our common stock (at a current base conversion price of $53.34) upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following: (i) if the closing price of a share of our common stock is more than a specified price over certain periods (initially $62.36 and increasing incrementally at the end of each calendar quarter to $63.08 in April 2021); (ii) if the credit rating assigned by Standard & Poors to the securities is below BB ; or (iii) if we call the securities for redemption. The holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value in May, 2011 and 2016. If the holders exercise this option in the future, we may elect to 32 repurchase the securities with cash, shares of our common stock or some combination thereof. We have the option to redeem the securities for cash at their accreted value. Under the terms of the indenture governing the zero coupon convertible notes, a holder may convert such security into common stock by following the conversion procedures in the indenture; subject to changes in the price of our common stock, the zero coupon convertible notes may not be convertible in certain future periods. In February 2006, we amended the zero coupon convertible notes. Under the terms of this amendment, we will pay interest through May 7, 2008 at a rate of 0.375% per year on the principal amount at maturity of the notes in addition to the accrual of the original issue discount. Floating Rate Senior Convertible Securities In February 2003, we issued $300 million of floating rate senior convertible securities due 2033 (floating rate convertible securities). The floating rate convertible securities bear interest at a rate equal to 3 month LIBOR minus 0.50%, payable in cash quarterly. Each security is convertible into shares of our common stock (at a base conversion price of $54.17) upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following: (i) if the closing price of a share of our common stock exceeds $65.00 over certain periods; (ii) if the credit rating assigned by Standard & Poors is below BB ; or (iii) if we call the securities for redemption. Upon conversion, holders of the securities will receive 18.462 shares of our common stock for each convertible security. In addition, if the market price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price at the time of conversion, holders will receive additional shares of common stock based on the stock price at that time. Based on the trading price of our common stock as of December 31, 2006, upon conversion a holder of each security would receive an additional 5.453 shares. The holders of the floating rate convertible securities may require us to repurchase such securities in February 2008, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, at their principal amount. We may choose to pay the purchase price for such repurchases with cash, shares of our common stock or some combination thereof. We may redeem the convertible securities for cash at any time on or after February 25, 2008, at their principal amount. Under the terms of the indenture governing the floating rate convertible securities, a holder may convert such security into common stock by following the conversion procedures in the indenture; subject to changes in the price of our common stock, the floating rate convertible securities may not be convertible in certain future periods. As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively exchange the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate on $150 million of the floating rate convertible securities. Through February 2008, we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 3.28% on that notional amount. The floating rate senior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations. These regulations require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense, and results in annual deferred tax liabilities of $3.9 million. These deferred tax liabilities will not reverse if our common stock is trading above certain thresholds at the time of the securities conversion. For example, if the securities converted on February 22, 2007, all of the related deferred taxes would have been reclassified to equity if our common stock was trading at, or above, $60.90. As of February 22, 2007, the closing price of our common stock was $117.41 per share. 2004 Mandatory Convertible Securities In February 2004, we issued $300 million of mandatory convertible securities (2004 PRIDES). As described below, these securities are structured to provide $300 million of additional proceeds to us following a successful remarketing and the exercise of forward purchase contracts in February 2008. Each unit of the 2004 PRIDES consists of (i) a senior note due February 2010 with a principal amount of $1,000 per note, on which we pay interest quarterly at the annual rate of 4.125%, and (ii) a forward 33 purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase shares of our common stock in February 2008. Holders of the purchase contracts receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment at the annual rate of 2.525% per $1,000 purchase contract. The current portion of the contract adjustment payments, approximately $6.0 million, is recorded in current liabilities. The number of shares to be issued in February 2008 will be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date. Depending on the average trading price in that period, the settlement rate will range from 11.785 to 18.031 shares per $1,000 purchase contract. Based on the trading price of our common stock as of December 31, 2006, the purchase contracts would have a settlement rate of 12.990. Each of the senior notes is pledged to us to collateralize the holders obligations under the forward purchase contracts. Under the terms of the 2004 PRIDES, the senior notes are expected to be remarketed to new investors. A successful remarketing will generate $300 million of gross proceeds to be used by the original holders of the 2004 PRIDES to fulfill their obligations on the forward purchase contracts. In exchange for the additional $300 million payment on the forward purchase contracts, we will issue shares of our common stock to the original holders of the senior notes. As referenced above, the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be determined by the market price of our common stock at that time. Assuming a successful remarketing, the senior notes will remain outstanding until at least February 2010. Junior Convertible Trust Preferred Securities In April 2006, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2036 to a wholly owned trust simultaneous with the issuance, by the trust, of $291 million of convertible trust preferred securities to investors. Under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the trust is not consolidated in our financial statements. The junior subordinated convertible debentures and convertible trust preferred securities (together, the junior convertible trust preferred securities) have substantially the same terms. The junior convertible trust preferred securities bear interest at 5.1% per annum, payable in cash quarterly. Each $50 security is convertible, at any time, into 0.333 shares of our common stock, which represents a conversion price of $150 per share. Upon conversion, investors will receive cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and common stock) at our election. The junior convertible trust preferred securities may not be redeemed by us prior to April 15, 2011. On or after April 15, 2011, the junior convertible trust preferred securities may be redeemed if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $195 for a specified period of time. The trusts only assets are the junior convertible subordinated debentures. To the extent the trust has available funds, we are obligated to ensure that holders of the convertible trust preferred securities receive all payments due from the trust. The junior convertible trust preferred securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under the federal income tax regulations. As with our floating rate convertible securities, we are required to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense. These deductions generate deferred taxes of approximately $2.6 million per year. Call Spread Option Agreements In March 2006, we entered into a series of call spread option agreements with a major securities firm. The agreements provide us the option, but not the obligation, to repurchase up to 917,000 shares of our common stock, beginning in June 2007 and ending in December 2007, at a weighted average price of $99.59 per share. If our prevailing share price exceeds $132.74, on a weighted average basis during this period, the net number of shares available for repurchase under the agreements will be less than 917,000. 34 In the event we elect to exercise our option, we may elect to receive cash proceeds rather than shares of common stock. In connection with this arrangement, we made payments of approximately $13.3 million, which were recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity. Purchases of Affiliate Equity Many of our Affiliate operating agreements provide our Affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals. These agreements also provide us a conditional right to require Affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death, permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide Affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events. These purchases may occur in varying amounts over a period of approximately 15 years (or longer), and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases (or the actual occurrence of such purchases) generally cannot be predicted with any certainty. These purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the Affiliates cash flow distributions at the time the right is exercised, which is intended to represent fair value. As one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases, in the event that a triggering event and resulting purchase occurred with respect to all such retained equity interests as of December 31, 2006, the aggregate amount of these payments would have totaled approximately $1,324.8 million. In the event that all such transactions were consummated, we would own the cash flow distributions attributable to the additional equity interests purchased from our Affiliate managers. As of December 31, 2006, this amount would represent approximately $170.4 million on an annualized basis. We may pay for these purchases in cash, shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration. Affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases, subject to our approval or other restrictions. These potential purchases, combined with our other cash needs, may require more cash than is available from operations, and therefore, we may need to raise capital by making borrowings under our Facility, by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities, or to otherwise refinance a portion of these purchases. Operating Cash Flow Cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges and changes from our consolidated working capital. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2006 and 2005 resulted principally from increases in net income and distributions from our equity method affiliates. In 2006, in accordance with EITF 04 05, we consolidated $108.4 million of client assets held in partnerships controlled by our Affiliates. Purchases and sales of these client assets generated $7.7 million of operating cash flow in 2006. This operating cash flow was offset by a corresponding financing cash flow to the minority partners. Investing Cash Flow Changes in net cash flow from investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing Affiliates. Net cash flow used to make investments was $474.1 million, $85.2 million and $123.3 million for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2004, we acquired interests in Genesis, TimesSquare and AQR, and additional interests in existing Affiliates. In 2005, we acquired interests in a group of Canadian Affiliates, as well as additional equity interests in existing Affiliates. In 2006, we acquired an interest in Chicago Equity Partners, LLC, as well as additional equity interests in existing Affiliates. In conjunction with certain acquisitions, we have entered into agreements and are contingently liable, upon achievement of specified financial targets, to make additional purchase payments of up to $165 million through 2011. The specified financial targets for certain agreements will be measured 35 beginning December 31, 2007. In the event the first financial target is achieved, we will make a payment of up to $50 million in 2008. Financing Cash Flow Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased $47.2 million in 2006 from 2005, primarily as a result of $536.5 million of repurchases of our common stock, a use of cash that was financed by our $300 million issuance of junior convertible trust preferred securities and a net increase of borrowings under our facility. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), beginning in 2006, certain tax benefits associated with stock options ($23.0 million) have been reported as financing cash flows. The change in net cash flow from financing activities in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to the repayment of $150.8 million of debt at AMG Canada in connection with our 2005 investment, as well as the net effect of higher common stock repurchases relative to issuances of common stock. This increase was partially offset by $124.5 million of net borrowings under our Facility. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (in millions) Senior debt(1) $ 365.5 $ $ $ 365.5 $ Senior convertible debt(1) 428.1 5.4 0.9 421.8 Mandatory convertible securities(1)(2) 347.5 20.0 25.8 301.7 Junior convertible trust preferred securities(1)(2) 748.2 15.3 30.6 30.6 671.7 Purchases of Affiliate equity(3) 1,324.8 121.6 529.4 259.2 414.6 Leases 114.5 18.7 35.6 27.0 33.2 Other liabilities(4) 42.4 41.1 1.3 Total $ 3,371.0 $ 222.1 $623.6 $ 984.0 $1,541.3 (1) The timing of debt payments assumes that outstanding debt is settled for cash or common stock at the applicable maturity dates. The amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest. (2) As more fully discussed on page 31, consistent with industry practice, we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities or our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio. (3) Purchases of Affiliate equity reflect our estimates of conditional purchases of additional equity in our Affiliates and assume that all conditions to such purchases are met and that such purchases will all be effected on the date that they are first exercisable. As described previously, these purchases may occur in varying amounts over the next 15 years (or longer), and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases (or the actual occurrence of such purchases) generally cannot be predicted with any certainty. Additionally, in many instances we have the discretion to settle these purchases with our common stock and in all cases can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities. As one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases, assuming that all such purchases had been effected as of December 31, 2006, the aggregate purchase amount would have totaled approximately $1,324.8 million. Assuming the closing of such additional purchases, we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased, estimated to be approximately $170.4 million on an annualized basis as of December 31, 2006. (4) Other liabilities reflect amounts payable to Affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional Affiliate equity interests. 36 Interest Rate Sensitivity Our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed. Such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are, in part, affected by changing interest rates. We cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our Affiliates assets under management and associated fees. We pay a variable rate of interest on our senior revolving credit facility ($365.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2006) and on $150 million of our floating rate senior convertible securities. Based on these variable rate borrowings, we estimate that a 100 basis point (1%) change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of approximately $5.2 million. We have fixed rates of interest on the senior notes component of our 2004 PRIDES, our zero coupon senior convertible notes and our junior convertible trust preferred securities. While a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on these securities, such a change may affect the fair value of these securities. We estimate that a 100 basis point (1%) change in interest rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in a net change in the fair value of our securities of approximately $6.0 million at December 31, 2006. Market Risk Our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management. Declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income. From time to time, we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. As of December 31, 2006, we were a party, with three major commercial banks as counterparties, to $150 million notional amount interest rate swap contracts which fix the interest rate on a portion of our floating rate senior convertible securities to a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.28% for the period from February 2005 to February 2008. The unrealized gain on these interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2006 was $2.4 million. We estimate that a 100 basis point (1%) change in interest rates as of December 31, 2006 would result in a net change in the unrealized value of approximately $1.8 million. There can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness. We operate primarily in the United States, and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. We also provide services and earn revenue outside of the United States; therefore, the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates. The valuations of our foreign Affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which could be recorded as a component of Stockholders equity. To illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates, as of December 31, 2006, we estimate that a 1% change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would result in a change to Stockholders equity of approximately $3.0 million. 37 Recent Accounting Developments In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. FIN 48 provides a comprehensive model for the accounting and disclosure of uncertain income tax return positions. We have completed our initial evaluation of the impact of FIN 48 and believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which will become effective in the first quarter of 2008. FAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value. We are in the process of evaluating the potential future effect of FAS 157 on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We can elect to adopt the provisions of FAS 159 either in the first quarter of 2007 or the first quarter of 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the potential future effect of FAS 159 on our financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting estimates and judgments. These policies are affected significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Valuation In allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our assets for impairment, we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships, operating segments, and equity method investments. We also assess the value of minority interests held by our Affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer. In these valuations, we make assumptions of the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts. Additionally, we make assumptions of, among other factors, projected future earnings and cash flow, valuation multiples, tax benefits and discount rates. In certain instances, we engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations. The impact of many of these assumptions are material to our financial condition and operating performance and, at times, are subjective. If we used different assumptions, the carrying value of our equity method investments, our intangible assets and the related amortization could be stated differently and our impairment conclusions could be modified. Additionally, the use of different assumptions to value our minority interests could change the amount of compensation expense, if any, we report upon their transfer. 38 Intangible Assets At December 31, 2006, the carrying amounts of our intangible asset balances are as follows: (in millions) Definite lived acquired client relationships $ 243.3 Indefinite lived acquired client relationships 258.8 Goodwill 1,177.2 These amounts exclude $86.3 million of definite lived acquired client relationships, and $185.3 million of goodwill that are reported within Equity investments in Affiliates. We amortize our definite lived acquired client relationships over their expected useful lives. We reassess these lives each quarter based on historical and projected attrition rates and other events and circumstances that may influence the expected future economic benefit we will derive from the relationships. Significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the amount of our amortization expense. For example, if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year, our amortization expense would increase by approximately $2.4 million per year. We assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying value to their projected undiscounted cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we performed our most recent annual impairment test, and no impairments were identified. We do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely. Each quarter, we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life. We test the carrying amount of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships at least annually, or at such time that we conclude the assets no longer have an indefinite life by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value. We derive the fair value of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis. Our valuation analysis reflects assumptions of the growth of the assets, discount rates and other factors. Changes in the estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the impairment conclusion. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairments were identified. We test the carrying amount of the goodwill in each of our three operating segments at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to an estimate of fair value. We establish the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples. Changes in the estimates used in this test could materially affect our impairment conclusion. In the third quarter of 2006, we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairment was identified. Equity Method Investments We account for certain of our Affiliate investments under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, we evaluate these investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period considered to be other than temporary. Additionally, we would consider the magnitude of any decline in market value and the expected holding period of the investment. If we determine that a decline in market value below our carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed our evaluation of investments accounted for under the equity method and no impairment was identified. 39 Deferred Taxes Our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and from our convertible securities. As more fully described below, we generally believe that our intangible related deferred taxes are unlikely to reverse, and believe that the deferred tax liabilities for our floating rate convertible securities and the junior convertible trust preferred securities may not reverse. As such, we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these sources will be permanent. Most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our Affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers. Intangible assets associated with our 2005 investment in AMG Canada, however, are not deductible for tax purposes. We record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes, but do amortize for tax purposes, thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes. These liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an Affiliate or an impairment charge, events we consider unlikely to occur. Under current accounting rules, we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability. As of December 31, 2006, our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment charge was approximately $170.2 million. As discussed above, our floating rate convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities generate deferred tax liabilities ($6.5 million annually) because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense. We believe that some or all of these deferred tax liabilities will be reclassified to equity as the securities are likely to convert to common stock when our stock price exceeds specified levels. If the floating rate convertible securities had converted on February 22, 2007, all of the deferred liabilities ($13.7 million as of December 31, 2006) would be reclassified to equity if our stock price was at, or above, $60.90 per share. As of February 22, 2007, the closing price of our common stock was $117.41 per share. In addition, we also regularly assess our deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of state tax loss carryforwards, in order to determine the need for valuation allowances. In our assessment we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets, which have limited lives. If we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset, we would establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination. As of December 31, 2006, we had a valuation allowance for all state tax loss carryforwards. Changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings. For example, a 1% increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately $5.9 million in our tax expense in the period of such determination. Share Based Compensation We have share based compensation plans covering senior management, employees and directors. Prior to 2006, we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized during this period from share based compensation plans as the exercise price of all stock options granted equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award. In 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. FAS 123R requires a company to recognize share based compensation, based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Under the modified prospective method, compensation is recognized in the financial statements for all share based payments granted after that date, and for all awards that are unvested upon adoption of FAS 123R. 40 Under FAS 123R, we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options based on past experience and anticipated future trends. As an example, we considered both the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility from traded options in determining expected volatility. Our options typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to four years of continued employment and do not include performance based or market based vesting conditions. For grants that are subject to graded vesting over a service period, we recognize expense, net of expected forfeitures, on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. As of December 31, 2006, we had $28.2 million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately three years (assuming no forfeitures). Revenue Recognition The majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees (asset based and performance based). Our Affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees quarterly as they render services to their clients. In addition to generating asset based fees, over 30 Affiliate products, representing approximately $28 billion of assets under management, also bill on the basis of absolute investment performance (performance fees). These products, which are primarily in the Institutional distribution channel, are generally structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and, if earned, the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than the asset based fee. Our Affiliates recognize performance fees only when the fee becomes billable. Although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period, we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue. Economic and Market Conditions Global Asset Management Industry The asset management industry has been a key driver of growth in financial services over the last decade. According to the most recent available data, assets under management across all distribution channels globally total approximately $49.6 trillion, of which $24.7 trillion is managed in the United States. We believe prospects for overall industry growth (which have compounded at an annual rate of 9% globally over the past five years) remain strong. We expect that this growth will be driven by market related increases in assets under management, broad demographic trends and wealth creation related to growth in gross domestic product, and will be experienced in varying degrees across each of the principal distribution channels for our Affiliates products. U.S. Asset Management Industry In the Mutual Fund distribution channel, according to a 2006 industry report, more than 96 million individuals in almost 55 million households in the United States are invested in mutual funds. In 2006, net cash flows to equity mutual funds totaled over $232 billion, and aggregate mutual fund assets totaled $9.9 trillion at the end of 2006. We anticipate that inflows to mutual funds will continue and that aggregate mutual fund assets, particularly those in equity mutual funds, will continue to increase in line with long term market growth. Assets in the Institutional distribution channel in the United States are primarily in retirement plans, including both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, endowments and foundations, and totaled approximately $8.9 trillion as of June 30, 2006. Although the majority of Institutional assets are in equities 41 (estimated to be 60% in 2005), allocations to alternative investments have continued to increase. According to a recent study of institutional investors, allocations of institutional assets to hedge funds (a core component of alternative investments) have grown from 2.5% of assets in 2001 to 7.7% in 2005, and are expected to increase to 9.1% by 2007. We anticipate that the combination of an aging work force and long term market growth should contribute to the ongoing strength of this distribution channel. The High Net Worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of high net worth and affluent individuals, family trusts and managed accounts. Within this channel, high net worth families and individuals (those having at least $1 million in investable assets) in the United States had aggregate assets of $10.2 trillion at the end of 2005; industry experts expect assets in this segment of the channel to grow to $14.5 trillion by the end of 2010. We believe that affluent individuals (those having between $250,000 and $1 million in investable assets) represent an important source of asset growth within the High Net Worth channel, as the number of such individuals and the amount of investable assets increases, and the popularity of separately managed account investment products for affluent individuals continues to grow. According to a recent industry report, assets in separately managed accounts totaled approximately $805.8 billion at the end of 2006 (a nearly 25% increase over year end 2005) and are expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2011. International Operations We have international operations through Affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non US clients. In February 2007, we established a subsidiary, AMG Pty Ltd (AMG Australia) and opened an office in Sydney, Australia. Through AMG Australia, we provide client and marketing services to participating Affiliates with respect to their business interests in Australia and New Zealand. In the future, we may invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the United States. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable, different and in some cases, less stringent, regulatory and accounting regimes, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls, expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflation We do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations.
