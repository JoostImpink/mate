Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The matters discussed in the following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain forward looking statements and information relating to the Company that are based on the current beliefs and expectations of Management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us. When used in this Managements Discussion and Analysis, and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, the words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", and "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to our Company are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements reflect the current views of our Companys management, with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements. 37 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as all other related notes, and financial and operational references, appearing elsewhere in this document. Overview We are a leading Interactive media and marketing company that provides complete end to end marketing solutions for our clients who seek to increase sales and customer contact deploying the numerous facets of online marketing we offer. Our clients include advertisers, direct marketers, agencies and wireless service providers. Our online marketing offers include search engine marketing, search engine optimization, email marketing, affiliate marketing, lead generation, creative support, and development and hosting solutions. We own and operate customized websites, hosted and third party web pages, and email marketing platforms to facilitate consumer interaction with, and ultimate transactions for, our clients. We generate and record revenue primarily on a performance based model, whereby revenue is recognized upon the successful delivery of a qualifying lead, customer, survey, completed application, ultimate sale or the delivery of some other measurable marketing benefit as defined in the underlying marketing agreement. 38 In addition to generating customers, sales and leads for our advertising clients, we also use this media platform for the promotion of our own services which include subscriptions to our online personals websites and our mobile services, under which we bill consumers directly. In January of Fiscal 2005, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Hot Rocket Acquisition Corp., acquired all of the intangible assets of Hot Rocket Marketing Inc. and Clockwork Advertising Inc. (collectively Hot Rocket), corporations in the business of buying and selling performance based online advertising space for third parties, as well as providing such services to the sales activities of our consolidated entity. The Hot Rocket acquisition has broadened our reach into the Internet direct marketing arena, which continues to allow for expanded client relationships and various other synergistic possibilities, such as adding value to our core operations by the enhancement of our current and developing marketing programs conducted in our Online Advertising and Media Services activities. The initial purchase price for the Hot Rocket acquisition, recorded in Fiscal 2005, was approximately $3.8 million and was comprised of $3.1 million in cash, $0.7 million (or 113,821 shares) of our common stock and transaction fees approximating $0.1 million. Pursuant to an independent third party valuation, the reported purchase price was allocated to approximately $2.2 million of goodwill and $1.6 million of identifiable intangibles. There were no tangible assets acquired. In addition to the initial purchase price of the acquisition, we agreed to pay Hot Rocket a contingent purchase price of up to $12.5 million if Hot Rocket generates an aggregate of $27 million in EBITDA (as quantified in the Agreement) over the four year period following the closing. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, for the period February 1, 2005 to January 31, 2006, we were liable for a combined additional purchase price payment of $1.467 million, which has been settled by a cash payment of approximately $0.886 million made on May 9, 2006, and an issuance of 103,354 shares issued on May 10, 2006 (then having a fair market value of approximately $0.581 million). Future contingent payments made, if any, will be treated as additional purchase price and included as an addition to goodwill. 39 At November 30, 2006, we determined that at the current rate of growth recognized by Hot Rocket, there exists the possibility that the second anniversary tier of contingent payment will not be attained within the second measurement period, which ended January 31, 2007. Based on that lack of absolute certainty as to the second anniversary additional purchase price liability, we have not accrued any additional contingent payments at this time. Future contingencies, if any, will be recorded when the contingency has been satisfied and the additional consideration is issued or becomes issuable. The terms of the acquisition agreement also provide for additional contingent payments of purchase price for the periods February 1, 2006 through July 31, 2006, and August 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007, upon the attainment of certain EBITDA thresholds as specified in the Agreement. Hot Rocket did not reach the $1.35 million EBITDA threshold for the period ended July 31, 2006. As of November 30, 2006, based on the lack of absolute certainty regarding the EBITDA contingent threshold as it relates to the additional payment period ended January 31, 2007, we have not accrued any additional contingent payments at this time. 40 We made one asset acquisition in each of Fiscal 2004 and 2005, which accounted for approximately $6.9 million and $16.6 million of our consolidated revenues during such fiscal periods, respectively, and approximated $28.85 million, or 39.5% of consolidated revenues during the year ended November 30, 2006. Such asset acquisitions are described in further detail below and also described in the notes to the November 30, 2006 audited consolidated financial statements included herein. Background and Available Information From our inception in 1993 (under the name "Quintel Communications, Inc.") through Fiscal 1999, we generated the bulk of our revenue from direct marketing using the traditional media of television, postal mail and telemarketing. In Fiscal 2000, we repositioned our operations, focus and direct marketing business to the online media of the Web. Applying the marketing disciplines honed from our years of operating in the "off line" media arena, we have been able to provide enhanced response based results in a cost effective and scaleable manner via our online marketing strategy. During December 1995, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, which is publicly traded and is currently reported on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol TRFX. We are headquartered in Pearl River, New York and our mailing address is 1 Blue Hill Plaza, Pearl River, New York, 10965. The telephone number of our executive offices is (845) 620 1212. We have subsidiaries and branch offices in Canada. 41 Our Annual Reports on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on our website, www.traffixinc.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Any and all information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. The public may also read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

The SEC maintains an Internet site, www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our Company that we file electronically with the SEC. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the term Traffix, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Traffix Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 and fiscal years are referred to by the calendar year in which they end. For example, fiscal year 2006 and Fiscal 2006 refer to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006. 42 Online Advertising and Media Services We own and operate a variety of Internet websites featuring specialized content such as online personals, downloadable ring tones, wallpaper and music, recipes, greeting cards, automobile information, DVD promotions, and other theme based content. We generate traffic to our websites from advertising on third party Internet media (e.g., search engines, email and banner advertisements) and through cross marketing within our own online media. Our Web properties and our marketing activities utilize proprietary technologies to generate real time response based marketing results for our advertising clients. When visiting our online properties, consumers are given the opportunity to purchase, sign up for, ask to be contacted regarding, or simply indicate an interest in, hundreds of offers for various products and services. Specifically, through these interactive Web properties we generate a variety of transactional results ranging from (a) Web traffic, (b) inbound telemarketing calls, (c) outbound telemarketing leads, (d) demographically/psychographically profiled lists of consumers, (e) highly targeted customized response based leads, (f) completed applications for products, and (g) sales of our clients products and services. Online Advertising Website Advertising We own and operate a variety of websites with a broad range of content. Virtually all of our websites generate revenue from client advertisements. The advertisements are served across all of our websites using our internally developed technology that serves ads to websites using an algorithm that takes into account a number of factors including information supplied by the visitor upon registration (e.g., gender, age and zip code), as well as the price paid by our client to serve the advertisement. 43 The websites feature content ranging from music for downloads to sweepstakes. In Fiscal 2004, we launched EZ Tracks.com (a Canadian domiciled majority owned subsidiary), our music destination site that features over 30,000 songs available for free and legal downloading, as well as other content such as musical greeting cards and a downloadable version of the Bible in audio format. We have a games website that offers a variety of free parlor style games, such as backgammon and checkers. In Fiscal 2004, we also launched reciperewards.com, a website that features thousands of cooking recipes. Our PrizeDistributors, Inc. sponsored group of websites offers consumers the opportunity to win up to $1 million daily in our free, online sweepstakes. The sweepstakes prizes are indemnified by an independent, third party agency. In order to play, each consumer must provide complete and accurate registration information and agree to receive ("opt in") marketing messages from us and our marketing partners. We own and operate several other websites such as Q121, Inc., Music of Faith.com, AtlasCreditGroup.com, TheBargainSpot.com, AltasAutomotiveGroup.com, EZGreets.com, GameFiesta.com, PrizeAmerica.com and LoveFreeGames.com. Each of these sites is designed for a specific consumer interest category that we matched with client promotions that appeal to such interest category. Online Advertising Email Marketing Programs Each program that we market for our clients can be implemented not only through our websites, but also, and often, through email marketing. We currently market to a vast database, which includes consumer data that is either owned by us or is managed by us under our revenue share arrangements, whereby we recognize the gross revenue as earned and bear the payment obligation to the list owner, irrespective of receipt of payment from our clients. 44 Results Analysis Subsequent to a campaign being fully implemented, we continually analyze the marketing results to gauge whether the campaigns are generating adequate results for the client, whether the media is being utilized cost efficiently, and to determine whether new and different copy is yielding better overall results. These are traditional direct marketing disciplines that we apply and that, we believe, distinguish us from many of our competitors in the online marketing industry. Affiliate Marketing Our affiliate marketing business commenced in late Fiscal 2005 under the name of RocketProfit.com, where publishers and advertisers can make available to themselves countless unique and exclusive deals, customized promotions, high payouts, detailed tracking capabilities and significant multi level customer support. Syndication After we develop a campaign that works efficiently on our own media, we sometimes "syndicate" the program to third party media. Typically, we have expended time, media and other costs in developing certain campaigns. In exchange for this invested effort, we obtain the right to market those campaigns to other online media companies. We believe that with syndicated offers we can leverage campaigns we have developed so that in future fiscal periods we can generate additional revenue with reduced costs and risks associated with such business extension. There is no guarantee that this belief will be realized in future fiscal periods. 45 Online Advertising Internet Media Performance Based Sales Pursuant to our Fiscal 2005 acquisition of Hot Rocket Marketing, Inc., we generate revenues from the resale, on a variable performance basis, of Internet Media Advertising space acquired on a fixed cost basis. Online Advertising Data Sales, Rentals and List Management We also generate revenues from the sales, rentals and management (for use both online and offline) of our proprietary, profiled databases. Such revenue is included in our Online Advertising and Media Services activities revenue in the Online Advertising revenue line item component. Search Engine Marketing Our search engine marketing company, SendTraffic (acquired in Fiscal 2004), develops and manages search engine marketing (SEM) campaigns for our third party advertising clients, as well as for our own proprietary websites, promotions and offers. Using a proprietary technology called Marketing Dashboard, we build, manage and analyze the effectiveness of hundreds of thousands of pay per click (PPC) keywords in real time across each of the major search engines, like Google, Yahoo and MSN. SendTraffic pays the search engines directly for the traffic, and generates revenue by billing its clients the search engine costs, plus a marketing services fee. We also perform search engine optimization (SEO) services, for which advertising clients are billed a monthly retainer fee. 46 Personals Our Personals business is designed as a monthly recurring billing program, with various memberships to our Personals program, iMatchUp.com. Revenue from our Personals business is generated by directly billing consumers. In the latter part of Fiscal 2006, we began managing the declining Personals customer base, and had, and expect to continue to have a reduction in marketing efforts directed at obtaining new enrollments within the Personals program. Competition for enrollees has driven the marketing costs in excess of our tolerable thresholds. Internet Game Development Our Canadian subsidiary, Infiknowledge, ULC, performs work for hire services in the production of Internet games for third party vendors, and participates in royalties related to the development, launch and successful commercialization of such Internet games. Our expansion in, and dependence on, our online direct marketing efforts, coupled with the potential for state and or federal legislation limiting our ability to contact consumers online should all be considered when referring to our current fiscal years results, as well as prior years historical results, in evaluating the potential for our future operations, cash flows, and financial position. 47 Background In Fiscal 2000, we repositioned our operations, focus and direct marketing business to the online media of the Web. Applying the marketing disciplines honed from our years of operating in the "off line" media arena, we have been able to provide enhanced response based results in a cost effective and scaleable manner via our online marketing strategy. From our inception in 1993 (under the name "Quintel Communications, Inc.") through 1999, we generated the bulk of our revenue from using the traditional media of television, postal mail and telemarketing. During December 1995, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, which is publicly traded and is currently reported on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol TRFX. Transactions with Major Customers Transactions with major customers and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) in our discussion of Critical Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimates Discussion (immediately following {1} previously mentioned) and (3) under the heading Transactions with Major Customers in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data section hereof and incorporated herein by reference. 48 BASIS OF PRESENTATION Certain amounts for the prior periods that are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and referred to in the discussions below, have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period presentation. Segment Information We operate in one segment, Online Advertising and Media Services. In classifying the financial information for our operating activities, we rely primarily upon the evaluations of the chief operating decision maker (CODM as managed by committee) and executive management in deciding how to allocate our resources and assess our performance. Disclosure is also required about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. At December 1, 2005, management realigned the way it views operations internally and modified the format that we distribute reports and information to the CODM. In accordance with such realignment, the LEC Billed Products and Services segment, which was principally inactive in terms of its contributions to gross margin and income from operations from the period December 1, 2002 to November 30, 2005, was collapsed into our Online Advertising and Media Service activities, and was no longer displayed as a separate segment within our CODM reporting information and, therefore, was correspondingly reflected as such in our publicly disseminated financial information. For the November 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Fiscal periods, the Companys income statements and notes to the financial statements were reclassified, regarding segment disclosures and the collapse of the LEC segment into our single segment presentation of Online Advertising and Media Services Activities. All information regarding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been reclassified to conform with such presentation for all periods reported. 49 In Fiscal 2006, our Online Advertising revenue component of our Online Advertising and Media Service activities included $613,000 of legacy revenue from reserve releases from our prior LEC segment. Such reserve releases were actual cash received by us from third party service bureaus that withheld amounts from our legacy LEC segment in anticipation of bad debts; actual bad debts proved less than amounts originally withheld. At the point these monies were withheld in prior fiscal years, we had treated them as contra revenue. We do not anticipate future reserve releases, if any, will represent material amounts. We sell services and not products and, correspondingly, do not carry inventory. We had revenue from our Canadian based subsidiary of approximately $912,000 and $647,000 during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary role of the Canadian subsidiary is to support back office data operations and does not directly contribute significant amounts to consolidated net income. The majority of the Canadian subsidiarys outlays are related to the generation of our revenues. Correspondingly, we classify them within the categories of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, where appropriate. Segment information is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data section hereof. For a more detailed discussion of our segment information, also see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 50 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our net revenues, and with disclosure of our revenue components for each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, are set forth in the following tables: Net Revenue Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Year Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 Online Advertising $ 47,674,007 $ 44,177,956 $ 28,373,640 Search Engine Marketing 17,860,887 9,599,746 2,059,722 Personals 6,397,352 8,432,402 6,606,541 Internet game development 911,697 646,878 241,311 Consolidated totals $ 72,843,943 $ 62,856,982 $ 37,281,214 The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenues represented by the certain items reflected in our statement of operations: Year Ended November 30, 2006 2005 2004 Net Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Sales 65.9 % 65.3 % 59.2 % Gross Profit 34.1 % 34.7 % 40.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 29.2 % 31.7 % 40.7 % Bad debt net expense (recapture) 0.7 % 0.6 % 1.1 % Other Income 0.6 % 1.9 % 4.7 % Net income 2.6 % 3.9 % 2.7 % 51 For the Year Ended November 30, 2006 Compared to Year Ended November 30, 2005 Our net revenues, and the disclosure of our components, for each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, are set forth below: Net Revenue Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 47,674,007 $ 44,177,956 $ 3,496,051 8 % Search Engine Marketing 17,860,887 9,599,746 8,261,141 86 % Personals 6,397,352 8,432,402 (2,035,050 ) 24 % Internet game development 911,697 646,878 264,819 41 % Consolidated totals $ 72,843,943 $ 62,856,982 $ 9,986,961 16 % Net Revenue increased approximately $10 million, or 16%, to $72.8 million for the year ended November 30, 2006, from $62.9 million in the prior year. The Online Advertising and Media Services activities core business grew organically, primarily driven by increased revenues from Search Engine Marketing services (increase of $8.3 million, or 87%) and increased revenues from Online Advertising (increase of $3.5 million, or 8%). Online Advertising revenue included an increase in performance basis revenue from Internet Media Advertising (increase of $3.9 million, or 55%), and a net combined decline in revenue from our Web Advertising, Email Marketing Programs, Data sales, and list management of approximately $0.5 million, or 1.5%. Internet Game Development revenues approximated $0.9 million, for an approximate $0.3 million increase, or 41%. Search Engine Marketing service revenue increased as a result of our increased focus on our Online Advertising and Media service activities as a result of recent acquisitions. Online advertising revenue includes the revenues we generate upon our resale of Internet Media, and is also the result of recent acquisitions. The above referenced increases were offset by declines in: (a) email marketing program revenue, which declined approximately $0.2 million, or 3%, resulting from declines in the delivery rates of our email marketing offers; and (b) data sale, rental and list management revenue declines of $1.9 million, or 50%, which resulted from the shift in our business, where our increased reliance on Search Engine Marketing and Internet Advertising revenue generated lesser amounts of data that would otherwise become available for sale and rental purposes when compared to our historical incentive based online web advertising focus. 52 Our Personals business, the iMatchUp.com dating sites, recognized a revenue decline of approximately $2.0 million, or 24%, as a result of declining customer enrollments. In the latter part of Fiscal 2006 (and as expected in Fiscal 2007), we experienced (and expect to continue to experience) a reduction in marketing efforts directed at obtaining new enrollments within the Personals program. Competition for enrollees has driven the marketing costs in excess of our tolerable thresholds, which is the reasoning behind our change in our customer contact strategy and resulting revenue declines. The increase in Internet game development revenue was attributable to an increase in successful games brought to market by our development partners in Fiscal 2006 when compared to Fiscal 2005. Our cost of sales during the year ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, were comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our Online Advertising and Media Service activities marketing programs, and includes direct response email marketing costs (including related salaries, depreciation and amortization costs), website registrations costs, the cost of customer profiles, other customer acquisition costs, search engine marketing costs, and the related contingent based sweepstakes indemnification expense. 53 Our cost of sales, and the disclosure of our components, for each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, are set forth below: Cost of Sale Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Year Ended November 30, Change Inc(Dec) Change Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 28,110,977 $ 26,301,370 $ 1,809,607 7 % Search Engine Marketing 15,155,117 7,770,651 7,384,466 95 % Personals 4,432,433 6,776,885 (2,344,452 ) 35 % Internet game development 286,600 203,354 83,246 41 % Consolidated totals $ 47,985,127 $ 41,052,260 $ 6,932,867 17 % Cost of sales on a consolidated basis increased $7.0 million, or 17%, to $48.0 million for the year ended November 30, 2006, from $41 million for the year ended November 30, 2005. The significant factor contributing to the increase in consolidated costs of sales was a net increase of approximately $7.4 million, or 95%, in costs incurred in the generation of increased Search Engine Marketing service revenues. The Online Advertising component recognized a net increase in cost of sales of approximately $1.8 million, or 7%, and was comprised of increases in purchases of performance based online advertising space of $2.6 million, or 60%, as a result of a prior year acquisition within which we make direct purchases of online advertising space that is resold on a performance basis. Such increase was offset by a combined decline in website advertising registrations and total email costs of approximately $0.8 million resulting from a shift to a greater reliance on search engine marketing to drive Online Advertising traffic, coupled with an increased focus on internal email platform mailings and a lesser reliance on third party email vendors. 54 In our Personals business, costs incurred in the acquisition of new customer profiles decreased $2.3 million, or 35%. The decrease in customer profile cost correlates to our decreased emphasis on the acquisition of new enrollments during the last six months of Fiscal 2006. The cost of enrollment escalation, coupled with a decline in the billable life of existing customers, caused us to decrease our spending budget for the Personals business. We continue our focus of maximizing current customer billable lifetime. Our gross profit in terms of dollars, and our gross profit percentage, for each of the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005, are set forth below: Gross Profit Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 19,563,030 $ 17,876,586 $ 1,686,444 9 % Search Engine Marketing 2,705,770 1,829,095 876,675 48 % Personals 1,964,919 1,655,517 309,402 19 % Internet game development 625,097 443,524 181,573 41 % Consolidated totals $ 24,858,816 $ 21,804,722 $ 3,054,094 14 % 55 Gross Profit Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Absolute Change Relative Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 %%% %%% Online Advertising 41.0 % 40.5 % 0.5 % 1.4 % Search Engine Marketing 15.1 % 19.1 % 4.0 % 20.5 % Personals 30.7 % 19.6 % 11.1 % 56.4 % Internet game development 68.6 % 68.6 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Consolidated totals 34.1 % 34.7 % 0.6 % 1.6 % Consolidated Gross Profit ("gross margin") as a percentage of net revenue was 34.1% during the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to 34.7% in the prior year, representing an absolute percentage point decrease of 0.6%, or a 1.6% decrease on a relative basis. 56 The slight negative change in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to several offsetting factors. Our Personals business, the iMatchUp.com dating sites, recognized a 56.4% relative margin increase in Fiscal 2006, and is the result of reductions in our new Personals member acquisition budget and the benefit of the attritting billable customer base yielding a gross margin that was not encumbered by increasing acquisition costs (the overall impact on gross margin dollars is minimal based on the Fiscal 2006 decline in Personals revenue of approximately $2.3 million). Our Online Advertising activities gross margin remained relatively constant, resulting from the loss of a material customer in the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, partially offset by increased gross margins resulting from a greater reliance on Search Marketing in our Online Advertising efforts, which replaced the prior periods greater reliance on marginally less profitable website registrations, as well as a relative decline of 20.5% in the gross margin recognized in our Search Engine Marketing services provided to third parties. In the continued expansion of our search engine marketing services, we have recognized declines in the related gross margin as a result of maintaining such growth, coupled with cost increases arising from competitive market conditions. Our Selling Expenses for each of the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented in the table set forth below: 57 Selling Expense Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Fee share commissions $ 2,917,982 $ 2,426,527 $ 491,455 20 % Selling salaries and related costs 2,944,383 2,545,218 399,165 16 % Travel, entertainment, shows, other 220,886 261,613 (40,727 ) 16 % Consolidated totals $ 6,083,251 $ 5,233,358 $ 849,893 16 % Selling expenses, on a consolidated basis, increased approximately $0.8 million, or 16%, to $6.1 million during the year ended November 30, 2006 from $5.2 million during the year ended November 30, 2005. The increase resulted from an approximate $0.5 million increase in fee share commissions correlating to our increased use of third party databases used to generate our email marketing program revenues included in our Online Advertising revenue component. We are the primary obligor to the third party list owner and bear the responsibility of payment to the list owner regardless of whether or not our client pays us. Additionally, selling salaries and related costs increased approximately $0.4 million, or 15%, during the year ended November 30, 2006 as a result of increased sales commissions (on total revenues of $72.3 million for the year ended November 30, 2006 compared to the year ended November 30, 2005 total revenues of $62.9 million). Our general and administrative expenses ("G&A") are principally comprised of (i) compensation costs and related expenses for executive, finance, information technology and operation systems, and general administration personnel, (ii) professional fees (which include legal; audit, accounting and tax; public relations; database management and consulting; and public company related printing and filing costs), (iii) insurance costs, (iv) occupancy and other equipment rental costs, (v) salaries, depreciation and amortization related to our site development, maintenance and modification costs related to our Online Advertising and Media Services activities, and (vi) all other general and miscellaneous corporate expense items. 58 Our General and Administrative Expenses for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented in the table set forth below: General and Administrative Expense Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Compensation and related costs $ 9,251,400 $ 8,933,727 $ 317,673 4 % Professional fees 1,291,921 1,647,399 (355,478 ) 22 % Insurance costs 945,810 936,385 9,425 1 % Occupancy and equipment costs 457,206 406,261 50,945 13 % Depreciation and amortization 1,443,704 1,525,425 (81,721 ) 5 % All other miscellanous G&A expenses 1,775,240 1,245,378 529,862 43 % Consolidated totals $ 15,165,281 $ 14,694,575 $ 470,706 3 % General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") on a consolidated basis increased approximately $0.5 million, or 3%, when comparing G&A of $15.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2006 to G&A of $14.7 million incurred during the year ended November 30, 2005. The net increase was principally attributable to combined increases in compensation costs and miscellaneous G&A expenses of approximately $0.8 million, or 8%. Offset by a combined decline in professional fees, depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million. The significant increase in compensation costs was attributable to non cash stock based compensation costs of approximately $0.5 million resulting from the December 1, 2005 adoption of SFAS 123R, offset by Fiscal 2006 fourth quarter declines in contractually legislated officer bonuses based on the decline in Fiscal 2006 fourth quarter results, reducing amounts previously accrued to August 31, 2006. 59 Bad Debt Expense and (Recapture) Components Online Advertising and Media Services Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 335,565 $ (422,811 ) $ 758,376 179 % Search Engine Marketing 199,947 19,625 180,322 919 % Personals 0 % Internet game development 3,643 3,643 100 % Consolidated totals $ 539,155 $ (403,186 ) $ 942,341 234 % Bad Debt expense increased on a net basis by approximately $0.9 million when comparing the year ended November 30, 2006 with the year ended November 30, 2005. Our Fiscal 2006 bad debt expense of approximately $0.5 million includes a $0.15 million reduction attributable to a favorable litigation settlement resulting in a cash based recapture of receivable amounts previously written off for one particular client in a prior fiscal year. Offsetting the recapture, we increased our bad debt reserves for the entire balance of the uncollected receivable related to the loss of a significant customer in the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, as well as providing for bad debt reserves for other smaller receivable balances as at November 30, 2006. Our allowance for bad debt results from our assessment of the risk of collection embedded in our customer base as described below. 60 We continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results, financial condition or bankruptcy filings of our customers. Not all of our customers are publicly traded, or otherwise make available financial information in significant detail. Therefore, there are limits placed on our ability to draw information from financial filings. As a result of our review process, we record adjustments to bad debt provisions/(recoveries) to reflect the related accounts receivable carrying amount to amounts that estimate their probable realizable value. Provisions for bad debts are also recorded resulting from the review of other factors, including (a) length of time the receivables are past due, and (b) historical experience, and other factors obtained during collection efforts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates for bad debt provision/(recoveries) could be further increased or decreased in future fiscal periods. 61 Other Non operating Income (Expense) The components of our Other non operating income (expense) for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005 are set forth below: OTHER NON OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) Other non operating income (expense): 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Interest income and dividends $ 1,068,538 $ 957,069 $ 111,469 12 % Realized gains on sale of marketable securities 16,835 561,359 (544,524 ) 97 % Realized gain on sale of subsidiary 195,000 (195,000 ) 100 % Other non operating income: Other miscellaneous income (expense) 23,996 (6,832 ) 30,828 451 % Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fees and interest expense (51,192 ) (21,244 ) (29,948 ) 141 % Interest and penalties tax audits and settlements (13,902 ) (13,902 ) 100 % Minority interest income (576,000 ) (494,533 ) (81,467 ) 16 % Total consolidated other non operating income: $ 468,275 $ 1,190,819 $ (722,544 ) 61 % Consolidated Other Non operating Income (Expense) decreased approximately $0.7 million, from approximately $1.2 million of other income during the year ended November 30, 2005, to approximately $0.5 million for the year ended November 30, 2006. The material factors contributing to the net decline in other non operating income as forth in the above table are as follows: (a) Interest income increased approximately $0.1 million, or 12%, with the increase related to more favorable interest rates available during Fiscal 2006 when compared to Fiscal 2005. 62 (b) Realized gains on the sale of marketable securities decreased by $0.5 million when compared to the prior years comparable annual period. During the prior year we had substantial selling activity in the equity based portion of our marketable security portfolio, resulting from our decision to recognize unrealized capital gains to take the benefit of expiring capital loss carryforwards. (c) Fiscal 2005 included approximately $0.2 million in installment payments from a prior years sale of a subsidiary. The final installments were collected in Fiscal 2005 and, therefore, no such collections or income were recognized in the comparable period of Fiscal 2006. MINORITY INTEREST During January 2005, we entered into an agreement with Madacy Entertainment, through a newly created partnership, EZTracks LP, to market and promote EZTracks.com, our new web destination consisting of approximately 30,000 downloadable songs covering a wide array of musical genres. We, through a wholly owned subsidiary, own 50.7% of the partnership and will be responsible for managing the operations of the business, including generating traffic to the website, as well as selling advertising on the site. Madacy Entertainment, through its wholly owned subsidiary, owns 49.3% of the partnership and provides its inventory of downloadable music, including an extensive library of downloadable music licensed from other parties. Madacy has limited involvement with certain aspects of operations. The results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2006 include the fully consolidated results of EZTracks LP with minority interest established to reflect Madacys ownership share of the partnerships operating results. The Fiscal 2005 period reflects the fully consolidated results of operations of EZTracks LP for the period January 12, 2005 (inception) to November 30, 2005, with the minority interest established to reflect Madacys ownership share for such period. 63 The following table summarizes the results of EZ Tracks LP for the periods indicated: Year January 21, Ended 2005 to Change Change November 30, November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2006 2005 $$$ %%% Net Revenues $ 10,262,347 $ 8,369,797 $ 1,892,550 23 % Cost of Sales 8,913,489 7,286,976 1,626,513 22 % Gross Profit 1,348,858 1,082,821 266,037 25 % General and Administrative Expenses 180,501 79,712 100,789 126 % Net Income $ 1,168,357 (1 ) $ 1,003,109 (1 ) $ 165,248 16 % Minority interest $ 576,000 (2 ) $ 494,533 (2 ) $ 81,467 16 % Distributions to Minority Interest $ 628,000 $ 128,896 (1) All items included in our Online Advertising and Media Services activities (2) Represents Madacy Entertainments 49.3% minority interest 64 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES We provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined. A final adjustment is made to our provision for income taxes pursuant to the computation of our annual tax provision (benefit). Our current years tax provision approximates $1.6 million, coupled with pre tax income of approximately $3.5 million. This effective rate relationship of 46.2%, when compared to our historical effective rate of approximately 30%, principally results from taxes incurred and expensed from our foreign operations. We settled Scientific Research and Experimental Development Credits (SR&ED credits) for our Canadian (New Brunswick based) subsidiary with the Canadian Revenue Agency for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2002 through 2005. During such Fiscal 2002 to 2005 period, the related items attributable to the SR&ED credit were exhausted. Therefore, under our current tax structure, our Canadian subsidiarys foreign earnings are fully taxed in Canada, and as such, based on the lack of any foreign source income, a foreign tax credit is not available to us on the related foreign taxes, with such taxes being fully included in our US tax provision, resulting in the effective tax rate increase. We are formulating tax planning that should be in place for Fiscal 2007 whereby our future effective tax rate should range from approximately 36% to 39%. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our tax expense (benefit), and deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, and believe that we have adequately provided for all such tax liabilities. Matters raised upon audit from such jurisdictions may involve substantial amounts and could be material. Management considers it unlikely that resolution of any such matters would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements. For the Year Ended November 30, 2005 Compared to Year Ended November 30, 2004 Our net revenues, and the disclosure of our components, for each of the fiscal years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, are detailed in the following tables: 65 Net Revenue Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 44,177,956 $ 28,373,640 $ 15,804,316 56 % Search Engine Marketing 9,599,746 2,059,722 7,540,024 366 % Personals 8,432,402 6,606,541 1,825,861 28 % Internet game development 646,878 241,311 405,567 168 % Consolidated totals $ 62,856,982 $ 37,281,214 $ 25,575,768 69 % Net Revenue increased approximately $25.6 million, or 69%, to $62.8 million for the year ended November 30, 2005, from $37.3 million in the prior year. The Online Advertising and Media Services activities core business grew organically, primarily driven by an extension in our customer base across the majority of our revenue components, coupled with revenues generated from a prior year acquisition, and accounted for approximately $19.8 million of the consolidated revenue increase. The prior year acquisition, Send Traffic, Inc. acquired on June 30, 2004, accounted for approximately $7.5 million of such increase, and contributed approximately $9.6 million, or 15.3% to Fiscal 2005 net revenues, compared to $2.1 million, or 5.5% in Fiscal 2004 revenues. Supplementing our core Online Advertising and Media Service revenue growth was approximately $7.0 million in revenue earned from our January 21, 2005 Hot Rocket acquisition, with such revenue being included in our Online Advertising revenue component. At December 1, 2005, the first month of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2006, we reviewed our segment reporting and determined that we were in one segment, with that segment being the business of Online Advertising and Media Services. We correspondingly have restated all financial information disclosed in the current Form 10 K, for the year ended November 30, 2006, in order not to disrupt any financial statement trend analysis. In Fiscal 2005, and prior, we had reported revenue from an additional segment, LEC Billed Products and Services, which was primarily inactive regarding its contribution to gross margin, income from operations and net income for the period December 1, 2002 through November 30, 2005. The revenues from this collapsed segment have been combined with the Online Advertising revenue component for all periods reported; such revenue declined approximately $1.3 million when comparing Fiscal 2005 with Fiscal 2004, based on our intentional decline in the marketing focus and emphasis applied to this terminated business resulting from its underlying unprofitable customer base. 66 Our cost of sales during the year ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, were comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our Online Advertising and Media Service activities marketing programs, and includes direct response email marketing costs (including related salaries, depreciation and amortization costs), website registrations costs, the cost of customer profiles, other customer acquisition costs, search engine marketing costs, and the related contingent based sweepstakes indemnification expense. The cost of sales, and the disclosure of the components, for each of the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, are set forth below: 67 Cost of Sale Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 26,301,370 $ 15,831,138 $ 10,470,232 66 % Search Engine Marketing 7,770,651 1,623,691 6,146,960 379 % Personals 6,776,885 4,520,673 2,256,212 50 % Internet game development 203,354 77,108 126,246 164 % Consolidated totals $ 41,052,260 $ 22,052,610 $ 18,999,650 86 % Cost of sales on a consolidated basis increased $19.0 million, or 86%, to $41 million for the year ended November 30, 2005, from $22.1 million for the year ended November 30, 2004. 68 The primary factor contributing to the increase in consolidated cost of sales was related to a net increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 66%, in costs incurred in the generation of our Online Advertising revenue stream. Online Advertising costs include: (a) purchases of online advertising space, which increased $4.3 million, and was the result of our January 21, 2005 acquisition of our Hot Rocket Marketing subsidiary; (b) purchases of website advertising registrations, which increased $7.2 million, and was the result of our increased website presence and expanded website based marketing efforts; (c) costs incurred from our email marketing activities which increased $0.8 million, and was the result of our expansion and increased reliance email delivered from internal sources; (d) costs associated with the indemnification for potential sweepstakes payouts which decreased approximately $0.1 million, and was the result of a decline in the promotion of sweepstake offers; and (e) the inclusion in Online Advertising of a approximate $1.7 million decrease in costs incurred from our collapsed LEC segment, as previously discussed, and further referenced in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Our Search Engine Marketing costs increased $6.1 million, or 379%, and correlates to our increased focus on growing our search engine marketing business, as well as using our in house search engine marketing capabilities to generate revenues for our Personals business, and our other Online Advertising and Media Services activity revenue components. In our Personals business, costs incurred in the acquisition of new customer profiles increased $2.3 million, or 50%, and was the result of unitary profile cost increases based on highly competitive market conditions encountered in profile acquisitions. The increase in Internet game development costs relates specifically to the manpower costs required for the game development activities, with such costs increasing $0.1 million, or 164%. Our gross profit in terms of dollars, on a segmental basis, and our gross profit percentage, on a segmental basis, for each of the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004, are set forth below: 69 Gross Profit Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ 17,876,586 $ 12,542,502 $ 5,334,084 43 % Search Engine Marketing 1,829,095 436,031 1,393,064 319 % Personals 1,655,517 2,085,868 (430,351 ) 21 % Internet game development 443,524 164,203 279,321 170 % Consolidated totals $ 21,804,722 $ 15,228,604 $ 6,576,118 43 % Gross Profit Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Absolute Relative Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 %%% %%% Online Advertising 40.5 % 44.2 % 3.7 % 8.5 % Search Engine Marketing 19.1 % 21.2 % 2.1 % 10.0 % Personals 19.6 % 31.6 % 12.0 % 37.8 % Internet game development 68.6 % 68.0 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Consolidated totals 34.7 % 40.8 % 6.1 % 15.1 % 70 Consolidated Gross Profit ("gross margin") as a percentage of net revenue was 34.7% during the year ended November 30, 2005, compared to 40.8% in the prior year, representing an absolute percentage point decrease of 6.2%, or a 15.1% decrease on a relative basis. The decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to three factors: (1) The impact on gross margin from our Online Advertising business, which decreased 3.7% in absolute terms, and 8.5% in relative terms, and was primarily the result of increased competitive market forces affecting the cost of acquisition of registered users that are marketed our services, and our clients products and services, once registered. (2) Search engine marketing gross margin decreased 2.1% in absolute terms, and 10% in relative terms as a result of our significant expansion of our search engine marketing services and the related declines encountered in growing such business, coupled with cost increases arising from increased competitive market conditions. (3) In our Personals business, we expense customer acquisition costs during the period we acquire a free Personals membership account, while the recognition of the revenue is dependent upon whether or not the free account converts to a paying membership. The period that a free account may convert to a billable account ranges from one week after acquisition, to as long as two years, after its initial month of acquisition, based on available historical conversion to billable experience. The costs of acquiring free memberships has risen in Fiscal 2005 approximately three fold, and that conversion rates regarding first time conversion and renewal billing retention have both declined during Fiscal 2005, with both factors having a negative impact on the future growth potential and the future fiscal period profit generating potential of our Personals business. We believe the primary cause for the cost increase results from the market conditions regarding competition; where our competitors continue to increase the cost that they accept to pay for new member data. 71 Our Selling Expenses for each of the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004 are presented in the table set forth below: Selling Expense Components Online Advertising and Media Service Activities Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Fee share commissions $ 2,426,527 $ 1,190,894 $ 1,235,633 104 % Selling salaries and related costs 2,545,218 1,072,652 1,472,566 137 % Travel, entertainment, shows, other 261,613 280,792 (19,179 ) 7 % Consolidated totals $ 5,233,358 $ 2,544,338 $ 2,689,020 106 % Selling expenses, on a consolidated basis, increased approximately $2.7 million, or 106%, to $5.2 million during the year ended November 30, 2005 from $2.5 million during the year ended November 30, 2004. The increase resulted from an approximate $1.2 million increase in fee share commissions correlating to our increased use of third party databases used to generate our email marketing program revenues included in our Online Advertising revenue component. We are the primary obligor to the third party list owner and bear the responsibility of payment to the list owner regardless of whether or not our client pays us. Additionally, selling salaries and related costs increased approximately $1.5 million, or 137%, during the year ended November 30, 2005 as a result of increased sales commissions (on total revenues of $62.9 million for the year ended November 30, 2005 compared to the year ended November 30, 2005 total revenues of $37.3 million), as well as from increases in our consolidated sales staff resulting from Fiscal 2004s Send Traffic acquisition and Fiscal 2005s Hot Rocket Marketing acquisition. 72 Our general and administrative expenses ("G&A") are principally comprised of (i) compensation costs and related expenses for executive, finance, information and operation systems, and general administration personnel, (ii) professional fees (which include legal; audit, accounting and tax; public relations; database management and consulting; and public company related printing and filing costs), (iii) insurance costs, (iv) occupancy and other equipment rental costs, (v) site development, maintenance and modification costs related to our various active segments, and (vi) all other general and miscellaneous corporate expense items.

The significant portion of the net increase was attributable to an increase in compensation expense of $1.3 million, or 17%, attributable to the growth in our employee base in Fiscal 2005 resulting from the acquisition of Hot Rocket Marketing on January 21, 2005, and the inclusion of a full year of employee cost in Fiscal 2005 when compared to Fiscal 2004 and that years June 30, 2004 acquisition of Send Traffic, Inc. Depreciation and amortization increased $0.7 million, or 89%, resulting from the Fiscal 2005 Hot Rocket acquisition and the Fiscal 2004 Send Traffic acquisition, and their respective amortization costs related to acquired identifiable intangible assets. Additionally, increases in occupancy costs and other miscellaneous G&A of approximately $240,000, attributable the recent acquisitions, were primarily offset by combined decreases in insurance and legal expenses, resulting from a decline in our Fiscal 2005 directors and officers insurance premium renewal. 74 Feder, Kaszovitz, Isaacson, Weber, Skala, Bass and Rhine LLP (FKIWSBR) provides general legal services to us in the ordinary course of business and litigation services in defense of actions arising from such business activities. Murray L. Skala, a partner in such firm, has been a member of our Board of Directors since inception to August 25, 2006. During the year ended November 30, 2005, we incurred approximately $0.87 million in legal fees (exclusive of disbursements), of which $0.70 million was expensed, and $0.17 million was capitalized in the Hot Rocket acquisition. The $0.70 million of FKIWSBR expense was then reduced by $0.36 million, representing amounts recoverable from our insurance providers under the terms of their respective coverage provisions. We incurred approximately $0.3 million in legal fees (exclusive of disbursements) from FKIWSBR during the year ended November 30, 2004. 75 Bad Debt Expense and (Recapture) Components Online Advertising and Media Services Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Online Advertising $ (422,811 ) $ 294,336 $ (717,147 ) 244 % Search Engine Marketing 19,625 91,284 (71,659 ) 79 % Personals Internet game development 21,079 (21,079 ) 100 % Consolidated totals $ (403,186 ) $ 406,699 $ (809,885 ) 199 % Bad Debt expense decreased on a net basis by approximately $0.8 million, or 199%, to a net bad debt recapture of $0.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2005, as compared to bad debt expense of $0.4 million incurred in the year ended November 30, 2004. During the year ended November 30, 2005, we settled a dispute with Qwest Communications International Inc., where, in accordance with the arbitration settlement, Qwest was required to pay us $600,000, plus interest. Such amount represented revenue earned in fiscal years dating back to Fiscal 2000, the year in which the agreement was wrongfully terminated, and the year we commenced the arbitration. During Fiscal 2000, we had not recorded the $600,000 of revenue based on the questionable nature of its receipt pursuant to the final arbitration decision, effectively recording bad debt expense in that year. Upon the Fiscal 2005 settlement of the arbitration in our favor, we recorded the receipt as a bad debt recapture in accordance with the original recording in Fiscal 2000. Offsetting this bad debt recapture was approximately $197,000 in net increases in our reserves for smaller accounts. Our allowance for bad debts results from our assessment of the risk of collection embedded in our customer base as described below. 76 We continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results, financial condition or bankruptcy filings of our customers. Not all of our customers are publicly traded, or otherwise make available financial information in significant detail. Therefore, there are limits placed on our ability to draw information from financial filings. As a result of our review process, we record adjustments to bad debt provisions/(recoveries) to reflect the related accounts receivable carrying amount to amounts that estimate their probable realizable value. Provisions for bad debts are also recorded resulting from the review of other factors, including (a) length of time the receivables are past due, and (b) historical experience, and other factors obtained during collection efforts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates for bad debt provision/(recoveries) could be further increased or decreased in future fiscal periods. Other Non operating Income (Expense) The components of our Other non operating income (expense) for the years ended November 30, 2005 and 2004 are set forth below: 77 OTHER NON OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Change Change Year Ended November 30, Inc(Dec) Inc(Dec) Other non operating income (expense): 2005 2004 $$$ %%% Interest income and dividends $ 957,069 $ 544,153 $ 412,916 76 % Realized gains on sale of marketable securities 561,359 25,490 535,869 2102 % Realized gain on sale of subsidiary 195,000 784,900 (589,900 ) 75 % Other non operating income: Other miscellaneous income (expense) (6,832 ) 104,311 (111,143 ) 107 % Vendor settlement on prior year year marketing fee 350,000 (350,000 ) 100 % Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fees and interest expense (21,244 ) (20,793 ) (451 ) 2 % Interest and penalties tax audits and settlements (69,581 ) 69,581 100 % Reduction of prior yearss LEC reserve 34,181 (34,181 ) 100 % Minority interest income (494,533 ) (494,533 ) 100 % Total consolidated other non operating income: $ 1,190,819 $ 1,752,661 $ (561,842 ) 32 % Consolidated Other Income (Expense) decreased approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $1.8 million during the year ended November 30, 2004, to approximately $1.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2005. The material factors contributing to the net decrease as set forth in the above table are as follows: (a) Interest income increased approximately $0.4 million, or 76%, with the increase related to more favorable rates available during Fiscal 2005 when compared to Fiscal 2004. The general interest rate environment improved, as measured by the average 12 month treasury yield of 2.68% in Fiscal 2005, compared to 1.41% in Fiscal 2004, for a relative increase of 90% compared to our interest income increase of 76%. Additionally, interest income was positively impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 with approximately $68,000 of interest income paid to the Company, as a result of a settlement award secured by the Company in an arbitration action against a vendor. 78 (b) Realized gains on the sale of marketable securities increased by approximately $0.5 million over the comparable prior year period. This resulted from our decision in the first quarter of Fiscal 2005 to recognize unrealized gains on our equity security portfolio enabling us to utilize the federal tax benefits of capital loss carryforwards that were set to expire within the next 24 months. (c) The year ended November 30, 2004 included $0.8 million in installment payments from a prior years sale of a subsidiary, compared to $0.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2005. The decline was the result of the installment agreement being completed in February, 2005. (d) The prior year ended November 30, 2004 included a collection of approximately $0.4 million in settlement of a prior years marketing agreement dispute. No comparable amount is reflected in the year ended November 30, 2005. 79 (e) Minority Interest resulting from our EZ Tracks partnership with Madacy Entertainment in Fiscal 2005 amounted to $0.5 million. The partnership agreement was entered into on January 12, 2005 and, as such, the prior year comparable period includes no comparable amount. On January 12, 2005, we entered into an agreement with Madacy Entertainment, through a newly created partnership, EZTracks LP, to market and promote EZTracks.com, our new web destination consisting of approximately 30,000 downloadable songs covering a wide array of musical genres. We, through a wholly owned subsidiary, own 50.7% of the partnership and will be responsible for managing the operations of the business, including generating traffic to the website, as well as selling advertising on the site. Madacy Entertainment, through its wholly owned subsidiary, owns 49.3% of the partnership and provides its inventory of downloadable music, including an extensive library of downloadable music licensed from other parties. Madacy has limited involvement with certain aspects of operations. The results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2005 include the fully consolidated results of EZTracks LP with minority interest established to reflect Madacys ownership share of the partnerships operating results for the period January 12, 2005 to November 30, 2005. 80 The following table set forth below summarizes the results of EZ Tracks LP for the period indicated: January 21, 2005 to November 30, 2005 Net Revenues $ 8,369,797 Cost of Sales 7,286,976 Gross Profit 1,082,821 General and Administrative Expenses 79,712 Net Income (1 ) $ 1,003,109 Minority interest (2 ) $ 494,533 Distributions to Minority Interest $ 128,896 (1) All items included in the Companys Online Advertising and Media Services activities (2) Represents Madacy Entertainments 49.3% minority interest PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES We provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined. A final adjustment is made to our provision for income taxes pursuant to the computation of our annual tax provision (benefit). Our current years tax provision approximates $1.0 million, coupled with pre tax income of approximately $3.5 million. This effective rate relationship of 30.0%, when compared to our historical effective rate of approximately 36% results from two factors. We benefited from state tax benefits partially offset by foreign income tax expense. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we settled state tax audits which resulted in an approximate tax benefit of $200,000. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our tax expense (benefit), and deferred tax assets and liabilities. We are subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, and believe that we have adequately provided for all such tax liabilities. Matters raised upon audit from such jurisdictions may involve substantial amounts and could be material. Management considers it unlikely that resolution of any such matters would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements. 81 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of November 30, 2006, we had aggregate working capital of $31.7 million compared to aggregate working capital of $30.7 million as of November 30, 2005. We had available cash, cash equivalents, equities and readily available marketable debt securities of $30.4 million as of November 30, 2006, compared to available cash, cash equivalents, equities and readily available marketable debt securities of $28.2 million as of November 30, 2005. The equity component of our marketable securities was $2.0 million at November 30, 2006, compared to $1.9 million at November 30, 2005. At November 30, 2006, all annuity contracts mature within one year, compared to $2.66 million of long term annuity maturities at November 30, 2005. 82 Cash provided by operating activities was approximately $5.9 million for the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to approximately $1.0 million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended November 30, 2005, representing an approximate $4.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities. Changes in assets and liabilities of the business, net of acquisitions, provided $2.7 million more in cash when comparing the year ended November 30, 2006 with the year ended November 30, 2005. Additionally, there was an increase in stock based compensation of approximately $0.5 million, when comparing the year ended November 30, 2006 to the year ended November 30, 2005, and was primarily the result of our December 1, 2005 SFAS 123R adoption related to stock based compensation, which yielded a non cash amortization charge of approximately $0.5 million in Fiscal 2006. Cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.1 million during the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $3.4 million of cash provided by investing activities during the year ended November 30, 2005. The primary use of cash in investing activities during the year ended November 30, 2006 was related to approximately $0.9 million expended on the Hot Rocket contingent additional purchase price payment and $0.5 million expended on fixed asset acquisitions. During the year ended November 30, 2005, net proceeds from the sale of securities and subsidiary sales exceeded cash used in security purchases by approximately $7 million and was offset by approximately $3.1 million expended in the Hot Rocket asset acquisition and $0.4 million in cash paid for capital expenditures and licenses. 83 Cash used for financing activities was approximately $5.2 million during the year ended November 30, 2006, compared to $2.6 million used by financing activities during the year ended November 30, 2005. Fiscal 2006 cash outflows were attributable to: (a) dividends paid of approximately $4.6 million; (b) a distribution of $0.6 million to a minority interest holder; and (c) $0.2 million in capital lease obligation payments, offset by $0.2 million in financing proceeds from stock option exercises. In Fiscal 2005 we paid dividends of approximately $4.5 million and made approximately $0.1 million in distributions to a minority interest holder. We offset such outflows with approximately $2.1 million in proceeds from stock options exercised. Our days sales outstanding ("DSO") in accounts receivable at November 30, 2006 was 45 days, compared to 56 days at August 31, 2006, 46 days at May 31, 2006, 54 days at February 28, 2006, and 65 days at November 30, 2005. The 11 day, or 20% decrease in the current quarters DSO compared to the third quarter of this fiscal year relates to approximately $2.4 million in collections from a former client that terminated its association with us in September 2006 (and which clients accounts receivable was approximately $2.7 million at August 31, 2006), coupled with an approximate $2.5 million decline in Fiscal 2006 fourth quarter revenue. The majority of our customers are extended 30 day credit terms. In limited instances, customer credit is extended in ranges exceeding 30 days, and in very limited circumstances can exceed 180 days. We continually monitor customer adherence to credit terms and constantly strive to improve the effectiveness of our collection efforts with the goal of achieving a DSO in the 40 day range. Future fiscal periods might not reflect this goal of a 40 day DSO, and might exceed the 51 day DSO recognized during the year ended November 30, 2006. 84 Historically, our primary cash requirements have been used to fund the cost of advertising and promotion and test marketing new services and promotions, with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines, further development of businesses being test marketed and for the development of the equipment infrastructure of our subsidiaries. Our future plans and business strategy may continue to call for our Internet based On line Advertising and Media Service activities to be our sole operating focus as it was for the years ended November 30, 2006 and 2005. Our cash demands for capital expenditures and equipment lease obligations have increased to $0.719 million during the year ended November 30, 2006 compared to $0.519 million during the year ended November 30, 2005. Our capital expenditures and capital lease obligation payments during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2002 to 2004 were (in millions): $1.9, $1.5, and $0.141, respectively. The significant portion of Fiscal 2006 and 2005s capital expenditure was for new email servers that substantially reduced our reliance on and related additional costs associated with third party email delivery suppliers. All other outlays for capital expenditures were also used to support other facets of our Online Advertising and Media Services business. 85 We may, in future fiscal periods, be required to invest significant amounts of capital into our business. If our operations fail to generate sufficient revenue, we could realize a material adverse impact on our capital and liquidity resources resulting from expenditures necessary to generate such revenue, including, but not limited to, expenditures for (a) marketing campaigns, including media costs and other costs of customer acquisition information, (b) service and or product development costs, (c) site development and maintenance and related technology based costs, (d) potential online, and or off line, business acquisitions, or (e) costs associated with developing alternative means of email promotion delivery. On January 21, 2005, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Hot Rocket Acquisition Corp., acquired all of the intangible assets of Hot Rocket Marketing Inc. and Clockwork Advertising Inc. (collectively Hot Rocket), corporations in the business of buying and selling performance based online advertising space for third parties, as well as providing such services to the sales activities of our consolidated entity. The Hot Rocket acquisition has broadened our reach into the Internet direct marketing arena, which continues to allow for expanded client relationships and various other synergistic possibilities, such as adding value to our core operations by the enhancement of our current and developing marketing programs conducted in our Online Advertising and Media Services activities. The initial purchase price was approximately $3.8 million and was comprised of $3.1 million in cash, $0.7 million (or 113,821 shares) of our common stock and transaction fees approximating $0.1 million. Pursuant to an independent third party valuation, the reported purchase price was allocated approximately $2.2 million towards goodwill and $1.6 million of identifiable intangibles. There were no tangible assets acquired. 86 In addition to the initial purchase price of the acquisition, we agreed to pay Hot Rocket a contingent purchase price of up to $12.5 million if Hot Rocket generates an aggregate of $27 million in EBITDA (as quantified in the Agreement) over the four year period following the closing. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, for the period February 1, 2005 to January 31, 2006, we were liable for a combined additional purchase price payment of $1.467 million, which has been settled by a cash payment of approximately $0.886 million made on May 9, 2006, and an issuance of 103,354 shares issued on May 10, 2006 (then having a fair market value of approximately $0.581 million). Future contingent payments made, if any, will be treated as additional purchase price and included as an addition to goodwill. The terms of the acquisition agreement also provide for additional contingent payments of purchase price for the periods February 1, 2006 through July 31, 2006, and August 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007, upon the attainment of certain EBITDA thresholds as specified in the Agreement. Hot Rocket did not reach the $1.35 million EBITDA threshold for the period ended July 31, 2006, and the possibility exists that for the period ending January 31, 2007, the EBITDA threshold will not be attained. Therefore, as of November 30, 2006, based on the lack of absolute certainty regarding the EBITDA threshold as it relates to the additional payment period ending January 31, 2007, we have not accrued any additional contingent payments at this time. Future contingencies, if any, will be recorded when the contingency has been satisfied and the additional consideration is issued or becomes issuable. 87 The shares of common stock issued to Hot Rocket were originally issued by us in non public transactions, which issuances were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. On June 30, 2004, we consummated the acquisition of the assets of SendTraffic.com, Inc. (Send) and its affiliated entity, The Traffic Group, LLC, (TG), privately held search engine marketing companies based in New York. We purchased the assets for approximately $5.0 million, comprised of $3.5 million in cash and 176,799 shares of Traffix common stock. The asset acquisition agreement calls for contingent earn out payments based on the post closing attainment of certain earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) thresholds during the thirty six month period following the transaction. As of November 30, 2006, none of the contractual thresholds were attained, and it is not deemed probable that any remaining threshold will be reached during the remainder of the post closing period. Under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions, management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources and working capital, as described above, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Additionally, as we seek to further extend our reach into the Online Advertising and Media Services arena, as well as potentially identify new and other consumer oriented services and products, we may use existing cash reserves, enter into long term financing arrangements, acquire the assets or securities of other companies, or employ other means to finance such diversification, none of which is specifically identifiable or measurable at this time. 88 OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS We are not aware of any specific factors, outside of those described in the following table, and those potential factors described in the Critical Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimate Discussion which is set forth below, that are reasonably likely to cause a material impact, either positive or negative, on our liquidity trends. Additionally, we do not have off balance sheet arrangements, other than those described in the following table, and do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts. A summary table of future contractual commitments, for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases and employment contracts are set forth below: Total Contractual Operating Leases Employment agreements Other Obligations Domestic Foreign Domestic Foreign Domestic Domestic Foreign 2007 $ 489,910 $ 1,978,157 $ 300,000 $ 2,468,067 $ 300,000 2008 450,500 398,827 325,000 849,327 325,000 2009 351,625 198,168 350,000 549,793 350,000 2010 353,001 28,658 381,659 2011 292,142 292,142 $ 1,937,178 $ $ 2,603,810 $ 975,000 $ $ 4,540,988 $ 975,000 89 RELATED PARTIES Feder, Kaszovitz, Isaacson, Weber, Skala, Bass and Rhine LLP (FKIWSBR) provides general legal services to us in the ordinary course of business and litigation services in defense of actions arising from such business activities. Murray L. Skala, a partner in such firm, had been a member of our Board of Directors from inception to August 25, 2006, at which time he chose not to stand for re election. FKIWSBR legal services are billed on an arms length transaction basis. We incurred approximately $0.3 million in legal fees (exclusive of disbursements), as reduced by approximately $30,000 in settlement awards, from FKIWSBR during the year ended November 30, 2006. We incurred approximately $0.87 million in legal fees (exclusive of disbursements) from FKIWSBR during the year ended November 30, 2005, of which $0.70 million was expensed, and $0.17 was capitalized in the Hot Rocket acquisition. The $0.70 million of FKIWSBR expense was then reduced by $0.36 million, representing amounts recoverable from our insurance providers under the terms of their respective coverage provisions. TRANSACTIONS WITH MAJOR CUSTOMERS During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2006, we had seven customers which, in combination, accounted for approximately $22.4 million, or 31% of consolidated net revenues during such period, and approximately $3.1 million, or 35% of consolidated net accounts receivable as of November 30, 2006. The seven customers accounted for 7.7%, 7.3%, 5.7%, 3.4%, 2.6%, 2.1%, and 2.0% of consolidated net revenue for the year ended November 30, 2006. 90 During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005, we had eight customers which, in combination, accounted for approximately $20.6 million, or 33% of consolidated net revenues during such period, and approximately $5.7 million, or 51% of consolidated net accounts receivable as of November 30, 2005. The eight customers accounted for 11.3%, 5.2%, 3.2%, 3.0%, 2.9%, 2.6%, 2.4%, and 2.3% of consolidated net revenue for the year ended November 30, 2005. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE DISCUSSION In accordance with the Commissions Release Nos. 33 8040 and 34 45149 and FR 60 issued in December 2001, referencing the Commissions statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices, we have set forth below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows, if general business conditions or individual customer financial circumstances change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any "forward looking" statements contained herein. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most significant estimates relate to reserves for uncollectible receivables, recoverability of long lived assets, and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Additionally, we have potential exposure resulting from pending and or threatened litigation for which we currently assess no risk and do not provide for loss. No provision for loss has been recorded for the potential of currently unknown actions naming us as defendant in future fiscal periods. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 91 FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Historically High Levels of Volatility in Revenue and Cost Trends Our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied. Our revenues, cost of providing revenues, profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among our Online and Media Service components, as well as on a consolidated basis. The revenue derived from our Online and Media Service components may likely be different in future fiscal periods due to several factors, including consumer tastes, business opportunities, and regulatory issues that may exist in future periods. Therefore, it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends, and their corresponding impact on liquidity and capital resources. Actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis, which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations. Historically, we have been able to rapidly react to changes in the business environment within which we operate. Management responds to these changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change, and as dictated by the nature of such changes. Managements reaction to such changes could cover a broad range of business related adjustments, ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions, to entire business model overhauls. Based on our current operations and marketing methods, as well as the dynamic, ever changing status of the Internet marketing environment, it is conceivable that we would institute changes to our business practices in future fiscal periods. There can be no assurance that any such potential change would be successful in its implementation, and there can be no assurance that any such implementation would benefit our operating margins, profitability, cash flows or capital resources. 92 Revenue Recognition, Variable Costs and Bad Debts We currently earn our revenue from our Online and Media Service activities pursuant to marketing agreements with our marketing partners and corporate customers. The provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded. We invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement. Revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered, or service is provided, net of an estimated sales allowance, when applicable. Such sales allowance may include an estimate for duplications, invalid addresses, and or age restrictions that are due from, but have not yet been reported to us by our customers. These sales allowances are recorded as contra revenue. Our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual sales allowances vary from amounts previously estimated. Historically, the variance between actual sales allowances and previously estimated sales allowances has been immaterial. If events were to occur that would cause actual sales allowances (which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue, as contra revenues, in arriving at reported net revenue) to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements, we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins, and, therefore, our profitability, cash flows and capital resources could be adversely affected. 93 Certain revenue related obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. They include costs payable to other online, as well as off line, media companies for generating registered users and consumer data for us, database fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements, email message delivery costs, contingent based prize indemnification coverage (i.e. sweepstakes payout indemnification), estimated premium fulfillment costs related to the respective promotion (when and if applicable) and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized. When our estimates vary from that which was originally accrued, the associated variance is deemed a change in managements estimate, and accordingly we take the increase or decrease to sales, costs, or overhead in the fiscal period that the variance is determinable. Should the Internet operating landscape change resulting in (a) higher costs of acquiring consumer data and registered users for our websites; (b) higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners, compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate sized databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements; (c) the InfiKnowledge asset acquisition failing to maintain a lower cost of our email delivery activities and web development and web hosting service costs as compared to our competitors, or us being required to depend on third party emailing service bureaus, to a degree higher, and or at a cost in excess of our anticipated internally generated costs, (d) our contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the sites; or (e) unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications; then, if any one, or a combination, of the above factors were to materialize we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins and, therefore, our profitability, cash flows and capital resources could be materially adversely affected. 94 Revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable. We continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results, financial condition, or bankruptcy filings, of our customers. As a result of this review process, we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an estimated realizable value. Provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience and other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts. If circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis, or if demand for Internet direct marketing softens, or if the U.S. economy stumbles, our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased, which could adversely affect our operating margins, profitability, cash flows and capital resources. 95 Impairment of Goodwill, Other Intangibles and investment Portfolio Could Impact net Income We carry goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet arising from current and prior year acquisitions. We are required to review, at least annually goodwill for any asset impairment. If the review of the goodwill related to the subsidiaries organized to acquire such assets determines that such goodwill is impaired, then we will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value. Should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge, we would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment. Cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge, but cash flows would, most likely, be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge. As of November 30, 2006, we performed our annual review of goodwill and determined there to be no impairment, and have not recognized any events through the date of this report that would negatively impact goodwill. Market Fluctuation and Debt Repayment Risk of Marketable Securities Investment Portfolio We maintain an investment portfolio that is managed by prominent financial institutions. The portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities, and common stock equities, all of which are held for varying periods of time, pursuant to maturity dates, market conditions and other factors. The fair value of our investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies as of November 30, 2006 amounted to approximately $2.0 million. These investments are subject to market price volatility, in addition to the potential for business failure at the company level. Moreover, due to the potential for an economic downturn and the potential of related fiscal difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments, our investment portfolio could become impaired by the failure of such companies to fulfill their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity. Additionally, our cash flows and interest income could be negatively impacted by Federal Reserve Bank interest rate reductions, if any. 96 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Qualifying Financial Statement Misstatements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should qualify misstatements when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors. SAB 108 also provides transition accounting disclosure guidance for situations in which a material error existed in prior period financial statements by allowing companies to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for our Company in Fiscal 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SAB 108 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 97 In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies certain provisions of SFAS No. 109 by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A tax benefit from such uncertain tax positions may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not believe the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on its financial statements. During the year ended November 30, 2006, specifically effective December 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). See Notes 2 and 3 of the attached audited financial statements for additional disclosure on SFAS 123R. 98
