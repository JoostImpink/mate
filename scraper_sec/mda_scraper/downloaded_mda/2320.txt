Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview As of December 31, 2006, we: Owned or jointly controlled 721 industrial, office and retail properties (including properties under development), consisting of approximately 113.8 million square feet; and Owned or jointly controlled more than 6,400 acres of unencumbered land with an estimated future development potential of more than 93 million square feet of industrial, office and retail properties. We provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures: Property leasing; Property management; Construction; Development; and Other tenant related services. 16 Management Philosophy and Priorities Our key business and financial strategies for the future include the following: Our business objective is to increase FFO by (i) maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties; (ii) developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets; (iii) expanding geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets; (iv) using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis; (v) developing and repositioning properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through our Service Operations property sale program; and (vi) providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties. See the Year in Review section below for further explanation and definition of FFO. Our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. This strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities. We seek to maintain a well balanced, conservative and flexible capital structure by: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than 20%; (iii) pursuing current and future long term debt financings and refinancing generally on an unsecured basis; (iv) maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios; and (v) issuing attractively priced perpetual preferred equity for 5 10% of our total capital structure. Year in Review During 2006, we successfully executed on our strategy that we began in earnest in 2005 to improve our portfolio of held for investment buildings through our capital recycling program, increasing our development pipeline to over $1.2 billion, and initiating geographic expansion that we anticipate will provide future earnings growth. As a result of these accomplishments, we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available for common unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $159.8 million, or $1.07 per unit (diluted), compared to net income of $339.2 million, or $2.18 per unit (diluted) for the year ended 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $201.5 million gain from the sale of a portfolio of 212 real estate properties (the Industrial Portfolio Sale) that occurred in 2005 which was partially offset by income generated by current year building sales, acquired properties and organic growth. Through increased leasing activity, we achieved a growth in rental revenues from continuing operations in 2006 over 2005 as our in service portfolio occupancy increased from 92.7% at the end of 2005 to 92.9% at the end of 2006. As an important performance metric for us as a real estate company, FFO available to common unitholders totaled $371.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $374.3 million for the same period in 2005 which is the result of the time necessary to redeploy the proceeds from the Industrial Portfolio Sale noted above into FFO generating assets. Industry analysts and investors use FFO as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity REIT. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the Board of Governors of the NAREIT. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 17 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation, among other items, from GAAP net income. Management believes that the use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and makes comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance (although FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance) because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, FFO assists in comparing the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The following table summarizes the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income available for common unitholders $ 159,799 $ 339,239 $ 167,212 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 254,268 254,170 228,582 Partnership share of joint venture depreciation and amortization 18,394 19,510 18,901 Earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned (42,089) (227,513) (26,510) Earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture (18,802) (11,096) Funds From Operations $ 371,570 $ 374,310 $ 388,185 Throughout 2006, we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from Moodys (Baa1), Standard & Poors (BBB+) and Fitch (BBB+). Our debt to total market capitalization ratio (total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding Common Units and Preferred equity plus outstanding indebtedness) of 37.4% at December 31, 2006 compared to 31.8% at December 31, 2005 continues to provide us financial flexibility to fund new investments. Highlights of our debt financing activity in 2006 are as follows: In January 2006, we renewed our line of credit, including the extension of the maturity date to January 2010 and the increase of borrowing capacity by $500.0 million to $1.0 billion with interest rates ranging from LIBOR +. 17% to LIBOR +. 525% as of December 31, 2006. We had $317.0 million outstanding on our line of credit as of December 31, 2006. Through new issuances, as well as assumptions of debt in conjunction with our 2006 acquisitions, we added $540.6 million of new secured debt in 2006 at a weighted average interest rate of 6.09% and we retired $40.6 million of secured debt of which $25.0 million was variable rate. We issued $854.5 million of unsecured debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.97% and retired $350.0 million of unsecured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.05%. We issued $575.0 million of 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes (Exchangeable Notes) in November 2006. The Exchangeable Notes can be exchanged for shares of the General Partners common stock upon certain events as well as at any time beginning on August 1, 2011 and ending on the second business day prior to the maturity date. The Exchangeable Notes will have an initial exchange rate of approximately 20.4298 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an exchange price of approximately $48.95 per share of the General Partners common stock and an exchange premium of approximately 20.0% based on the last reported sale price of $40.79 per share of the General Partners common stock on the date of issuance. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances, including increases in 18 the General Partners rate of dividends. Upon exchange, the holders of the Exchangeable Notes would receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and, at the General Partners option, either cash or shares of its common stock for the remaining balance due. In order to reduce potential dilution of the General Partners common stock, we purchased a capped call option with the proceeds of the Exchangeable Notes offering that allows us to buy the General Partners common shares, up to a maximum of approximately 11.7 million shares or the General Partners common stock, from the option counterparties at prescribed prices. The capped call option will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the related Exchangeable Notes or the first day all of the related Exchangeable Notes are no longer outstanding due to exchange or otherwise. The capped call option, which cost $27.0 million, was recorded as a reduction of partners equity and effectively increased the exchange price to 40% above the General Partners stock price on the issuance date. On the equity side of our balance sheet, the General Partner repurchased approximately 2.2 million of its common shares for approximately $89.4 million from the proceeds of our Exchangeable Notes issuance. Additionally, the General Partner issued two new series of preferred equity securities, 6.95% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares and 7.25% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, for total gross proceeds of $294.0 million while the General Partner redeemed its 8.45% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of $75.0 million. We continued strategic initiatives to expand geographically and projects to leverage our development, construction and management capabilities as follows: We completed the acquisition of a Washington D.C. metropolitan area portfolio of 32 suburban in service office and light industrial properties, the assets of a related real estate management company, as well as significant undeveloped land positions (all referred to as the Mark Winkler Portfolio) for a purchase price of approximately $867.6 million. In December 2006, we contributed 23 of the in service properties to joint ventures in which we hold a 30% continuing interest. We will contribute eight in service properties to the joint ventures in the first quarter of 2007. We completed the purchase of a portfolio of industrial real estate properties in Savannah, Georgia consisting of 18 buildings for a purchase price of approximately $196.2 million. We increased our investment in undeveloped land to provide greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle. Throughout 2006, we completed land acquisitions totaling $436.7 million. The new land positions include industrial, office and retail positions in several markets, including the Washington D.C., Baltimore, Houston, and Phoenix markets, which we entered during 2006. We disposed of 19 non strategic wholly owned held for rental properties, most notably our entire Cleveland industrial portfolio, for $139.9 million of gross proceeds. Additionally, unconsolidated subsidiaries disposed of 22 non strategic held for rental properties of which our share of the gross proceeds totaled $91.9 million. These transactions were a continuation of our long term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments. Finally, we will continue to develop long term investment assets to be held in our portfolio and develop assets to be sold upon completion. With over $1.2 billion in our development pipeline at December 31, 2006, we are encouraged about the long term growth opportunities in our business. 19 Key Performance Indicators Our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our office and industrial properties (Rental Operations). The following highlights the areas of Rental Operations that we consider critical for future revenue growth. (All square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures.) Occupancy Analysis: As discussed above, our ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations. The following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of rental properties as of December 31 (in thousands, except percentage data): Total Percent of Square Feet Total Square Feet Percent Occupied Type 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Industrial Service Centers 4,562 4,724 4.2 % 4.8 % 91.6 % 91.7 % Bulk 71,743 62,377 65.6 % 63.8 % 93.2 % 94.3 % Office 32,377 30,123 29.6 % 30.8 % 92.2 % 89.3 % Other 611 611 0.6 % 0.6 % 99.1 % 96.0 % Total 109,293 97,835 100.0 % 100.0 % 92.9 % 92.7 % We experienced continued strong occupancy in our in service portfolio with the overall increase driven primarily by a 3.1% increase in the occupancy of our office portfolio. Lease Expiration and Renewals: Our ability to maintain and grow occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space. The following table reflects our in service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of December 31, 2006. The table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents (based on December 2006 rental revenue) under expiring leases (in thousands, except percentage data): Total Portfolio Industrial Office Other Square Ann.

Our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a 70 80% success rate. We do not presently expect this renewal percentage in 2007 to differ from that experienced in 2006. Future Development: Another source of growth in earnings is the development of additional properties. These properties should provide future earnings through income upon sale or from Rental Operations growth as they are placed in service. We had 10.6 million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to 9.0 million square feet and total costs of $658.7 million at December 31, 2005. We have increased our development pipeline significantly through 2006 and will continue to focus on the development side of our business in 2007. 20 The following table summarizes our properties under development as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands, except percentage data): Anticipated In Service Date Square Feet Percent Leased Project Costs Anticipated Stabilized Return Held for Rental: 1st Quarter 2007 1,064 19 % $ 116,135 9.60 % 2nd Quarter 2007 559 12 % 60,286 9.13 % 3rd Quarter 2007 2,015 4 % 137,426 9.40 % Thereafter 846 4 % 120,789 9.38 % 4,484 9 % 434,636 9.41 % Service Operations Buildings: 1st Quarter 2007 1,533 51 % 130,947 8.87 % 2nd Quarter 2007 2,684 37 % 122,038 8.72 % 3rd Quarter 2007 1,237 81 % 240,446 8.72 % Thereafter 647 63 % 173,954 8.07 % 6,101 52 % 667,385 8.57 % Total 10,585 34 % $ 1,102,021 8.91 % Acquisition and Disposition Activity: We continued to selectively dispose of non strategic properties in 2006. Sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties were $139.9 million, which included the disposition of our entire portfolio of industrial properties in the Cleveland market. Our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures, of which we have a less than 100% interest, totaled $91.9 million. In 2005, proceeds from the disposition of non strategic properties totaled $1.1 billion for wholly owned held for rental properties, as the result of the Industrial Portfolio Sale, and $31.8 million for our share of property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures. Dispositions of wholly owned properties developed for sale rather than rental resulted in $188.6 million in proceeds in 2006 compared to $121.4 million in 2005. In 2006, we acquired $948.4 million of income producing properties and $436.7 million of undeveloped land compared to $295.6 million of income producing properties and $137.7 million of undeveloped land in 2005. We contributed 23 in service properties from the Mark Winkler portfolio, with a book value of $381.6 million, to two newly formed unconsolidated joint ventures in December 2006. Results of Operations A summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006, is as follows (in thousands, except number of properties and per unit data): 2006 2005 2004 Rental Operations revenues from Continuing Operations $ 818,670 $ 668,607 $ 603,817 Service Operations revenues from Continuing Operations 90,125 81,941 70,803 Earnings from Continuing Rental Operations 127,987 113,746 135,248 Earnings from Continuing Service Operations 53,196 44,278 27,652 Operating income 145,349 127,021 133,421 Net income available for common unitholders 159,799 339,239 167,212 Weighted average common units outstanding 148,069 155,059 155,281 Weighted average common units and potential dilutive common equivalents 149,393 155,877 157,062 Basic income per common unit: Continuing operations $ .70 $ .63 $ .71 Discontinued operations $ .38 $ 1.56 $ .37 Diluted income per common unit: Continuing operation $ .70 $ .63 $ .70 Discontinued operations $ .37 $ 1.55 $ .37 Number of in service properties at end of year 693 660 874 In service square footage at end of year 109,293 97,835 109,635 21 Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Rental Income from Continuing Operations Overall, rental income from continuing operations increased from $639.1 million in 2005 to $780.7 million in 2006. The following table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 (in thousands): 2006 2005 Office $ 562,903 $ 462,939 Industrial 203,259 166,343 Non segment 14,504 9,776 Total $ 780,666 $ 639,058 Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry; however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when applicable, are summarized below: In 2006, we acquired 50 new properties and placed 27 development projects in service. These 2006 acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended 2006 compared to 2005 as they provided incremental revenues of $73.8 million and $9.3 million respectively. These acquisitions totaled $948.4 million on 8.6 million square feet and were 99% leased at December 31, 2006. Acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in 2005 provided $15.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of incremental revenue in 2006. Our in service occupancy increased from 92.7% at December 31, 2005, to 92.9% at December 31, 2006. Rental income includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees increased from $7.3 million in 2005 to $16.1 million in 2006. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These earnings increased from $29.5 million in 2005 to $38.0 million in 2006. During 2006, our joint ventures sold 22 non strategic buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling $18.8 million. During the second quarter of 2005, one of our ventures sold three buildings, with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling $11.1 million. 22 Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively (in thousands): 2006 2005 Rental Expenses: Office $ 151,368 $ 125,093 Industrial 23,745 21,622 Non segment 3,519 1,557 Total $ 178,632 $ 148,272 Real Estate Taxes: Office $ 59,717 $ 53,039 Industrial 23,186 19,979 Non segment 6,012 5,104 Total $ 88,915 $ 78,122 Rental expenses and real estate taxes for 2006 have increased from 2005 by $30.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, as the result of acquisition and development activity in 2005 and 2006 as well as from our increase in occupancy over the past two years. Interest Expense Interest expense increased from $113.1 million in 2005 to $179.0 million in 2006, as a result of the following: Interest expense on the unsecured line of credit increased by $29.2 million from 2005 as the result of increased borrowings throughout the year, as well as increased interest rates. Interest expense on unsecured notes increased by $10.2 million as the result of an overall increase in borrowings used mainly to fund acquisitions and development. Interest expense on secured debt increased by $27.8 million as the result of the increase in borrowings in 2006. Amortization of deferred financing fees increased by $2.4 million as the result of additional borrowings in 2006. Offsetting the above increases, capitalized interest increased by $26.8 million as the result of increased development activity. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization increased from $215.4 million in 2005 to $244.1 million in 2006 as the result of increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments during 2005 and 2006. Service Operations Service Operations primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell within a short period of time and the leasing, management, construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. These operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy, as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations. Service Operations earnings increased from $44.3 million in 2005 to $53.2 million in 2006. The following are the factors related to the increase in Service Operations earnings in 2006. 23 Our Service Operations building development and sales program, whereby a building is developed or repositioned by us and then sold, is a significant component of earnings from service operations. During 2006, we generated pre tax gains of $44.6 million from the sale of nine properties compared to $29.9 million from the sale of ten properties in 2005. Profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold, the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale, such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market. Partially offsetting the increased 2006 gains from our Service Operations building development and sales program was the effect of a decreased focus on third party construction services as well as the fact that in the first quarter of 2005, we recognized $2.7 million of a non recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in 2001. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense increased from $31.0 million in 2005 to $35.8 million in 2006. General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees, external audit fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead. The second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of our owned properties and Service Operations, including construction, leasing and maintenance operations. Overhead costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2005 was largely attributable to an increase in our overall pool of overhead costs to support our current and anticipated future growth. Discontinued Operations The results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations. The property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes, allocated interest expense, depreciation expense and minority interest, as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties. We classified the operations of 308 buildings as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2006. These 308 buildings consist of 273 industrial, 32 office and three retail properties. As a result, we classified net income from operations of $9.3 million, $17.4 million and $31.4 million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of these properties, 21 were sold during 2006, 234 properties were sold during 2005, 41 properties were sold during 2004, and 12 operating properties are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2006. The gains on disposal of these properties, net of impairment adjustment, of $46.3 million, $223.9 million and $26.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are also reported in discontinued operations. 24 Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Rental Income from Continuing Operations Overall, rental income from continuing operations increased from $582.2 million in 2004 to $639.1 million in 2005. The following table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively (in thousands): 2005 2004 Office $ 462,939 $ 419,068 Industrial 166,343 152,989 Non segment 9,776 10,174 Total $ 639,058 $ 582,231 Both of our reportable segments that comprise Rental Operations (office and industrial) are within the real estate industry; however, the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment in the same manner. The primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations, with specific references to a particular segment when applicable, are summarized below: In 2005, we acquired nine new properties and placed 17 development projects in service. These acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the $56.8 million overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended 2005, compared to 2004. The nine property acquisitions provided revenues of $21.0 million. These acquisitions totaled $307.5 million on 2.2 million square feet and were 86.5% leased at December 31, 2005. Revenues from acquisitions that occurred in 2004 totaled $31.8 million in 2005 compared to $13.4 million in 2004. Developments placed in service in 2005 provided revenues of $5.8 million. Revenues from developments placed in service in 2004 increased $9.9 million to $17.4 million in 2005. Our in service occupancy increased from 90.9% at December 31, 2004, to 92.7% at December 31, 2005. Rental income includes lease termination fees. Lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term. Lease termination fees in 2005 continued to steadily decrease as a result of improving market conditions. Lease termination fees decreased from $14.7 million in 2004 to $7.3 million in 2005. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Companies Equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies. These joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. These earnings increased from $21.6 million in 2004 to $29.5 million in 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, one of our ventures sold three buildings with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling $11.1 million. 25 Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes The following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively (in thousands): 2005 2004 Rental Expenses: Office $ 125,093 $ 106,303 Industrial 21,622 19,467 Non segment 1,557 1,213 Total $ 148,272 $ 126,983 Real Estate Taxes: Office $ 53,039 $ 44,245 Industrial 19,979 16,922 Non segment 5,104 4,679 Total $ 78,122 $ 65,846 Rental and real estate tax expenses for 2005, as compared to 2004, have increased as a result of our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions as well as our increase in occupancy. This increase in rental and real estate taxes was in line with our expectations. Interest Expense Interest expense increased from $104.0 million in 2004 to $113.1 million in 2005 largely as the result of increased interest expense from additional unsecured borrowings. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $171.8 million in 2004 to $215.4 million in 2005 as the result of increases in our held for rental base from acquisitions and developments during 2004 and 2005. Service Operations Service Operations primarily consist of building sales and the leasing, management, construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties. These operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations. Service Operations earnings increased from $27.7 million in 2004 to $44.3 million in 2005. The increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs in 2005. Other factors impacting service operations are discussed below. Our Service Operations development and sales program, whereby a building is developed or repositioned by us and then sold, is a significant component of construction and development income. During 2005, we generated pre tax gains of $29.9 million from the sale of 10 properties compared to $24.2 million from the sale of six properties in 2004. Profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold, the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale, such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market. In 2005, we experienced an increase in our third party construction business as evidenced by the increase in general contractor revenues in 2005 over 2004. We achieved a slight increase in our profit margins during 2005, which reflected improved pricing in certain markets and our ability to select more profitable projects as resources are re positioned to our increasing held for investment development pipeline. In the first quarter of 2005, we recognized $2.7 million of a non recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in 2001. The gain was deferred as a result of future performance provisions contained in the original sales agreement. As a result of contract renegotiations effective in the first quarter of 2005, all future performance provisions were removed and the deferred gain was recognized. 26 General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense increased from $29.5 million in 2004 to $31.0 million in 2005. General and administrative expenses consist of two components. The first component is direct expenses not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees, external audit fees, marketing costs, investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead. The second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of our owned properties and Service Operations, including construction, leasing and maintenance operations. Overhead costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in payroll expenses associated with long term compensation plans and an increase in the number of employees to support our overall growth. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions, and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with the General Partners Audit Committee and independent auditors. The following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements, degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions: Accounting for Joint Ventures: We analyze our investments in joint ventures under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation. To the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities, we further assess under the guidelines of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5), Statement of Position 78 9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures; Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements and FASB No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries, to determine if the venture should be consolidated. We have equity interests ranging from 10% 67% in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights. Control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations, refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner. We use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial polices. Under the equity method of accounting, our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet; however, the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet. Cost Capitalization: Direct and certain indirect costs, including interest, clearly associated with and incremental to the development, construction, leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property. We capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry. The interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt. 27 We also capitalize direct and indirect costs, including interest costs, on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. We cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains 90% occupancy. In addition, all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized. In assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized, we first allocate payroll costs, on a department by department basis, among activities for which capitalization is warranted (i.e., construction, development and leasing) and those for which capitalization is not warranted (i.e., property management, maintenance, acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions). To the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities, the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity. Once the payroll costs are allocated, the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs. To ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized, the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed. These standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease. These standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity. The use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized. Impairment of Real Estate Investments: We evaluate our real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations, but not less than annually, to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value. If any real estate investment is considered to be impaired, a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. We utilize the guidelines established under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), to determine if impairment conditions exist. Under SFAS 144, we review the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property. The review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value. In addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows, we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property. These assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved. Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell. Acquisition of Real Estate Property: In accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values. The allocation to tangible assets (buildings, tenant improvements and land) is based upon managements determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. The remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases, the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships. 28 The value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and (ii) managements estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet; both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values, based upon managements assessment of their respective values. These intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease, or the anticipated life of the customer relationship, as applicable. Valuation of Receivables: We are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed. We have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances: We maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk. Various factors such as late rent payments, lease or debt instrument defaults, and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list. As a matter of policy, we reserve the entire receivable balance, including straight line rent, of any tenant with an amount outstanding over 90 days. Straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk, regardless of the status of rent receivables, are reviewed and reserved as necessary. Revenue Recognition on Construction Contracts: We recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method. Using this method, profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts. A portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract. Cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contracts term. This revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes. With regard to critical accounting policies, management has discussed the following with the Audit Committee of the General Partners board of directors: Criteria for identifying and selecting; Methodology in applying; and Impact on the financial statements. The Audit Committee of the General Partner has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months, including payments of dividends and distributions, as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets, primarily through the following: working capital; net cash provided by operating activities; and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 29 Although we historically have not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real estate investments, we may rely on the temporary use of borrowings or property disposition proceeds needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume. We expect to meet long term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities, refinancing of long term debt, preferred equity redemptions, the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility, property acquisitions, financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements, primarily from the following sources: issuance of additional equity, including General Partner common stock and preferred equity; issuance of additional debt securities; undistributed cash provided by operating activities, if any; and proceeds received from real estate dispositions. Rental Operations We believe our principal source of liquidity, cash flows from Rental Operations, provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses. We believe this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition (except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents) as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition. We are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions, as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies, and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties, which would result in reduced cash flow from operations. However, we believe that these risks are mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our locations and the fact that we perform in house credit review and analysis on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed. Credit Facility We had one unsecured line of credit available at December 31, 2006, summarized as follows (in thousands): Borrowing Maturity Interest Outstanding Description Capacity Date Rate at December 31, 2006 Unsecured Line of Credit $ 1,000,000 January 2010 LIBOR + .525 % $ 317,000 We use this line of credit to fund development activities, acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital. The line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line, at rates lower than the stated interest rate, subject to certain restrictions. Interest rates on the amounts outstanding on the unsecured line of credit as of December 31, 2006, ranged from LIBOR +.17% to LIBOR +.525% (equal to 5.52% and 5.875% as of December 31, 2006.) The line of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance, including those related to variable interest indebtedness, consolidated net worth and debt to market capitalization. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our line of credit. Debt and Equity Securities On July 31, 2006, we filed with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. From time to time, we and the General Partner expect to issue additional securities under this new automatic shelf registration statement to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity. 30 On February 18, 2007, the General Partner filed a resale shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with respect to 11,747,135 shares of its common stock issuable upon the exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes. Recipients of such common stock, whom we refer to as the selling shareholders, may use the prospectus filed as part of the resale shelf registration statement to resell, from time to time, the shares of the General Partners common stock that it may issue to them upon the exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes. Additional selling shareholders may be named by future prospectus supplements. The General Partner registered the offering and resale of such shares to allow the selling shareholders to sell any or all of their shares of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange or in private transactions as described in the prospectus. The registration of the shares does not necessarily mean that the selling shareholders will exchange their Exchangeable Notes for the General Partners common stock, that upon any exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes we will elect, in our sole and absolute discretion, to exchange or redeem some or all of the Exchangeable Notes for shares of the General Partners common stock rather than cash, or that any shares of the General Partners common stock received upon exchange or redemption of the Exchangeable Notes will be sold by the selling shareholders under the prospectus or otherwise. The indenture governing our unsecured notes also requires us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2006. Sale of Real Estate Assets We utilize sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity. We pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling sale proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities. Uses of Liquidity Our principal uses of liquidity include the following: Property investments; Recurring leasing/capital costs; Distributions to unitholders; Long term debt maturities; and Other contractual obligations Property Investments We evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook, supply and long term growth potential. Recurring Expenditures One of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the development, acquisition and recurring leasing/capital expenditures of our real estate investments. The following is a summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the year ended December 31 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Tenant improvements $ 41,895 $ 60,633 $ 58,847 Leasing costs 17,106 33,175 27,777 Building improvements 8,122 15,232 21,029 Totals $ 67,123 $ 109,040 $ 107,653 31 Distributions In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the General Partner must currently distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders. We paid distributions per unit of $1.89, $1.87 and $1.85 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also paid a one time special distribution of $1.05 per unit in 2005 as a result of the significant gain realized from the Industrial Portfolio Sale. We expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet the requirements of the General Partner to maintain its REIT status. However, distributions are declared at the discretion of the General Partners board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors, as the General Partners board of directors deems relevant. Debt Maturities Debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, totaled $4.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.77% maturing at various dates through 2028. We had $3.1 billion of unsecured debt, $317.0 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, and $662.5 million of secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. Scheduled principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at December 31, 2006 (in thousands, except percentage data): Future Repayments Weighted Average Scheduled Interest Rate of Year Amortization Maturities Total Future Repayments 2007 13,045 214,615 227,660 5.75% 2008 12,478 273,464 285,942 5.07% 2009 12,185 275,000 287,185 7.36% 2010 11,952 492,000 503,952 5.68% 2011 11,985 1,012,139 1,024,124 5.10% 2012 9,914 201,216 211,130 5.90% 2013 9,905 150,000 159,905 4.74% 2014 9,826 294,534 304,360 6.44% 2015 7,593 5,807 13,400 7.13% 2016 6,671 506,449 513,120 6.17% 2017 4,976 450,000 454,976 5.95% Thereafter 31,676 91,724 123,400 6.49% $ 142,206 $ 3,966,948 $ 4,109,154 5.77% Historical Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $68.2 million and $26.9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating, investing and financing activities (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 275.3 $ 405.4 $ 376.1 Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Investing Activities (1,236.8) 326.9 (427.6) Net Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities 1,002.9 (711.2) 44.6 Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and Service Operations activities. The receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows. In addition, we develop buildings with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion, which provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity. 32 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred Service Operations building development costs of $273.5 million, compared to $83.4 million and $43.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The difference is reflective of the increased activity in our held for sale pipeline. The pipeline of held for sale projects under construction as of December 31, 2006, has anticipated costs of $667.4 million. We sold nine Service Operations buildings in 2006 compared to ten in 2005 and six in 2004, receiving net proceeds of $181.8 million, $113.0 million and $72.7 million, respectively and recognized pre tax gains of $49.0 million, $29.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively. Investing Activities Investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity. Development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements. Highlights of significant cash uses are as follows: Sales of land and depreciated property provided $180.8 million in net proceeds in 2006, compared to $1.1 billion in 2005 and $178.3 million in 2004. In addition, during 2006 we received distributions of $21.2 million for our share of proceeds on the sales of land and depreciable property within three of our joint ventures. The Industrial Portfolio Sale provided $955 million of the $1.1 billion of proceeds received in 2005. We continue to dispose of non strategic and older properties as part of our capital recycling program to fund acquisitions and new developments while improving the overall quality of our investment portfolio. Development costs for our held for rental portfolio increased to $385.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $210.0 million and $145.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management anticipated this continued increase, as a commitment to development activity was part of our strategic plan for 2006 and continues to be for 2007. During 2006, we paid cash of $735.3 million for real estate acquisitions, compared to $285.3 million in 2005 and $204.4 million in 2004. The most significant activity in 2006 consisted of the purchase of the Mark Winkler Portfolio of suburban office and light industrial properties and undeveloped land in the Washington, D.C. area for $867.6 million ($713.5 million paid in cash) and a portfolio of industrial properties in Savannah, Georgia for $196.2 million ($125.9 million paid in cash at closing). In 2006, we paid cash of $435.9 million for undeveloped land, compared to $136.3 million in 2005 and $113.4 million in 2004. These acquisitions provide us greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle. Financing Activities The following significant items highlight fluctuations in net cash provided by financing activities: In January 2006, we received approximately $177.7 million in net proceeds from the General Partners issuance of its Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. This preferred stock bears a dividend yield of 6.95%. We applied a portion of the net proceeds from the Series M preferred equity issuance to redeem $75.0 million of the General Partners Series I preferred shares in February, which had an 8.45% dividend rate. In February 2006, we obtained a $700.0 million secured term loan, which was priced at LIBOR +.525%. The proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of the Mark Winkler Portfolio in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and the loan was secured by these properties. This term loan was paid in full in August 2006 with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured debt as described below. In February and March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due in 2016. A portion of the proceeds were used to retire our $100.0 million 6.72% puttable option reset securities. The remaining cash proceeds were used to fund costs associated with the issuance of debt and to repay amounts outstanding under our line of credit. 33 In June 2006, we received approximately $106.3 million in net proceeds from the General Partners issuance of its Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. This preferred stock bears a dividend yield of 7.25%. In August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due in 2017 and $250.0 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2011. The proceeds from these issuances were used to pay off the $700.0 million secured term loan as described above. In November 2006, we issued $319.0 million of 5.91% debt due in 2016 secured by certain of our in service real estate properties. In November 2006, we issued $575.0 million of Exchangeable Notes, which will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 3.75% per annum and mature in December 2011. In December 2006, we repaid our $250 million LIBOR +.26% Senior Unsecured Notes. Credit Ratings The General Partner and we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Ratings Group. Currently, Fitch and Standard and Poors have assigned a rating of BBB+ and Moodys Investors has assigned a rating of Baa1 to our senior notes. The General Partner and we also received investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on the General Partners preferred stock. Fitch and Standard and Poors have assigned a preferred stock rating of BBB and Moodys Investors has assigned a preferred stock rating of Baa2 to the General Partners preferred stock. These senior notes and preferred stock ratings could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. Financial Instruments We are exposed to capital market risk, such as changes in interest rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk, we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In August 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007. The swaps qualify for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). At December 31, 2006, the fair value of these swaps was approximately $9.9 million in an asset position as the effective rates of the swaps were lower than current interest rates at December 31, 2006. In March 2005, we entered into $300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2006. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting, with any changes in fair value recorded in OCI. In March 2006, we issued $150.0 million of 5.50% senior unsecured notes due 2016 and terminated a corresponding amount of the cash flow hedges designated for this transaction. The settlement amount paid of approximately $800,000 will be recognized to earnings through interest expense ratably over the life of the senior unsecured notes and the ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant. In August 2006, we issued $450.0 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2017 and $250.0 million of 5.63% senior unsecured notes due 2011 and terminated the remaining $150.0 million of cash flow hedges. The settlement amount received of approximately $1.6 million will be recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense ratably over the lives of the senior unsecured notes. The ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant. 34 In June 2004, we simultaneously entered into three forward starting interest rate swaps aggregating $144.3 million, which effectively fixed the rate on financing expected in 2004 at 5.346%, plus our credit spread over the swap rate. The swaps qualified for hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value were recorded in OCI. In August 2004, we settled these three swaps when we issued $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of 6.33%, due in 2014. We paid $6.9 million to unwind the swaps, which is amortized from OCI into interest expense over the life of the new 6.33% senior unsecured notes. The effectiveness of our forward starting hedge instruments will be evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Investments in Unconsolidated Companies We have equity interests ranging from 10% 67% in unconsolidated companies that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development. The equity method of accounting (see Critical Accounting Policies) is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies. As a result, the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet. Our investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represents approximately 9% of our total assets as of December 31, 2006. These investments provide several benefits to us, including increased market share, tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects.

(5) These land acquisitions are subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions. (6) Service contracts defined as those, which cover periods greater than one year and are not cancelable without cause by either party. (7) Represents other contractual obligations. Related Party Transactions We provide property management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, we received from these unconsolidated companies management fees of $4.4 million, $4.8 million and $4.9 million, leasing fees of $2.9 million, $4.3 million and $2.6 million and construction and development fees of $19.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million. We recorded these fees at market rates and eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements. Commitments and Contingencies We have guaranteed the repayment of $79.6 million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments. We will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service. Management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees. We also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of four of our unconsolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on these loans was approximately $129.0 million. Management believes that the value of the real estate exceeds the loan balance and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees. We have entered into agreements, subject to the completion of due diligence requirements, resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions, for the future acquisition of land totaling $36.1 million. 36 In October 2000, we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of $487.0 million to a joint venture (Dugan Realty LLC) in which we have a 50% interest and recognized a net gain of $35.2 million. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a $50.0 million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for the General Partners common stock or cash (at our option), subject to certain timing and other restrictions. As a result of this put option, we deferred $10.2 million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a $50.0 million liability. We renewed all of our major insurance policies in 2006. These policies include coverage for acts of terrorism for our properties. We believe that this insurance provides adequate coverage against normal insurance risks and that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 becomes effective on January 1, 2007 and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our 2007 financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance regarding the process of quantifying the materiality of financial statement misstatements. We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006 with no effect to our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt borrowings. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 37 Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts (in thousands) of the expected annual maturities, weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period, fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.

As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and interest rates.
