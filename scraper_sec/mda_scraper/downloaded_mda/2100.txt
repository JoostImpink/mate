Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In this discussion, the words PPD, we, our and us refer to Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc., together with its subsidiaries where appropriate. Forward looking Statements This Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. Forward looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, expectations, predictions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as might, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, intend, potential or continue, or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates that could be inaccurate and that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results might differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed in Potential Volatility of Quarterly Operating Results and Stock Price and in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Executive Overview Our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients. As a result, we closely monitor the market for our services. For a discussion of the trends affecting our market, see Item 1. Business Trends Affecting the Drug Discovery and Development Industry. Although we cannot predict the demand for CRO services for 2007, we continue to believe that the traditional market drivers for our industry are intact. In the first half of 2006, the market opportunity was robust and we experienced a new high for our global Phase II through IV business from a proposal volume standpoint. During the second half of 2006, proposal volume declined from the record levels in the first half of the year, but our proposal volume remained strong and ahead of 2005 levels. For 2007, we plan to focus our efforts on managing our recent growth and delivering timely, high quality services to our clients, which is fundamental to our business and future growth. We also intend to improve our business development efforts by focusing on the core markets for our services. 33 Table of Contents We believe there are specific opportunities for continued growth in certain areas of our business. Our Global Phase II through IV units had strong operating and financial performance in 2006, and we expect to see continued revenue growth in these units in 2007. Our global central laboratory also achieved strong revenue growth in 2006. We are expanding our service offerings, especially in the area of infectious disease, and investing in new equipment for this business unit. We review various metrics to evaluate our financial performance, including period to period changes in backlog, new authorizations, cancellation rates, revenue, margins and earnings. In 2006, we had new authorizations of $1.971 billion, an increase of 11.6% over 2005. The cancellation rate for 2006 was 19.4%, which is higher than the 16.8% cancellation rate for 2005, but lower than our projected cancellation rate for 2006. The cancellation rate for 2006 was also below our average cancellation rate over the past five years. Backlog grew to $2.238 billion as of December 31, 2006, up 24.4% over December 31, 2005. The average length of our contracts increased to 32.8 months as of December 31, 2006 from 32.1 months as of December 31, 2005. Backlog by client type as of December 31, 2006 was 54.5% pharmaceutical, 32.3% biotech and 13.2% government/other as compared to 49.5% pharmaceutical, 33.3% biotech and 17.2% government/other as of December 31, 2005. The change in the composition of our backlog from 2005 to 2006 is primarily the result of an increase in authorizations from pharmaceutical companies in 2006. Net revenue by client type for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 58.5% pharmaceutical, 29.5% biotech and 12.0% government/other compared to 62.2% pharmaceutical, 27.6% biotech and 10.2% government/other as of December 31, 2005. For 2006, net revenue contribution by service area was 78.0% for Phase II IV services, 15.3% for laboratory services, 3.8% for Phase I clinic and 2.9% for discovery sciences compared to net revenue contribution for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 76.7% for Phase II IV services, 15.0% for laboratory services, 4.2% for discovery sciences and 4.1% for Phase I clinic. Top therapeutic areas by net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 were anti infective/anti viral, oncology, endocrine/metabolic, circulatory/cardiovascular and central nervous system. For a detailed discussion of our revenue, margins, earnings and other financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006, see Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005 versus Year Ended December 31, 2006 below. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $148.0 million. These capital expenditures were primarily for construction costs for our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, computer software and hardware, scientific equipment for our laboratory units, and various building improvements throughout the company. We made these investments to support our growing businesses and to improve the efficiencies of our operations. For 2007, we expect to spend between $105 million and $110 million for capital expenditures, of which approximately $30 million will be related to the ongoing construction of our new headquarters building. The majority of the remaining forecasted capital expenditures will be related to up fit costs for facilities, information technology related expenditures and additional laboratory equipment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $435.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and $75.2 million of debt primarily related to amounts borrowed to finance the construction of our new headquarters building. In 2006, we generated $187.4 million in cash from operations, which was impacted by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services of $99.1 million. The number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services, net of unearned income, also known as DSO, was 44.0 and 34.1 days as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. While DSO increased in part due to the increase in accounts receivable, more than 90% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2006 was less than 60 days old. DSO also rose in 2006 due to longer payment terms with some clients and a decrease in unearned income as a percentage of accounts receivable and unbilled services at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. We expect DSO and unbilled services will continue to fluctuate in the future depending on contract terms, the mix of contracts performed within a quarter, the levels of investigator advances and unearned income, and our success in collecting receivables. Because of our cash position and free cash flow, in late 2005 our Board of Directors declared a special one time cash dividend and adopted a policy to pay annual cash dividends. In October 2006, our Board of Directors amended the annual cash dividend policy to increase the annual dividend rate by 20 percent, from $0.10 to $0.12 per 34 Table of Contents share. The new dividend rate became effective in the fourth quarter of 2006. The cash dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends are not guaranteed and are subject to the discretion of and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the policy remains in the best interests of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. With regards to our Discovery Sciences segment, our preclinical oncology facility had a solid performance in 2006, and is now offering models to support diabetes drug development. Our Discovery Sciences segment also includes our compound partnering arrangements. The DPP4 development program with Takeda Pharmaceuticals continues to progress. With regard to our collaboration on dapoxetine with ALZA Corporation, ALZA has indicated that it may file for approval in Europe as early as late 2007. In February 2007, we exercised an option to license a statin compound from Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. which we intend to develop as a treatment for dyslipidemia. We are solely responsible, and will bear all costs and expenses, for the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of the compound and licensed products. These drug development collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and global drug development expertise to create new opportunities for growth and to share the risks and potential rewards of drug development with our clients. For a background discussion of our compound partnering arrangements, see Item 1. Business Our Services Our Discovery Sciences Group Compound Collaboration Programs. We are committed to our compound partnering strategy and believe it is an innovative way to use our cash resources and drug development expertise to drive mid to long term shareholder value. In 2007, we plan to continue advancing our existing collaborations and evaluate new potential opportunities in this area. Acquisitions In February 2005, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of SurroMed, Inc.s biomarker business. The biomarker business is part of the Discovery Sciences segment. In exchange for the assets, we surrendered to SurroMed for cancellation all shares of preferred stock of SurroMed we held. As additional consideration for the acquisition, we assumed approximately $3.4 million of SurroMed liabilities under capital leases and additional operating liabilities, and guaranteed repayment of up to $1.5 million under a SurroMed bank loan. Our guarantee of this loan expired on December 31, 2006. We recognized a pre tax gain on the exchange of assets with Surromed in the amount of $5.1 million. For further details regarding this acquisition, see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. New Business Authorizations and Backlog New business authorizations, which are sales of our services, are added to backlog when we enter into a contract or letter of intent or receive a verbal commitment. Authorizations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years. We recognize revenue on these authorizations as services are performed. Our new authorizations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were $1.212 billion, $1.766 billion and $1.971 billion, respectively. Our backlog consists of new business authorizations for which the work has not started but is anticipated to begin in the future and contracts in process that have not been completed. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining duration of the contracts in our backlog ranged from one month to 142 months, with an average duration of 32.8 months. Amounts included in backlog represent future revenue and exclude revenue that we have previously recognized. Once work begins on a project included in backlog, we recognize net revenue over the life of the contract as services are performed. Our backlog as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $1.293 billion, $1.799 billion and $2.238 billion, respectively. For various reasons discussed in Item 1. Business Backlog, our backlog might never be recognized as revenue and is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future performance. Results of Operations Revenue Recognition We record revenue from contracts, other than time and material contracts, on a proportional performance basis in our Development and Discovery Sciences segments. To measure performance on a given date, we compare effort expended through that date to estimated total effort to complete the contract. We believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service. Changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized. For time and material contracts in both our Development and Discovery 35 Table of Contents Sciences segments, we recognize revenue as hours are worked, multiplied by the applicable hourly rate. For our Phase I, laboratory and biomarker businesses, we recognize revenue from unitized contracts as subjects or samples are tested, multiplied by the applicable unit price. We offer volume discounts to our large customers based on annual volume thresholds. Revenue is reported net of volume discounts provided to clients. In connection with the management of clinical trials, we pay, on behalf of our clients, fees to investigators and test subjects as well as other out of pocket costs for items such as travel, printing, meetings and couriers and our clients reimburse us for these costs. As required by Emerging Issues Task Force 01 14, amounts paid by us as a principal for out of pocket costs are included in direct costs as reimbursable out of pocket expenses and the reimbursements we receive as a principal are reported as reimbursed out of pocket revenue. In our statements of operations, we combine amounts paid by us as an agent for out of pocket costs with the corresponding reimbursements, or revenue, we receive as an agent. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, fees paid to investigators and other fees we paid as an agent and the associated reimbursements were approximately $226.9 million, $279.8 million and $292.6 million, respectively. Most of our contracts can be terminated by our clients either immediately or after a specified period following notice. These contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early. Therefore, revenue recognized prior to cancellation does not generally require a significant adjustment upon cancellation. If we determine that a loss will result from the performance of a fixed price contract, the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which such determination is made. The Discovery Sciences segment also generates revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments in connection with licensing of compounds. We only recognize milestone payments as revenue if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the client, and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone is not required. Recording of Expenses We generally record our operating expenses among the following categories: direct costs; research and development; selling, general and administrative; depreciation; and amortization. Direct costs consist of amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process, and include direct labor and related benefit charges, other costs directly related to contracts, an allocation of facility and information technology costs, and reimbursable out of pocket expenses. Direct costs, as a percentage of net revenue, tend to and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies being conducted during any period of time. Research and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of patent expenses, labor and related benefit charges associated with personnel performing internal research and development work, supplies associated with this work, consulting services and an allocation of facility and information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges, sales, advertising and promotional expenses, recruiting and relocation expenses, training costs, administrative travel, an allocation of facility and information technology costs, and costs related to operational employees performing administrative tasks. Depreciation expenses consist of depreciation costs recorded on a straight line method, based on estimated useful lives of 40 to 50 years for buildings, five years for laboratory equipment, two to five years for software, computers and related equipment, and five to ten years for furniture and equipment, except for aircrafts, which we depreciate over 30 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the relevant lease or the useful life of the improvement. We depreciate property under capital leases over the life of the lease or the service life, whichever is shorter. 36 Table of Contents Amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on intangible assets on a straight line method over the life of the intangible assets. Year Ended December 31, 2005 versus Year Ended December 31, 2006 The following table sets forth amounts from our consolidated financial statements along with the dollar and percentage change for the full year of 2005 compared to the full year of 2006. Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2005 2006 $ Inc (Dec) % Inc (Dec) Net revenue: Development $ 921,802 $ 1,113,106 $ 191,304 20.8 % Discovery Sciences 40,214 33,193 (7,021 ) (17.5 ) Reimbursed out of pockets 75,074 101,383 26,309 35.0 Total net revenue 1,037,090 1,247,682 210,592 20.3 Direct costs: Development 467,001 559,819 92,818 19.9 Discovery Sciences 8,428 9,324 896 10.6 Reimbursable out of pocket expenses 75,074 101,383 26,309 35.0 Total direct costs 550,503 670,526 120,023 21.8 Research and development expenses 23,370 5,406 (17,964 ) (76.9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 251,095 302,536 51,441 20.5 Depreciation 39,127 47,175 8,048 20.6 Amortization 1,123 563 (560 ) (49.9 ) Loss on impairment and disposal of assets 320 1,499 1,179 368.4 Gain on exchange of assets (5,144 ) 5,144 (100.0 ) Income from operations 176,696 219,977 43,281 24.5 Impairment of equity investments (5,928 ) 5,928 (100.0 ) Interest and other income, net 9,035 15,528 6,493 71.9 Income before provision for income taxes 179,803 235,505 55,702 31.0 Provision for income taxes 59,906 78,853 18,947 31.6 Net income $ 119,897 $ 156,652 $ 36,755 30.7 Net income per diluted share $ 1.03 $ 1.32 $ 0.29 28.2 Total net revenue increased $210.6 million to $1.248 billion in 2006. The increase in total net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our Development segment revenue. The Development segment generated net revenue of $1.113 billion, which accounted for 89.2% of total net revenue for 2006. The 20.8% increase in Development net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the level of global CRO Phase II through IV services we provided in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Discovery Sciences segment generated net revenue of $33.2 million in 2006, a decrease of $7.0 million from 2005. The higher 2005 Discovery Sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to the $10.0 million milestone payment from ALZA Corporation we received in 2005 for the filing of the dapoxetine NDA. This was partially offset by increased revenue generated by our preclinical oncology division in 2006 as compared to 2005. We received a $15.0 million milestone from Takeda in connection with the DPP4 collaboration in both 2005 and 2006. We do not expect to receive any milestone payments related to either of these collaborations in 2007. 37 Table of Contents Total direct costs increased $120.0 million to $670.5 million in 2006 primarily as the result of an increase in the Development segment direct costs. Development direct costs increased $92.8 million to $559.8 million in 2006. The primary reason for this was an increase in personnel costs of $80.8 million due to over 1,000 additional employees in our global Phase II through IV division. The remaining increase in the development direct costs is primarily due to increased facility costs of $11.2 million related to the increase in personnel. R&D expenses decreased $18.0 million to $5.4 million in 2006. R&D expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreased spending in connection with the DPP4 program, which was transferred to Takeda. Under the DPP4 agreement with Takeda that we entered into in July 2005, Takeda assumed the obligation to fund all future development and commercialization costs of the DPP4 inhibitor program. In February 2007, we exercised an option to license a statin compound from Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. which we intend to develop as a treatment for dyslipidemia. We are solely responsible, and will bear all costs and expenses, for the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of the compound and licensed products. We plan to continue evaluating other compound partnering opportunities to drive mid and long term shareholder value. As a result of this new collaboration and any other compound partnering transaction that we might enter into in 2007, our R&D expense could increase. SG&A expenses increased $51.4 million to $302.5 million in 2006. As a percentage of total net revenue, SG&A expenses were 24.2% in both 2005 and 2006. The increase in SG&A expenses includes additional personnel costs of $40.7 million. The increase in personnel costs related mainly to an increased level of new hires of both operations infrastructure and administrative personnel to support expanding operations and revenue growth. The increase in SG&A costs also includes an additional $3.2 million related to additional provisions for bad debt expense. In addition, SG&A costs include an increase of $2.0 million in accounting and legal fees. Depreciation expense increased $8.0 million to $47.2 million in 2006. The increase was related to property and equipment we acquired to accommodate our growth, a significant portion of which related to information technology system investments we made in 2005. Capital expenditures were $148.0 million in 2006. Capital expenditures included $73.5 million for our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, $23.4 million for computer software and hardware, $16.1 million related to leasehold improvements at various sites, $8.9 million for additional scientific equipment for our Phase I and laboratory units and $8.7 million for our new building in Scotland. We expect depreciation to increase in 2007 as a result of substantial investments over the past couple years in information technology systems to support our global Phase II IV business and the additional depreciation related to our new corporate headquarters building. Income from operations increased $43.3 million to $220.0 million in 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, income from operations increased from 17.0% in 2005 to 17.6% in 2006. Income from operations in 2006 included a significant decrease in R&D expenses as discussed above and a $1.5 million loss on disposal of assets, mostly composed of $0.8 million related to disposal of assets in our biomarker business, $0.2 million related to the disposal of an intangible asset and a $0.4 million impairment related to the value of our building in Leicester, United Kingdom, which was the site of our former U.K. Phase I operations. Income from operations in 2006 was negatively impacted by approximately $3.3 million due to foreign currency fluctuation, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the pound sterling, euro and Brazilian real. Although these currency movements increased net revenue in the aggregate, the negative impact on income from operations is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the United States. In these cases, revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, but the costs associated with performing these contracts and maintaining the foreign infrastructure, which are paid in local currency, increase when translated to U.S. dollars, resulting in lower operating profits. During 2006, we recorded a foreign currency hedging loss of $0.3 million, resulting in a net impact to income from operations of $3.6 million attributable to foreign currency transactions. Income from operations in 2005 included a $5.1 million gain on exchange of assets associated with the acquisition of SurroMeds biomarker business. Income from operations in 2005 also included a $10.0 million milestone payment related to the filing of the dapoxetine NDA. During 2005, we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our cost basis investments of $5.6 million, which included $1.6 million related to the outstanding balance of a revolving line of credit that was guaranteed by us, and our marketable equity securities of $0.3 million. The write downs were due to a business failure, current fair market values, historical and projected performance and liquidity needs of the investees. 38 Table of Contents Interest and other income, net increased $6.5 million to $15.5 million in 2006. This was due primarily to increased interest income due to higher interest rates and a 28.2% increase in our average cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balance. Our provision for income taxes increased $18.9 million to $78.9 million in 2006. Our effective income tax rate for 2005 was 33.3% compared to 33.5% for 2006. The effective tax rate for 2006 was positively impacted by 1.8% by the recognition of benefit for state economic development tax credits as well as a decrease in liabilities for tax contingencies and a decrease in the valuation allowance due to the closing of certain state tax statutes and audits. The effective tax rate for 2005 was positively impacted by a $6.9 million reduction in our valuation allowance provided for the deferred tax asset relating to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction was a result of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards that previously had a valuation allowance recorded against them as well as the recognition of capital gains for the dapoxetine NDA milestone payment from ALZA Corporation received in the first quarter of 2005 and the $15.0 million up front payment received from Takeda during the third quarter of 2005 with respect to the DPP4 program. This reduction in the valuation allowance decreased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 3.5%. The remaining difference in our effective tax rates for 2006 compared to 2005 is due to the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 and the change in the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. Net income of $156.7 million in 2006 represents an increase of 30.7% from $119.9 million in 2005. Net income per diluted share of $1.32 in 2006 represents a 28.2% increase from $1.03 net income per diluted share in 2005. Net income per diluted share for 2005 included $0.03 per share, net of tax, for the gain on exchange of assets associated with the acquisition of SurroMeds biomarker business which was offset by $0.03 per share, net of tax, for impairment of equity investments. 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004 versus Year Ended December 31, 2005 The following table sets forth amounts from our consolidated financial statements along with the dollar and percentage change for the full year of 2004 compared to the full year of 2005. (in thousands, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 $ Inc (Dec) % Inc (Dec) Net revenue: Development $ 759,629 $ 921,802 $ 162,173 21.3 % Discovery Sciences 14,311 40,214 25,903 181.0 Reimbursed out of pockets 67,316 75,074 7,758 11.5 Total net revenue 841,256 1,037,090 195,834 23.3 Direct costs: Development 379,211 467,001 87,790 23.2 Discovery Sciences 6,226 8,428 2,202 35.4 Reimbursable out of pocket expenses 67,316 75,074 7,758 11.5 Total direct costs 452,753 550,503 97,750 21.6 Research and development expenses 15,852 23,370 7,518 47.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 203,218 251,095 47,877 23.6 Depreciation 28,609 39,127 10,518 36.8 Amortization 1,245 1,123 (122 ) (9.8 ) Loss on disposal of assets 201 320 119 59.2 Gain on exchange of assets (5,144 ) (5,144 ) Restructuring charges 2,619 (2,619 ) (100.0 ) Income from operations 136,759 176,696 39,937 29.2 Impairment of equity investments (2,000 ) (5,928 ) (3,928 ) 196.4 Interest and other income, net 3,830 9,035 5,205 135.9 Income before provision for income taxes 138,589 179,803 41,214 29.7 Provision for income taxes 46,905 59,906 13,001 27.7 Net income $ 91,684 $ 119,897 $ 28,213 30.8 Net income per diluted share $ 0.81 $ 1.03 $ 0.22 27.2 Total net revenue increased $195.8 million to $1.037 billion in 2005. The increase in total net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in our Development segment revenue. The Development segment generated net revenue of $921.8 million, which accounted for 88.9% of total net revenue for 2005. The 21.3% increase in Development net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the level of global CRO Phase II through IV services we provided in 2005 as compared to 2004. The Discovery Sciences segment generated net revenue of $40.2 million in 2005, an increase of $25.9 million from 2004. The increase in the Discovery Sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to the $15.0 million up front payment we received from Takeda in connection with the DPP4 agreement we entered into in July 2005 and the $10.0 million milestone payment we received from ALZA for the filing of the dapoxetine NDA. The remaining increase was primarily due to revenue generated by our biomarker business that we acquired from SurroMed. In 2004, we received a $5.0 million payment from ALZA in connection with an amendment to the dapoxetine out license agreement. 40 Table of Contents Total direct costs increased $97.8 million to $550.5 million in 2005 primarily as the result of an increase in the Development segment direct costs. Development direct costs increased $87.8 million to $467.0 million in 2005. The primary reason for this increase was an increase in personnel costs of $67.6 million due to hiring additional employees in our global CRO Phase II through IV division and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. The remaining $20.2 million of this increase in Development direct costs primarily consisted of increased facility costs and higher subcontractor costs to support the growth in the global CRO Phase II through IV division. Discovery Sciences direct costs increased $2.2 million to $8.4 million in 2005. The higher costs in 2005 related primarily to additional direct costs associated with the biomarker business acquired from SurroMed in February 2005. R&D expenses increased $7.5 million to $23.4 million in 2005. R&D expenses increased primarily as a result of increased spending in the first half of the year in connection with the DPP4 program with Takeda, including a $2.5 million milestone payment made by us as a result of the commencement of the Phase II studies in April 2005. Based on the new DPP4 agreement with Takeda entered into in July 2005, Takeda is responsible for future development and commercialization costs for the DPP4 program. Thus, we do not expect to incur any material future R&D expense for the DPP4 program. SG&A expenses increased $47.9 million to $251.1 million in 2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, SG&A expenses were 24.2% in both 2004 and 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses includes additional personnel costs of $31.0 million. The increase in personnel costs related mainly to training costs for new personnel, higher levels of operations infrastructure to manage direct personnel and changes in utilization levels. The increase in SG&A costs also includes an increase of $5.1 million in travel costs due to training initiatives for new and existing operations personnel and higher administrative travel expense. In addition, SG&A costs include $4.7 million in recruiting costs to hire additional personnel and an increase of $2.8 million in facility costs related to the increase in personnel. Depreciation expense increased $10.5 million to $39.1 million in 2005. The increase was related to the depreciation of the property and equipment we acquired to accommodate our growth. Capital expenditures were $109.9 million in 2005. Capital expenditures included $30.5 million for our new corporate aircraft, $18.0 million for our new corporate headquarters facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, $20.6 million for computer software and hardware and $14.7 million for additional scientific equipment for our Phase I and laboratory units. In 2004, we recorded a $2.6 million restructuring charge associated with exiting our chemistry facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. These charges include lease payments and termination costs, net of sublease rentals, of approximately $2.1 million and a loss on sale of assets used in our chemistry services of approximately $0.5 million. The lease termination liability will be paid over the remaining life of the lease, which expires in 2015. Income from operations increased $39.9 million to $176.7 million in 2005. As a percentage of net revenue, income from operations increased from 16.3% in 2004 to 17.0% in 2005. Income from operations in 2005 included a $15.0 million up front payment from Takeda in connection with the DPP4 agreement, a $10.0 million milestone payment related to the filing of the dapoxetine NDA and a $5.1 million gain on exchange of assets associated with the acquisition of SurroMeds biomarker business. Income from operations in 2005 was negatively impacted by the increase in R&D expenses discussed above and by approximately $3.3 million due to foreign currency fluctuation, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and Brazilian real. Although these currency movements increased net revenue in the aggregate, the negative impact on income from operations is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the United States. In these cases, revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, but the costs associated with performing these contracts and maintaining the foreign infrastructure, which are paid in local currency, increase when translated to U.S. dollars resulting in lower operating profits. During 2005, we recorded a foreign currency hedging loss of $1.7 million, resulting in a net impact to income from operations of $5.0 million attributable to foreign currency transactions. Income from operations in 2004 includes a $5.0 million dapoxetine milestone payment from ALZA and the $2.6 million restructuring charge discussed above. 41 Table of Contents During 2005, we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our cost basis investments of $5.6 million, which included $1.6 million related to the outstanding balance of a revolving line of credit that was guaranteed by us, and our marketable equity securities of $0.3 million. The write downs were due to a business failure, current fair market values, historical and projected performance and liquidity needs of the investees. During 2004, we recorded a charge to earnings for an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of an investment of $2.0 million. We deemed our investment to be impaired as a result of the issuance of shares to new investors at a lower valuation than our original investment. Our provision for income taxes increased $13.0 million to $59.9 million in 2005. Our effective income tax rate for 2004 was 33.8% compared to 33.3% for 2005. The effective tax rate for 2005 was positively impacted by a $6.9 million reduction in our valuation allowance provided for the deferred tax asset relating to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction was a result of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards that previously had a valuation allowance recorded against them as well as the recognition of capital gains for the dapoxetine NDA milestone payment from ALZA Corporation received in the first quarter of 2005 and the $15.0 million up front payment received from Takeda during the third quarter of 2005 with respect to the DPP4 program. This reduction in the valuation allowance decreased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 3.5%. During 2004, our effective tax rate was positively impacted by the $3.7 million tax benefit which we recorded as a result of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards that previously had a valuation allowance recorded against them. The remaining difference in our effective rates for 2004 and 2005 is due to the change in the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates. Net income of $119.9 million in 2005 represents an increase of $28.2 million from $91.7 million in 2004. Net income per diluted share of $1.03 in 2005 represents a 27.2% increase from net income per diluted share of $0.81 in 2004. Net income per diluted share for 2005 included $0.03 per share, net of tax, for the gain on exchange of assets associated with the acquisition of SurroMeds biomarker business which was offset by $0.03 per share, net of tax, for impairment of equity investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2006, we had $179.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $255.9 million of short term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents are invested in financial instruments that are rated A or better by Standard & Poors or Moodys and earn interest at market rates. Our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures, including our new corporate headquarters facility, repayment of the construction debt, expansion of services, possible acquisitions, investments and compound partnering collaborations, geographic expansion, dividends, working capital and other general corporate purposes. We have historically funded our operations, dividends and growth, including acquisitions, primarily with cash flow from operations. In the first quarter of 2006, we entered into a construction loan to finance the construction of our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. In 2006, our operating activities provided $187.4 million in cash as compared to $182.1 million for the same period last year. The increase in cash flow from operations is due to a combination of increases and decreases in various line items of our cash flow statement. The primary increases in cash flow were due to a $36.8 million increase in net income, an increase in cash provided by unearned income of $16.0 million and an increase in the cash provided by the provision for deferred taxes of $13.3 million. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash flow as a result of an increase in the cash used for increased receivables of $54.2 million and the decrease in cash provided by accrued income taxes of $23.9 million. Fluctuations in receivables and unearned income occur on a regular basis as we perform services, achieve milestones or other billing criteria, send invoices to clients and collect outstanding accounts receivable. Such activity varies by individual client and contract. In 2006, we used $265.7 million in cash related to investing activities. We used cash to purchase available for sale investments of $680.3 million, make capital expenditures of $148.0 million and purchase other investments of $1.8 million. These amounts were partially offset by maturities and sales of available for sale investments of $562.1 million, proceeds from the sale of an investment of $1.5 million and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $0.9 million. Our capital expenditures in 2006 primarily consisted of $73.5 million for 42 Table of Contents our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, $23.4 million for computer software and hardware, $16.1 million related to leasehold improvements at various sites, $8.9 million for additional scientific equipment for our Phase I and laboratory units and $8.7 million for our new building in Scotland. We expect our capital expenditures in 2007 will be approximately $105 million to $110 million, of which approximately $30 million will be related to the ongoing construction of our new headquarters building. The majority of the remaining forecasted capital expenditures are related to the up fit costs for facilities of approximately $30 million, information technology expenditures and additional laboratory equipment. In 2006, our financing activities provided $71.9 million in cash. We received $74.8 million in borrowings under our construction loan, $28.3 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and $5.4 million in income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and disqualifying dispositions of stock. These amounts were partially offset by repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $17.1 million, dividend payments of $12.3 million, repayments of $6.0 million on long term debt and repayments of capital lease obligations of $1.3 million. The following table sets forth amounts from our consolidated balance sheet affecting our working capital along with the dollar amount of the change from 2005 to 2006. (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 $ Inc (Dec) Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 182,000 $ 179,795 $ (2,205 ) Short term investments 137,820 255,876 118,056 Accounts receivable and unbilled services, net 303,386 408,917 105,531 Income tax receivable 14 510 496 Investigator advances 13,578 13,490 (88 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 34,651 36,495 1,844 Deferred tax assets 11,435 13,119 1,684 Total current assets $ 682,884 $ 908,202 $ 225,318 Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 10,363 $ 15,235 $ 4,872 Payables to investigators 43,126 43,717 591 Accrued income taxes 18,099 16,560 (1,539 ) Other accrued expenses 119,304 149,027 29,723 Deferred tax liabilities 85 86 1 Unearned income 162,662 195,707 33,045 Current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations 1,607 75,159 73,552 Total current liabilities $ 355,246 $ 495,491 $ 140,245 Working capital $ 327,638 $ 412,711 $ 85,073 Working capital as of December 31, 2006 was $412.7 million, compared to $327.6 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in working capital was due primarily to the increase in short term investments and accounts receivable and unbilled services. These increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable, other accrued expenses, unearned income and current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations. The number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services, net of unearned income, also known as DSO, increased to 44.0 days for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 34.1 days for the year ended December 31, 2005. We calculate DSO by dividing accounts receivable and unbilled services less unearned income by average daily gross revenue for the applicable period. Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, as of December 31, 2006 were $267.5 million. While DSO increased in part due to the increase 43 Table of Contents in accounts receivable, more than 90% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2006 was less than 60 days old. Unearned income as of December 31, 2006 was $195.7 million, which represented 47.9% of our accounts receivable and unbilled services balance. This percentage has decreased from December 31, 2005 when our unearned income of $162.7 million represented 53.6% of our accounts receivable and unbilled services balance. This decrease in unearned income as a percentage of receivables and unbilled services caused DSO to increase. DSO also rose in 2006 due to longer payment terms with some clients. We expect DSO will continue to fluctuate in the future depending on contract terms, the mix of contracts performed within a quarter, the levels of investigator advances and unearned income, and our success in collecting receivables. We maintain a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees in the United Kingdom. This pension plan was closed to new participants as of December 31, 2002. The projected benefit obligation for the benefit plan at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, was $41.8 million and $51.8 million, respectively, and the value of the plan assets was $29.3 million and $40.9 million, respectively. As a result, the plan was under funded by $12.5 million in 2005 and by $10.8 million in 2006, respectively. The amount of contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 were $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. It is likely that the amount of our contributions to the plan could increase in future years. We expect the pension cost to be recognized in our financial statements will decrease slightly from the $2.9 million in 2006 to approximately $2.1 million in 2007. The expense to be recognized in future periods could increase or decrease depending upon the change in the fair market value of the plan assets and changes in the projected benefit obligation. A decrease in the market value of plan assets and or declines in interest rates are likely to cause the amount of the under funded status to increase. After completion of the actuarial valuations in 2007, we could be required to record an additional reduction to shareholders equity. In connection with the plan, we recorded a reduction to shareholders equity in 2005 of $1.6 million and an increase to shareholders equity in 2006 of $2.8 million, offset by a decrease of $3.3 million due to the adoption of SFAS No. 158. Given the impact that the discount rate and stock market performance have on the projected benefit obligation and market value of plan assets, future changes in either one of these factors could significantly reduce or increase the amount of our pension plan under funding. In July 2006, we renewed our $50.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N. A. Indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios and restrictions on certain types of transactions. This revolving credit facility does not expressly restrict or limit the payment of dividends, and we do not expect any of the covenants to affect our ability to pay dividends under our cash dividend policy for the foreseeable future. We were in compliance with all loan covenants as of December 31, 2006. Outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual fluctuating rate equal to the one month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.6%. Borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes. This credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in June 2007, at which time any outstanding balance will be due. As of December 31, 2006, no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility, although the aggregate amount we are able to borrow had been reduced by $1.3 million due to outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility. As of February 15, 2007, we had borrowed approximately $25.0 million under this facility. In February 2006, we entered into an $80.0 million construction loan facility with Bank of America, N.A. This construction loan facility is in addition to the $50.0 million revolving credit facility discussed above. Indebtedness under the construction loan facility is unsecured and is subject to the same covenants as the revolving credit facility and additional covenants commonly used in construction loan agreements. In addition, we must maintain at least $50.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments while the loan is outstanding. We were in compliance with all loan covenants as of December 31, 2006. Borrowings under this credit facility are available to finance the construction of our new corporate headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina and bear interest at an annual fluctuating rate equal to the one month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.6%. Interest on amounts borrowed under this construction loan facility is payable quarterly. This credit facility has a term of two years and will mature in February 2008, at which time the entire principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due. As of December 31, 2006, we had borrowed approximately $74.8 million under this facility. We expect to pay off this construction loan in full within the next 12 months and thus have shown this as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. 44 Table of Contents On October 3, 2005, our Board of Directors adopted a cash dividend policy. We paid the first quarterly cash dividend under our dividend policy in the fourth quarter of 2005, and in each of the first three quarters of 2006, we paid a similar dividend of $0.025 per share. In October 2006, our Board of Directors amended the annual cash dividend policy to increase the annual dividend rate by 20 percent, from $0.10 to $0.12 per share, payable quarterly at a rate of $0.03 per share. The new dividend rate was effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. The cash dividend policy and the payment of future quarterly cash dividends under that policy are not guaranteed and are subject to the discretion of and continuing determination by our Board of Directors that the policy remains in the best interests of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. In September 2005, we became a limited partner in Bay City Capital Fund IV, L.P., a venture capital fund formed to invest in life sciences companies. We have committed to invest up to a maximum of $10.0 million in this fund. Aggregate capital calls through December 31, 2006 totaled $3.2 million. Because no capital call can exceed 20% of our aggregate capital commitment, we anticipate that our remaining capital commitment of $6.8 million will be invested through a series of future capital calls over the next several years. Our capital commitment will expire in June 2009. In November 2003, we became a limited partner in A. M. Pappas Life Science Ventures III, L.P., a venture capital fund formed to invest in life sciences, healthcare and technology industries. We have committed to invest up to a maximum of $4.8 million in this fund. Aggregate capital calls through December 31, 2006 totaled $1.2 million. Because no capital call can exceed 10% of our aggregate capital commitment, we anticipate that our remaining capital commitment of $3.6 million will be invested through a series of future capital calls over the next several years. Our capital commitment will expire in May 2009. As of December 31, 2006, we had liabilities of $9.1 million for certain unsettled matters in connection with tax positions taken on our tax returns, including interpretations of applicable income tax laws and regulations. We establish a reserve when, despite managements belief that our tax returns reflect the proper treatment of all matters, the treatment of certain tax matters is likely to be challenged. Significant judgment is required to evaluate and adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. Further, a number of years may lapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, management believes that the reserves of $9.1 million reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We believe it is unlikely that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We have been involved in compound development and commercialization collaborations since 1997. We developed a risk sharing research and development model to help pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients develop compounds. Through collaborative arrangements based on this model, we assist our clients by sharing the risks and potential rewards associated with the development and commercialization of drugs at various stages of development. We currently have four such arrangements that involve the potential future receipt of one or more of the following: payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones; royalty payments if the compound is approved for sale; sales based milestone payments; and a share of net sales up to a specified dollar limit. The compounds that are the subject of these collaborations are still in development and have not been approved for sale in any country. Our collaboration with ALZA Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, for dapoxetine requires us to pay a royalty to Eli Lilly & Company of 5% on annual net sales of the compound in excess of $800 million. ALZA received a not approvable letter from the FDA in October 2005, but has continued its global development program and has indicated that it may file for approval in Europe as early as late 2007. As a result of the risks associated with drug development, including obtaining regulatory approval to sell in any country, the receipt of any further milestone payments, royalties or other payments is uncertain. During the first quarter of 2006, we earned a $15.0 million milestone payment under our DPP4 collaboration with Takeda. Under most of our agreements for Development services, we typically agree to indemnify and defend the sponsor against third party claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct. Any successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 45 Table of Contents We expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth, strategic acquisitions and investments. We expect to fund these activities and the payment of future cash dividends from existing cash, cash flows from operations and, if necessary or appropriate, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and dividends for the foreseeable future. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions, investments and other growth opportunities that might require additional external financing, and we might seek funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, our sources of liquidity and ability to pay dividends could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients; compliance with regulations; international risks; breach of contract, personal injury or other tort claims; environmental or intellectual property claims; or other factors described under Item 1A. Risk Factors, in this Item 7 under the subheadings Contractual Obligations, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Potential Liability and Insurance, Potential Volatility of Quarterly Operating Results and Stock Price and under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2006, future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 andthereafter Total Long term debt $ 74,833 $ $ $ $ 74,833 Capital leases, including interest payments 335 335 Operating leases 44,213 74,807 56,028 81,119 256,167 Less: sublease income (1,681 ) (3,477 ) (3,405 ) (5,096 ) (13,659 ) Total $ 117,700 $ 71,330 $ 52,623 $ 76,023 $ 317,676 As noted above, we became a limited partner in two venture capital funds. Under the terms of our agreement with the Bay City Capital Fund IV, L.P., we committed to invest up to an aggregate of approximately $10.0 million in the fund. Under the terms of our agreement with the A. M. Pappas Life Science Ventures III, L.P., we committed to invest up to an aggregate of $4.8 million. We anticipate that our aggregate investment in both of these funds will be made through a series of future capital calls over the next several years. We also have a long term liability on our balance sheet regarding the underfunding of our U.K. pension plan in the amount of $10.8 million. We do not know if or when this will be funded because this liability will change based on the performance of the investments of the plan and changes in the benefit obligations. We anticipate spending approximately $30 million in 2007 on the construction of our new headquarters building and related parking facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. Also, in February 2007, we exercised an option to license a statin compound from Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. which we intend to develop as a treatment for dyslipidemia. We are solely responsible, and will bear all costs and expenses, for the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of the compound and licensed products. We are also obligated to pay Ranbaxy milestone payments upon the occurrence of specified clinical development events. If a licensed product is approved for sale, we must also pay Ranbaxy royalties based on sales of such product and commercial milestone payments based on the achievement of specified worldwide sales targets. If all criteria are met, the total amount of potential clinical and sales based milestones over the development and commercialization period would be $44 million. Off balance Sheet Arrangements As part of the acquisition of SurroMeds assets, we agreed to guarantee repayment of up to $1.5 million under a SurroMed bank loan with a maturity date of December 31, 2006. Our guarantee expired on December 31, 2006 and we have no further liability under the guarantee. In January 2005, we guaranteed an $8.0 million loan from Bank of America to Almont Shipping Company in connection with the purchase of property from Almont. We subsequently purchased the secured note and all related loan documents from Bank of America and refinanced the note with a new buyer who paid off the note in December 2006. As of December 31, 2006, no guarantee was outstanding related to this transaction. From time to time, we cause letters of credit to be issued to provide credit support for guarantees, contractual commitments and insurance policies. The fair values of the letters of credit reflect the amount of the underlying obligation and are subject to fees competitively determined in the marketplace. As of December 31, 2006, we had four letters of credit outstanding for a total of $1.3 million. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We believe that the following are the primary areas in which management must make significant judgments in applying our accounting policies to determine our financial condition and results of operations. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the Finance and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenues are recorded from contracts on a proportional performance basis. To measure performance on a given date, we compare effort expended through that date to estimated total effort to complete the contract. We believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service. Direct costs are primarily comprised of labor and overhead related to the delivery of services. Each month we accumulate direct costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the percentage of completion. We then multiply this percentage by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized. Each month we review the total current estimated direct costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and, if necessary, we adjust the total estimated direct costs for each project. As the work progresses, we might determine that our original estimates for direct costs were incorrect due to, among other things, revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate, and a contract modification might be negotiated with the client to cover additional costs. If a contract modification is not agreed to, we could bear the risk of cost overruns. In 2006 and prior years, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects, resulting in lower gross margins on those projects. We might experience similar situations in the future. Changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined. Should our estimated direct costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low, future gross margins on these projects could be materially adversely affected, absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification. We accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process. Historically, the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct, but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future. A hypothetical increase to total estimated remaining project direct costs of 1% for open projects accounted for under the proportional performance method as of December 31, 2006 would have resulted in a cumulative reduction in revenue of approximately $3.3 million for 2006. In our Discovery Sciences segment, we generate revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments in connection with licensing of compounds. We only recognize milestone payments as revenue if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the client, and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required. Future potential milestone payments under various discovery contracts might never be received if the milestones are not achieved. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Included in Accounts receivable and unbilled services, net on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts. Generally, before we do business with a new client, we perform a credit check. We also review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts includes specific accounts and an estimate of other losses based on historical loss experience. After all attempts to collect the receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available to us, we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2006 was adequate to cover uncollectible balances. However, actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve. Investments Our investments consist of equity and debt investments in publicly traded and privately held entities. Our investments in publicly traded securities are classified as available for sale securities and recorded at their current 47 Table of Contents quoted market price. Our investments in privately held entities do not have readily determinable fair values and are, therefore, recorded using the cost method of accounting. Most of our investments are in relatively early stage life sciences and biotechnology companies or investment funds that invest in similar companies. These early stage life sciences and biotechnology companies generally do not have established products or proven technologies or material revenue, if any. The fair value of these investments might from time to time be less than their recorded value. We assess our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for other than temporary impairments. For our investments in privately held entities, we must identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. In addition, any decline in the fair value of publicly traded or privately held investments must be evaluated to determine the extent and timing of recovery, if any. If we deem the impairment to be other than temporary, the impairment of the investment must be recorded in the income statement. This quarterly review includes an evaluation of, among other things, the market condition of the overall industry, historical and projected financial performance and market values, the status of the companys development and commercialization efforts, expected cash needs and recent funding events. This analysis of the fair values and the extent and timing of recoveries of decreases in fair value requires significant judgment. Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Liabilities Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating losses, tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. In determining future taxable income, assumptions include the amount of state, federal and international pre tax income from operations, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Based on our analysis of the above factors, we determined that a valuation allowance of $5.6 million was required as of December 31, 2006 for carryforwards of foreign and state tax losses and credits. Changes in our assumptions could result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance, up or down, in the future. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. As of December 31, 2006, we had recorded $9.1 million for certain unsettled tax matters. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment, a tax expense or benefit to expense, respectively, would result. Long Lived Assets We review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. These undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgments and assumptions. Additionally, we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the underlying reporting units goodwill to their estimated fair value. These tests for impairment of goodwill involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated, and are inherently subjective. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised) using the modified retrospective application method. Accordingly, we measure stock based compensation cost at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, 48 Table of Contents and recognize it as expense over the employees requisite service period. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of the following assumptions: an expected dividend yield; expected volatility; risk free interest rate; and expected term. Based on our assumptions for these factors, the weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $15.36 per option. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the weighted average fair value of options. For example, if we changed our assumption for the expected term to increase expected life by a half of a year, the weighted average fair value of options granted during 2006 would have increased by $0.77 or 5.0% from $15.36 to $16.13, and the resulting stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for stock option awards, net of related tax effect, would have increased by $0.1 million. Diluted earnings per share under this example would not have been impacted. See Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the assumptions used in estimating fair value for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 regarding our equity compensation plan and our employee stock purchase plan.

Our profits are also impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various tax jurisdictions. In particular, as the geographic mix of our pretax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes, our effective tax rate might vary from period to period. Inflation Our long term contracts, those in excess of one year, generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date. In the event that actual inflation rates are greater than our contractual inflation rates or cost of living adjustments, inflation could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Potential Liability and Insurance Drug development services involve the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol. This testing exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from, among other things, possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug. Many of these patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death. We attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of study products through standard operating procedures, patient informed consent, contractual indemnification provisions with clients and insurance. We monitor clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines. We have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the United States and in many foreign countries and to serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of drug development services. The contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against all our own actions, such as gross negligence. We currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate. Potential Volatility of Quarterly Operating Results and Stock Price Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include: the timing and level of new business authorizations; the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects; the timing and amount of costs associated with R&D and compound partnering collaborations; the timing of our Discovery Sciences segment milestone payments or other revenue, if any; our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel; 50 Table of Contents our ability to properly manage our growth; the timing of the opening of new offices; the timing of other internal expansion costs; exchange rate fluctuations between periods; our dependence on a small number of industries and clients; the mix of products and services sold in a particular period; pricing pressure in the market for our services; rapid technological change; the timing and amount of start up costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products and services; the timing and extent of new government regulations; intellectual property risks; impairment of investments or intangible assets; and the timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions. Delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by our clients or regulatory authorities, and are not typically controllable by us. Because a large percentage of our operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation, variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect our quarterly operating results. For these reasons, we believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in quarterly results, actual or anticipated changes in our dividend policy or other factors could affect the market price of our common stock. These factors include ones beyond our control, such as changes in earnings estimates by analysts, market conditions in our industry, disclosures by product development partners and actions by regulatory authorities with respect to potential drug candidates, changes in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries and the government sponsored clinical research sector and general economic conditions. Any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance. For further details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of our international operations. We derived approximately 27.6%, 29.2% and 32.3% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, from operations outside the United States. We generally reinvest funds generated by each subsidiary in the country where they are earned, although in 2005, we repatriated $48.0 million of undistributed earnings in the form of dividends from our foreign affiliates under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our operations in the United Kingdom generated more than 28.3% of our net revenue from international operations during 2006. Accordingly, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currencies, predominately in the pound sterling. The vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. subsidiaries. The contracts entered into by the U.S. subsidiaries are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars. Contracts entered into by our U.K. subsidiaries are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling or euros, with the majority in U.S. dollars. Although an increase in exchange rates for the pound sterling or euro relative to the U.S. dollar would increase net revenue from contracts denominated in these currencies, a negative impact on income from operations results from dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the United States. In these cases, revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, but the costs associated with performing these contracts, which are paid in local currency, are negatively impacted when translated into U.S. dollars. In January 2004, we began entering into foreign currency hedging activities in an effort to manage our potential foreign exchange exposure. At December 31, 2006, no such hedging contracts were outstanding. We also have currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of clients under contracts and the collection of client payments against those invoices. If a contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys local currency, we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount. Changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared 51 Table of Contents until payment from the client will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the receivable. We recognize this difference as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss, as applicable, and report it in other income, net. If the exchange rate on accounts receivable balances denominated in pounds sterling had increased by 10%, our foreign currency transaction loss would have increased by $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. Our strategy for managing foreign currency risk relies primarily on receiving payment in the same currency used to pay expenses and from time to time using foreign currency derivatives, such as forward exchange contracts. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts. If the U.S. dollar had weakened an additional 10% relative to the pound sterling, euro and Brazilian real in 2006, net income would have been approximately $9.4 million lower for the year based on 2006 revenues and the costs related to our foreign operations. During 2006, the net impact to income from operations was $3.6 million attributable to foreign currency transactions. Changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of foreign subsidiaries financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. The process by which we translate each foreign subsidiarys financial results to U.S. dollars is as follows: we translate income statement accounts at average exchange rates for the period; we translate balance sheet assets and liability accounts at end of period exchange rates; and we translate equity accounts at historical exchange rates. Translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects shareholders equity through the cumulative translation adjustment account. This account exists only in the foreign subsidiarys U.S. dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet, stated in U.S. dollars, in balance. We report translation adjustments with accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders equity. To date, cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position. However, future translation adjustments could materially and adversely affect us. Currently, there are no material exchange controls on the payment of dividends or otherwise prohibiting the transfer of funds out of or from within any country in which we conduct operations. Although we perform services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions, we have not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries. However, new or modified exchange control restrictions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. We are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and amounts outstanding under notes payable and lines of credit. We invest our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions. We do not expect that a 10% change in interest rates in the future would have a material effect on our financial statements.
