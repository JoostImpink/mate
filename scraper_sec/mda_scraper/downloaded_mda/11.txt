Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General The Companys principal source of revenue is derived from providing processing and support services to securities brokerage affiliates of banks, other financial institutions and broker dealers. Net revenues principally include processing and support fees, margin interest, commissions and other miscellaneous fees which are ancillary to customer securities transactions, less interest expense. The major non interest expenses incurred by the Company relate to employees compensation and benefits and other direct costs of processing and support services, such as floor brokerage and clearing charges, occupancy and equipment costs and other operating expenses. Although the Companys business cannot be characterized as seasonal, retail brokerage activity is typically, but not always, slower in the summer months of June, July and August. Reduced transaction volume generally results in reduced levels of processing and support service fees and commission revenues. Variations in transaction volume may cause the Companys operating results to fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis. During 1996 and 1995, business conditions related to the provision of processing and support services to the securities brokerage affiliates of banks and other financial institutions were favorably impacted by stable short term interest rates which helped increase the activity in both the equity and mutual fund markets. The financial services industry is currently undergoing increased consolidation. If any of the banks or other financial institutions processing brokerage transactions through BHC Securities, Inc. ("BHC") were to consolidate, such consolidation might result in an increase, decrease or no change in the use of BHCs processing and support services depending on whether and the extent to which the surviving consolidated entity continues its relationship with BHC. From time to time, BHCs Clients may also review the possibility of internalizing their securities brokerage processing functions. BHC attempts to mitigate the risk of loss by entering into longer term contracts with larger Clients, providing superior products and services at "cost effective" prices and developing software and systems for Clients that meet their specific needs. BHC markets to prospective Clients on a continuing basis and added ten new Clients in 1996. BHC lost three clients in 1996. While BHC recently expanded its marketing plan to target broker dealers and investment advisors not affiliated with financial institutions, it continues to market to large financial institutions and a significant portion of its revenues are dependent on approximately fifteen large financial institutions. (See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) As previously disclosed in prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, three Clients of BHC have notified BHC of their intentions to internalize their securities processing brokerage function. These Clients 15 accounted for 31% of BHCs 1996 total revenues. It is anticipated that NISI will terminate its clearing agreement with BHC in the third quarter of 1997, USAA in the fourth quarter of 1997 and CIS at the end of the second quarter of 1998. While these events will have an adverse financial impact on the Company, the amount can not be quantified in advance due to the variable nature of the securities processing business. BHC will continue to intensify its effort to broaden its client base and markets and to diversify its security processing business. It is anticipated that over time, the loss of these clients will be replaced by new clients and the growth of existing clients. See Item 1. The Company Dependence on Key Clients. Subsequent Event Merger of the Company On March 2, 1997, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Fiserv, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Fiserv Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Fiserv Sub will be merged into the Company, and the Company will be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv. At the Effective Time, the Company will change its name to "Fiserv Clearing, Inc." It is presently contemplated that the Effective Time will be May 30, 1997 or shortly thereafter. Fiserv, headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, is an independent provider of financial data processing systems and related information management services and products to more than 5,000 banks, credit unions, mortgage firms and savings institutions worldwide. The common stock of Fiserv is traded on The Nasdaq National Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock MarketSM under the symbol "FISV." Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of the Companys Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive such number of shares of Fiserv Common Stock as shall equal the Conversion Ratio, which is defined as the quotient of (x) $33.50 divided by (y) an amount equal to the average closing price of Fiserv Common Stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the 20 trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the Effective Time. The Merger has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both the Company and Fiserv and is subject to approval by the Companys stockholders as well as receipt of all required regulatory and other approvals. The obligations of Fiserv and the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent waivable) of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. In the event that Fiserv reasonably determines that the Merger would be accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, then, subject to the others terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger will be consummated. In the event that Fiserv reasonably determines that the Merger cannot be accounted for as a pooling of interests, then, subject to the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the merger will be consummated and will be accounted for as a purchase, providing that the merger consideration will be adjusted by modifying the definition of Conversion Ratio such that $33.50 is replaced with $31.50. 16 It is anticipated that the Merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16. Because of the recent purchases by the Company of its Common Stock, the Company may be required, among other things, to sell approximately 200,000 shares of its Common Stock (either through the exercise of stock options or by a stock offering to unrelated parties) prior to the Effective Time in order for the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. As part of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue and sell such shares after the date of the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement, and prior to the consummation of the Merger, to the extent necessary to satisfy such condition. Important Factors Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements regarding the Companys expectations as to its future operations and financial condition and certain other information presented in this Annual Report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations. Factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include a general downturn in the economy or the stock markets and the related transaction activity, substantial changes in interest rates, the gain or loss of significant customers, unforeseen new competition, changes in government policy or regulation and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings. Results of Operations The Companys revenues are directly affected by the income derived from its processing and support services. Such revenues are affected by both the transaction volume of accounts and the level of, and interest rate charged on, customer margin debit balances. The information in the table below should be considered when reading the discussion and analysis of operating results that follow the table. Percentage Change For the Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 Year Ended December 31, Compared Compared 1996 1995 1994 to 1995 to 1994 Total transactions (in thousands) 2,239 1,665 1,383 34% 20% Daily average transactions processed 8,813 6,606 5,487 33% 20% Number of active accounts at end of period (in thousands)(1) 1,125 1,075 916 5% 17% Average margin debit balances (in millions) $ 379 $ 322 $ 316 18% 2% Average broker call rate 7.03% 7.58% 5.94% (1) Active accounts are generally those that have positions or have had brokerage processing activity during the previous 18 months. 17 1996 Compared with 1995 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 reached $81.2 million which was $15.5 million, or 24%, greater than the $65.7 million generated for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increases were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, net interest income, commissions and other income. Processing and support service fees increased to $50.6 million for 1996 from $42.5 million in 1995, a 19% increase. The increase was due to increased transaction volume of 34% for the period. The financial results of 1996 reflect the loss of three Clients during the year which was offset by transactions from new clients signed late in 1995 and throughout 1996. The average revenue per ticket declined by $2.94, or 12%, in 1996 when compared to 1995. Generally in periods where daily transaction volumes are increasing, revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when various volume levels are achieved. In addition, the Company faces pressure on profit margins as Clients become larger due to the threat of Clients internalizing their brokerage processing and support functions and due to general pricing pressure from increased market competition. Net interest income (margin interest income and other interest income less interest expense) increased to $16.6 million in 1996 from $13.7 million in 1995, a 21% increase. The increase was due to increases in margin and other interest bearing assets. For 1996 margin interest increased to $28.3 million from $25.6 million in 1995, an 11% increase. Average margin balances outstanding increased $57 million, or 18%, for 1996 when compared to the same 1995 period. Offsetting these increases were decreases in the average broker call rate of 55 basis points for 1996 when compared to the 1995 period. Other interest income increased to $4.9 million in 1996 from $3.8 million in 1995, a 31% increase, due to an increase in securities borrowed and other interest bearing assets. A decrease in the average Federal Funds rate of approximately 50 basis points for 1996 when compared to the same periods last year, led to a decrease in the Companys rate for borrowing. The decline in rates was offset by the increased funding needed for the growth in interest bearing assets, resulting in a slight increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail sales from TradeStar increased to $9.2 million in 1996 from $6.6 million in 1995, an increase of 40%. This was the result of transaction volume which was up 37% in 1996 when compared to 1995. Customer accounts purchased in the third quarter of 1995 represented 70% of the increase and the remainder of the increase was due to growth in retail activity. In 1996, other income increased to $4.8 million from $2.9 million in 1995, a 64% increase. The increases were primarily due to increased quote service fees from netVest and Banquote and income from investments. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 18% in 1996 compared to the same period in 1995. The increases were primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, 18 communication costs, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Employees compensation and benefits increased to $23.4 million in 1996 from $20.4 million in 1995, a 15% increase. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the staff additions related to the acquisition by the Company of netVest and the acquisition by TradeStar of PNC Securities Corps Trade$aver, a discount broker service for correspondent banks and individuals in the third quarter of 1995, and normal and recurring salary adjustments. Average full time equivalents increased by 8% in 1996 when compared to 1995, and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 4% from 1996 to 1995. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing expense of $337,000, or 6%, was a direct result of the increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 12% and 14%, respectively, of processing and support fees for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Occupancy and equipment costs increased to $6.8 million in 1996 from $6.0 million in 1995, a 14% increase. This was due in part to increased variable costs related to the increase in mutual fund processing and increased rent as a result of the business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. Communications expenses increased to $3.8 million in 1996 from $2.8 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The increase was due in part to the costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest, which was acquired early in the third quarter of 1995, and increased costs associated with the Banquote product. Other operating expenses increased to $11.2 million in 1996 from $8.4 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The primary reason for the increases are related to systems development initiatives for order entry products that will continue to be funded through the first quarter of 1997, as well as to travel and promotion costs and amortization of goodwill on the 1995 acquisitions. The provision for income taxes increased to $11.9 million and the effective tax rate was 40% in 1996 compared to a 38% effective tax rate in 1995. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a reduction in the percentage of income derived from state tax exempt income. On January 21, 1994, BHC received notice that a purported holder of a brokerage account with a BHC Client filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York which alleges that BHC received, in violation of New York statutory and common law, cash payments from market makers in certain securities (referred to as payment for order flow) in return for BHC executing customer orders with such market makers. In the complaint, the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and damages, a return of cash payments for order flow, in addition to clearing and execution fees earned by BHC from January 1, 1990, certification of this matter as a class action, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees in an unspecified amount. Payment for order flow is common practice within the securities industry. BHC removed this matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the federal court, on December 18, 1995, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and on 19 January 17, 1997 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the final judgment of the Lower Court on jurisdictional grounds and remanded with instructions to remand the action to State Court. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this matter will have no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. The materiality of this matter on the Companys future operating results depends on the level of future results of operations, as well as on the timing and amount of the ultimate outcome. 1995 Compared with 1994 In 1995, net revenues increased $10.3 million, or 19%, over 1994. The higher net revenues were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, commissions, net interest and other income. Processing and support service fees increased $5.3 million, or 14%, due to a 20% increase in transactions processed. In periods when transaction volumes increase, processing and support service revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when certain volume levels are achieved. As a result of an increase in transactions processed in 1995, average processing and support service revenues per ticket decreased $1.35, or 5%. Net interest income of $13.8 million in 1995 increased $2.5 million, or 22%, from the 1994 level of $11.3 million. The growth was principally attributable to an increase in margin interest income of $5.3 million, or 27%, which was a result of a $6 million, or 2%, growth in average margin debit balances. This increase was despite the loss of a single margin account of $30 million in the second quarter of 1995 as a result of managements determination that the account was unduly concentrated. The positive effect of the increased average margin balances was further enhanced by the higher interest rate environment experienced in 1995. The year to year increase in the average broker call rate was 164 basis points. Interest expense in 1995 increased $3.7 million, or 31%. Increased funding needed for the growth in average margin debit balances and an increase in the federal funds rate of approximately 170 basis points resulted in the increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail trades from customers of TradeStar increased $2.0 million, or 43%, in 1995. This was a result of a 57% increase in transactions processed. Customer accounts purchased late in the third quarter of 1995 represented 8% of the increase. In 1995, other income increased $519,000, or 21%. PC and telephone inquiry, trading, and quote services from netVest and other fees ancillary to the processing of securities transactions accounted for the increase. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 12% in 1995 primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, floor brokerage and clearing and communications costs. 20 Employees compensation and benefits increased $3 million, or 17%, in 1995. Compensation expenses in 1995 include the impact of approximately $450,000, or 3%, related to business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. An increase of $550,000, or 3%, in officers incentive bonuses, which are tied to the companys earnings, was also included in 1995. After adjusting for the number of employees related to business units acquired, average full time employees increased 7% while normal and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 6%. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing of $1 million, or 22%, was a direct result of the 20% increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 14% and 13%, respectively, of processing and support service fees for 1995 and 1994, respectively. Communications, occupancy and equipment costs increased $783,000, or 10%, in 1995. The increase in cost was due to the addition of redundant data and voice communication lines, increased quote costs related to the Banquote product and costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest. Other operating expenses decreased by $192,000, or 2%, in 1995. The primary reason for the decrease was lower local taxes and product maintenance costs, offset by higher state franchise taxes, promotional expenses and consulting programming fees in connection with enhancements to the brokerage processing system. The provision for income taxes increased $2.3 million in 1995 due primarily to higher pre tax income as compared to 1994. The effective tax rate was 37.7% in 1995 and 36.6% in 1994. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a smaller portion of income derived from state tax exempt income in 1995. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 1996, 96% of assets consisted of cash, assets readily convertible into cash or assets collateralized by marketable securities. Stockholders equity was $93.5 million at December 31, 1996, up $8.2 million, or 10%, from December 31, 1995, which was due to earnings offset by dividends and the repurchase of $9.0 million of the Companys Common Stock. The Company has uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $215 million with several banks. At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding borrowings under these arrangements of $33.2 million. These demand loans, which are used to finance receivables in customers margin accounts, bear interest at the respective banks overnight borrowing rate and are collateralized by securities held in customers margin accounts and cash equivalents. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing credit arrangements are adequate to meet the Companys short term operating capital needs. On January 15, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.03 per share dividend payable February 14, 1997 to stockholders of record on February 1, 1997, resulting in a payment of approximately $190,000. 21 BHC, TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission. BHC is subject to the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., and TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., relating to liquidity, minimum net capital levels and the use of customer funds and securities. BHC, BHCM and, since the Company acquired it, TradeStar have always operated in excess of the applicable minimum net capital requirements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing capital and lines of credit are sufficient to meet the operating capital needs for the foreseeable future in light of known and reasonably estimated trends. Other The Company licenses its software under a long term licensing agreement. The software provider is responsible for maintenance of the system including modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after the year 2000. The software provider has issued a formal plan for compliance with year 2000 system enhancements and it is not anticipated that this will result in a material financial undertaking by the Company to complete. Effects of Inflation Because the Companys assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, such as employees compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs and communications expense, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates, this may adversely affect transaction volume, which, in turn, may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 22

Because of the recent purchases by the Company of its Common Stock, the Company may be required, among other things, to sell approximately 200,000 shares of its Common Stock (either through the exercise of stock options or by a stock offering to unrelated parties) prior to the Effective Time in order for the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. As part of the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue and sell such shares after the date of the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement, and prior to the consummation of the Merger, to the extent necessary to satisfy such condition. Important Factors Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements regarding the Companys expectations as to its future operations and financial condition and certain other information presented in this Annual Report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations. Factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include a general downturn in the economy or the stock markets and the related transaction activity, substantial changes in interest rates, the gain or loss of significant customers, unforeseen new competition, changes in government policy or regulation and unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings. Results of Operations The Companys revenues are directly affected by the income derived from its processing and support services. Such revenues are affected by both the transaction volume of accounts and the level of, and interest rate charged on, customer margin debit balances. The information in the table below should be considered when reading the discussion and analysis of operating results that follow the table. Percentage Change For the Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 Year Ended December 31, Compared Compared 1996 1995 1994 to 1995 to 1994 Total transactions (in thousands) 2,239 1,665 1,383 34% 20% Daily average transactions processed 8,813 6,606 5,487 33% 20% Number of active accounts at end of period (in thousands)(1) 1,125 1,075 916 5% 17% Average margin debit balances (in millions) $ 379 $ 322 $ 316 18% 2% Average broker call rate 7.03% 7.58% 5.94% (1) Active accounts are generally those that have positions or have had brokerage processing activity during the previous 18 months. 17 1996 Compared with 1995 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1996 reached $81.2 million which was $15.5 million, or 24%, greater than the $65.7 million generated for the year ended December 31, 1995. The increases were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, net interest income, commissions and other income. Processing and support service fees increased to $50.6 million for 1996 from $42.5 million in 1995, a 19% increase. The increase was due to increased transaction volume of 34% for the period. The financial results of 1996 reflect the loss of three Clients during the year which was offset by transactions from new clients signed late in 1995 and throughout 1996. The average revenue per ticket declined by $2.94, or 12%, in 1996 when compared to 1995. Generally in periods where daily transaction volumes are increasing, revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when various volume levels are achieved. In addition, the Company faces pressure on profit margins as Clients become larger due to the threat of Clients internalizing their brokerage processing and support functions and due to general pricing pressure from increased market competition. Net interest income (margin interest income and other interest income less interest expense) increased to $16.6 million in 1996 from $13.7 million in 1995, a 21% increase. The increase was due to increases in margin and other interest bearing assets. For 1996 margin interest increased to $28.3 million from $25.6 million in 1995, an 11% increase. Average margin balances outstanding increased $57 million, or 18%, for 1996 when compared to the same 1995 period. Offsetting these increases were decreases in the average broker call rate of 55 basis points for 1996 when compared to the 1995 period. Other interest income increased to $4.9 million in 1996 from $3.8 million in 1995, a 31% increase, due to an increase in securities borrowed and other interest bearing assets. A decrease in the average Federal Funds rate of approximately 50 basis points for 1996 when compared to the same periods last year, led to a decrease in the Companys rate for borrowing. The decline in rates was offset by the increased funding needed for the growth in interest bearing assets, resulting in a slight increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail sales from TradeStar increased to $9.2 million in 1996 from $6.6 million in 1995, an increase of 40%. This was the result of transaction volume which was up 37% in 1996 when compared to 1995. Customer accounts purchased in the third quarter of 1995 represented 70% of the increase and the remainder of the increase was due to growth in retail activity. In 1996, other income increased to $4.8 million from $2.9 million in 1995, a 64% increase. The increases were primarily due to increased quote service fees from netVest and Banquote and income from investments. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 18% in 1996 compared to the same period in 1995. The increases were primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, 18 communication costs, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. Employees compensation and benefits increased to $23.4 million in 1996 from $20.4 million in 1995, a 15% increase. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the staff additions related to the acquisition by the Company of netVest and the acquisition by TradeStar of PNC Securities Corps Trade$aver, a discount broker service for correspondent banks and individuals in the third quarter of 1995, and normal and recurring salary adjustments. Average full time equivalents increased by 8% in 1996 when compared to 1995, and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 4% from 1996 to 1995. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing expense of $337,000, or 6%, was a direct result of the increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 12% and 14%, respectively, of processing and support fees for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Occupancy and equipment costs increased to $6.8 million in 1996 from $6.0 million in 1995, a 14% increase. This was due in part to increased variable costs related to the increase in mutual fund processing and increased rent as a result of the business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. Communications expenses increased to $3.8 million in 1996 from $2.8 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The increase was due in part to the costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest, which was acquired early in the third quarter of 1995, and increased costs associated with the Banquote product. Other operating expenses increased to $11.2 million in 1996 from $8.4 million in 1995, a 33% increase. The primary reason for the increases are related to systems development initiatives for order entry products that will continue to be funded through the first quarter of 1997, as well as to travel and promotion costs and amortization of goodwill on the 1995 acquisitions. The provision for income taxes increased to $11.9 million and the effective tax rate was 40% in 1996 compared to a 38% effective tax rate in 1995. The increase in the effective tax rate was due to a reduction in the percentage of income derived from state tax exempt income. On January 21, 1994, BHC received notice that a purported holder of a brokerage account with a BHC Client filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York which alleges that BHC received, in violation of New York statutory and common law, cash payments from market makers in certain securities (referred to as payment for order flow) in return for BHC executing customer orders with such market makers. In the complaint, the plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and damages, a return of cash payments for order flow, in addition to clearing and execution fees earned by BHC from January 1, 1990, certification of this matter as a class action, punitive damages, costs and attorneys fees in an unspecified amount. Payment for order flow is common practice within the securities industry. BHC removed this matter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the federal court, on December 18, 1995, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal, and on 19 January 17, 1997 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the final judgment of the Lower Court on jurisdictional grounds and remanded with instructions to remand the action to State Court. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this matter will have no material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. The materiality of this matter on the Companys future operating results depends on the level of future results of operations, as well as on the timing and amount of the ultimate outcome. 1995 Compared with 1994 In 1995, net revenues increased $10.3 million, or 19%, over 1994. The higher net revenues were the result of increases in processing and support service fees, commissions, net interest and other income. Processing and support service fees increased $5.3 million, or 14%, due to a 20% increase in transactions processed. In periods when transaction volumes increase, processing and support service revenue will increase, while processing and support service revenue per ticket will decline. This is due to BHCs volume discount program which rewards Clients for high transaction volumes by reducing the charge per transaction when certain volume levels are achieved. As a result of an increase in transactions processed in 1995, average processing and support service revenues per ticket decreased $1.35, or 5%. Net interest income of $13.8 million in 1995 increased $2.5 million, or 22%, from the 1994 level of $11.3 million. The growth was principally attributable to an increase in margin interest income of $5.3 million, or 27%, which was a result of a $6 million, or 2%, growth in average margin debit balances. This increase was despite the loss of a single margin account of $30 million in the second quarter of 1995 as a result of managements determination that the account was unduly concentrated. The positive effect of the increased average margin balances was further enhanced by the higher interest rate environment experienced in 1995. The year to year increase in the average broker call rate was 164 basis points. Interest expense in 1995 increased $3.7 million, or 31%. Increased funding needed for the growth in average margin debit balances and an increase in the federal funds rate of approximately 170 basis points resulted in the increase in interest expense. Commissions on retail trades from customers of TradeStar increased $2.0 million, or 43%, in 1995. This was a result of a 57% increase in transactions processed. Customer accounts purchased late in the third quarter of 1995 represented 8% of the increase. In 1995, other income increased $519,000, or 21%. PC and telephone inquiry, trading, and quote services from netVest and other fees ancillary to the processing of securities transactions accounted for the increase. Expenses, excluding interest, increased by 12% in 1995 primarily related to increases in employees compensation and benefits, floor brokerage and clearing and communications costs. 20 Employees compensation and benefits increased $3 million, or 17%, in 1995. Compensation expenses in 1995 include the impact of approximately $450,000, or 3%, related to business units acquired in the third quarter of 1995. An increase of $550,000, or 3%, in officers incentive bonuses, which are tied to the companys earnings, was also included in 1995. After adjusting for the number of employees related to business units acquired, average full time employees increased 7% while normal and recurring salary adjustments increased an average of 6%. The increase in floor brokerage and clearing of $1 million, or 22%, was a direct result of the 20% increase in transactions processed. Floor brokerage and clearing represents 14% and 13%, respectively, of processing and support service fees for 1995 and 1994, respectively. Communications, occupancy and equipment costs increased $783,000, or 10%, in 1995. The increase in cost was due to the addition of redundant data and voice communication lines, increased quote costs related to the Banquote product and costs associated with the PC and telephone inquiry, trading and quote services offered through netVest. Other operating expenses decreased by $192,000, or 2%, in 1995. The primary reason for the decrease was lower local taxes and product maintenance costs, offset by higher state franchise taxes, promotional expenses and consulting programming fees in connection with enhancements to the brokerage processing system. The provision for income taxes increased $2.3 million in 1995 due primarily to higher pre tax income as compared to 1994. The effective tax rate was 37.7% in 1995 and 36.6% in 1994. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a smaller portion of income derived from state tax exempt income in 1995. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 1996, 96% of assets consisted of cash, assets readily convertible into cash or assets collateralized by marketable securities. Stockholders equity was $93.5 million at December 31, 1996, up $8.2 million, or 10%, from December 31, 1995, which was due to earnings offset by dividends and the repurchase of $9.0 million of the Companys Common Stock. The Company has uncommitted credit arrangements totaling $215 million with several banks. At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding borrowings under these arrangements of $33.2 million. These demand loans, which are used to finance receivables in customers margin accounts, bear interest at the respective banks overnight borrowing rate and are collateralized by securities held in customers margin accounts and cash equivalents. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing credit arrangements are adequate to meet the Companys short term operating capital needs. On January 15, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.03 per share dividend payable February 14, 1997 to stockholders of record on February 1, 1997, resulting in a payment of approximately $190,000. 21 BHC, TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission. BHC is subject to the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., and TradeStar and BHCM are subject to the requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., relating to liquidity, minimum net capital levels and the use of customer funds and securities. BHC, BHCM and, since the Company acquired it, TradeStar have always operated in excess of the applicable minimum net capital requirements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the Companys existing capital and lines of credit are sufficient to meet the operating capital needs for the foreseeable future in light of known and reasonably estimated trends. Other The Company licenses its software under a long term licensing agreement. The software provider is responsible for maintenance of the system including modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after the year 2000. The software provider has issued a formal plan for compliance with year 2000 system enhancements and it is not anticipated that this will result in a material financial undertaking by the Company to complete. Effects of Inflation Because the Companys assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, inflation may result in increases in the Companys expenses, such as employees compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs and communications expense, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates, this may adversely affect transaction volume, which, in turn, may adversely affect the Companys results of operations. 22

Unless otherwise required by law, the Company disclaims an obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. Overview The Company assists in the design and manufacture of sophisticated electronic and electromechanical systems and devices, and complex interconnect systems on a contract basis for its customers. Engineering and manufacturing facilities are located in Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The Companys customers conduct business in a variety of markets with significant revenues from customers in the defense, natural resources, industrial, medical, commercial aerospace and computing and communications markets. As a contract manufacturer, revenues are impacted primarily by the volume of shipments in the particular period. The Company provides information about its end markets to demonstrate the diversity of its customer base, which the Company believes helps to reduce potential volatility in its revenue stream. However, the Company does not target customers in individual markets, but rather targets companies whose manufacturing requirements match the services and capabilities the Company provides. Within all end markets, gross profit margins vary widely by customer and by contract. The most significant factors influencing profitability in a particular period are: the mix of contracts with deliveries in that period and the volume of sales in relation to the Companys fixed costs during that period. Delivery schedules are generally determined by the Companys customers. The significant factors that influence the profitability of the individual contracts include: (i) the competitive environment in which the contract was bid; (ii) the experience level of the Company in manufacturing these particular product(s); (iii) the stability of the design of the product(s); and (iv) the accuracy of the Companys original cost estimates as reflected in the sale price for the product(s). The Company has a centralized sales organization. Though the selling and marketing personnel have a customer and prospective customer focus, they are not limited to exclusively developing a specific end market. On November 25, 2008, Eclipse Aviation Corporation (Eclipse), a customer of the Company, announced that it filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On March 5, 2009, the Eclipse bankruptcy was converted to Chapter 7 liquidation. The Eclipse bankruptcy negatively impacted the Companys financial results for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009, as described in more detail throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report. The end market for sales to Eclipse was commercial aerospace. The Company acquired Pensar Electronic Solutions, LLC (Pensar) on December 22, 2008. Therefore, the Companys financial results for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, includes 52 weeks of Pensar activity, compared with 27 weeks of activity for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009. The impact of the Pensar acquisition is described in the Results of Operations section that follows. Results of Operations &ndash; Fiscal 2010 &ndash; 2009 &ndash; 2008 Backlog (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Defense $ (3,049 ) $ 110,430 $ 113,479 $ 119,407 Natural resources 21,888 36,357 14,469 18,058 Industrial 16,301 28,631 12,330 20,780 Medical (2,387 ) 18,165 20,552 11,495 Commercial aerospace (1,643 ) 1,612 3,255 46,230 Government systems 18 19 1 3,743 Other (409 ) 3,513 3,922 1,580 Total backlog $30,719 $ 198,727 $ 168,008 $ 221,293 The backlog at June 27, 2010 increased $30.7 million from June 28, 2009. The $21.9 million increase in natural resources backlog is primarily attributable to strong bookings with wind power generation and oil and gas customers. The $16.3 million increase in industrial backlog is primarily comprised of stronger bookings of electronic assemblies used in high performance semiconductor test equipment and systems ($5.1 million) and additional bookings of electronic and electromechanical assemblies used in capital equipment for glass container fabrication systems ($8.2 million). The backlog at June 28, 2009 included $20.4 million from the Pensar acquisition. Absent the Pensar acquisition, the backlog from June 29, 2008 to June 28, 2009 decreased by $73.7 million. The $43.0 million reduction in commercial aerospace is primarily related to the Eclipse bankruptcy described in more detail in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining decline in backlog results from reduced orders in several market sectors due to the economic downturn. The $9.1 million increase in medical backlog primarily resulted from the Pensar acquisition. Approximately $30.4 million of the backlog at fiscal 2010 year end is scheduled to ship beyond the next 12 months, pursuant to the shipment schedules of the contracts that comprise backlog. This compares with $22.9 million at fiscal year end 2009. Net Sales (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Defense $ (5,701 ) $ 121,528 $ 127,229 $ 107,882 Industrial 13,335 65,416 52,081 50,873 Natural resources 7,271 57,521 50,250 65,375 Medical 6,537 31,299 24,762 19,979 Commercial aerospace (4,083 ) 4,157 8,240 20,386 Government systems (4,090 ) 13 4,103 10,565 Other 2,666 9,369 6,703 4,425 Total net sales $15,935 $ 289,303 $ 273,368 $ 279,485 The Pensar acquisition, which occurred in fiscal year 2009 and is described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contributed $62.4 million of net sales in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with $25.9 million in the six months ended June 28, 2009. The overall increase in Pensars sales in fiscal year 2010 versus fiscal year 2009 is primarily due to the fact that Pensar was included in the Companys results for approximately half of the 2009 fiscal year and for the entire 2010 fiscal year. The $36.5 million increase in sales for this facility during fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 included an increase of $16.5 million in the natural resources market, a $10.5 million increase in the industrial market, and a $7.1 million increase in the medical market. For the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, excluding the impact of the Pensar acquisition, sales decreased $20.6 million, versus the comparable period a year earlier. The overall economic downturn was the primary contributor to the sales decline. Excluding the impact of the Pensar acquisition, fiscal 2010 sales to defense customers decreased $5.7 million; sales to natural resources customers decreased $9.3 million; sales to industrial customers increased $2.8 million; sales to commercial aerospace customers decreased $4.1 million; and sales to other customers decreased $4.3 million, versus fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of the Pensar acquisition, the $5.7 million decrease in defense sales in fiscal year 2010 related to reduced shipments under several contracts to produce cable and electronic assemblies for a variety of defense applications, including military aircraft, missile systems, radar systems and shipboard programs. Sales to customers in the natural resources market were negatively impacted by the overall economic downturn. This downturn resulted in a $9.3 million decrease in natural resources sales primarily in the oil and gas sector. Government systems sales were down as the Company completed a large multi year contract for baggage scanning equipment in December 2008. Commercial aerospace sales decreased due to the bankruptcy of Eclipse described in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Pensar acquisition contributed $25.9 million of net sales to the 2009 fiscal year. The overall decrease in net sales between fiscal years 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to the economic downturn. The $19.3 million increase in defense sales in fiscal year 2009 related to several contracts to produce cable and electronic assemblies for a variety of defense applications, including military aircraft, missile systems, radar systems and shipboard programs. Sales to customers in the natural resources market were negatively impacted by the overall economic downturn. This downturn was partially offset by $9.7 million of natural resources sales from the Pensar acquisition, in the wind power generation sector. The increase in medical sales was driven by $8.7 million of sales from the Pensar acquisition. Government systems sales were down as the Company completed a large multi year contract for baggage scanning equipment in December 2008. Commercial aerospace sales decreased due to the bankruptcy of Eclipse described in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales to the Companys 10 largest customers represented 60.3% of total revenue in fiscal 2010, versus 64.4% in fiscal 2009 and 69.6% in fiscal 2008. The Companys top three customers and their relative contribution to fiscal year 2010 sales were Owens Illinois, Inc, 14.0%; American Superconductor, 8.8%; and Raytheon Company, 8.2%. The Companys top three customers for fiscal year 2009 were Owens Illinois, Inc., 14.2%; Raytheon Company, 8.8%; and Schlumberger Ltd., 8.5%. The Companys top three customers for fiscal year 2008 were Owens Illinois, Inc., 14.2%; Schlumberger Ltd., 11.2% and Modular Mining Systems, Inc., 9.4%. Cost of Sales and Gross Profit (dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Cost of sales $9,094 $ 231,677 $ 222,583 $ 224,498 Percent of net sales (130 ) basis pts. 80.1 % 81.4 % 80.3 % Gross profit $6,841 57,626 50,785 54,987 Gross profit margin 130 basis pts. 19.9 % 18.6 % 19.7 % Gross profit margins vary significantly by contract. The most significant factors influencing profitability in a particular period are: the mix of contracts with deliveries in that period; and, the volume of sales in relation to the Companys fixed costs during the period. Delivery schedules are generally determined by the Companys customers. The significant factors that influence the profitability of individual contracts include: (i) the competitive environment in which the contract was bid; (ii) the experience level of the Company in manufacturing the particular product(s); (iii) the stability of the design of the product(s); and (iv) the accuracy of the Companys original cost estimates. Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, increased $9.1 million, compared with the prior fiscal year, driven by the fiscal year 2010 sales increase of $15.9 million. Gross profit for fiscal year 2010 increased $6.8 million and gross profit margin was up 130 basis points versus the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross profit margin from 18.6% in fiscal year 2009 to 19.9% in fiscal year 2010 was primarily driven by the impact of the write down of inventory related to the Eclipse program, described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fiscal 2009 write down of Eclipse related inventory increased cost of sales and reduced gross profit by $4.2 million. This write down reduced the reported gross profit margin by 150 basis points. In addition, gross profit for fiscal year 2010 was positively impacted by $596,000, for the payment of a claim on a contract completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. This represents the final settlement of this claim. The acquisition of Pensar added cost of sales of $54.8 million and gross profit of $7.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010. The Pensar acquisition generated gross profit margin of 12.3% in the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010. Excluding the Pensar acquisition, the gross profit margin would have been 22.0% for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010. Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 decreased $1.9 million, compared with the prior fiscal year, driven by the fiscal year 2009 sales decline of $6.1 million. Gross profit for fiscal year 2009 was down $4.2 million and gross profit margin was down 110 basis points versus the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit margin from 19.7% in fiscal year 2008 to 18.6% in fiscal year 2009 was primarily driven by the write down of inventory related to the Eclipse program described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the acquisition of Pensar. In addition, gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a percentage drop in sales that exceeded the percentage drop in indirect manufacturing expenses. The acquisition of Pensar added cost of sales of $23.6 million and gross profit of $2.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009. The Pensar operation generated gross profit margin of 8.8% in the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009. The Pensar gross profit margin was negatively impacted by the step up of work in process and finished goods inventory as part of the allocation of the acquisition purchase price, which added $218,000 to cost of sales recorded by the Pensar operation. Excluding the Pensar operation, the gross profit margin would have been 19.6% for the 12 months ended June 28, 2009, a decrease of 10 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2008. Absent the Eclipse write off and the impact of the Pensar acquisition, the gross profit margin would have been 21.3% for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009, which is 160 basis points higher than the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008. During the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008, the Companys gross margin was negatively impacted by higher than anticipated labor and material costs on certain early stage long term contracts that were not fully recoverable from the Companys customers, and start up expenses on a significant new contract for the assembly of heavy mechanical products in the industrial market. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008, the Company recorded costs of $248,000, to account for the actual and anticipated loss on current and future shipments on one particular defense program for which the Company experienced significant design changes. Selling and Administrative Expense (dollars in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Selling and administrative expense $1,125 $ 33,935 $ 32,810 $ 29,557 Percent of net sales 30 basis pts. 11.7 % 12.0 % 10.6 % Selling and administrative expense increased by $1.1 million for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with the 12 months ended June 28, 2009. The selling and administrative expenses for the Pensar acquisition were $3.8 million in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with $2.1 million in the six months ended June 28, 2009. Excluding the impact of the Pensar acquisition, selling and administrative expense decreased $522,000 for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with the 12 months ended June 28, 2009. The decrease in expenses is primarily attributable to the $3.7 million write off of the Eclipse accounts receivable expensed during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, fringe benefit expense decreased $342,000, professional service fees decreased $287,000, employee relocation expenses decreased $130,000, and amortization expense decreased $246,000, compared with the year ago period. These decreases were offset by increases in incentive compensation of $3.2 million, higher salaries and wages of $638,000, and tax expense of $346,000. In fiscal year 2009, the major factors increasing selling and administrative expense, compared with fiscal 2008, were: the write off of the Eclipse accounts receivable of $3.7 million, the acquisition of Pensar of $2.1 million, and higher salaries and wages due to head count and wage inflation of $1.4 million. Partially offsetting these increases were lower incentive compensation expense of $3.1 million, lower commissions of $575,000, and reduced personnel recruiting and relocation expenses of $259,000. Interest Expense (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $417 $ 1,711 $ 1,294 $ 1,459 Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2010 from the prior year due to the full year impact of carrying the debt associated with the Pensar acquisition. The debt level decreased in the fiscal year period ended June 27, 2010, as a result of principal payments. Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2009 from the prior year due to lower average interest rates. Income Tax Expense (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended Change Fiscal June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 vs. 2009 2010 2009 2008 Income tax expense $ 818 $ 7,147 $ 6,329 $ 9,011 The effective income tax rate, prior to discrete items, for fiscal 2010 was 37%, compared with 40% and 38% in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a $795,000 reduction to income tax expense from a correction in the apportionment factor for state income tax returns for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and an increase in other tax expense, included in selling and administrative expense, of $193,000 ($125,000 after tax) for a gross receipts tax that relates to fiscal years 2005 through 2009. The Company determined that the amounts related to prior fiscal years were not material to all prior fiscal years and, therefore, recognized the adjustments during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The net impact of both adjustments to net earnings was an increase of $670,000 for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, which had a $0.04 impact on basic and diluted earnings per share. The impact on full year net earnings for fiscal year 2010 is not material. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share (amounts in thousands, except per share data) Fiscal Year Ended June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings $ 14,888 $ 10,338 $ 14,827 Basic net earnings per share $ 0.95 $ 0.67 $ 0.98 Diluted net earnings per share $ 0.93 $ 0.64 $ 0.92 Fiscal Year Ended June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 2009 2008 Average common shares outstanding basic 15,713 15,498 15,198 Dilutive options and nonvested shares 382 546 940 Adjusted average common shares outstanding diluted 16,095 16,044 16,138 All outstanding stock options and nonvested shares at June 27, 2010, June 28, 2009 and June 29, 2008, were dilutive. The stock options expire in various periods through 2014. The Company has awarded certain key executives nonvested shares tied to the Companys fiscal year 2010 financial performance. The compensation expense related to these awards is recognized quarterly. The nonvested shares vest over the next two fiscal years. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended June 27, June 28, June 29, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,997 $ 29,620 $ 18,047 Net cash (used) by investing activities (5,030 ) (56,500 ) (5,185 ) Net cash (used) provided by financing activities (10,963 ) 29,531 (11,608 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,996 ) $ 2,651 $ 1,254 The Companys operations generated $14.0 million of cash in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with $29.6 million in the 12 months ended June 28, 2009. The Pensar acquisition generated positive operating cash flows of $2.1 million for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, and $2.0 million for the six months ended June 28, 2009. Excluding the impact of Pensars operating cash flow, the primary driver of the $15.6 million reduction in operating cash flow, in the 12 months of fiscal 2010, versus the same period a year earlier, was a $35.5 million reduction in cash received from customers (excluding Pensar customers). This results from lower sales in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, exclusive of the Pensar acquisition, compared with the same fiscal period in the prior year. The lower receipts were offset by a $21.0 million reduction in disbursements for inventory purchases and other costs of production. The lower inventory purchases and other production costs were primarily driven by the reduction of sales volume for the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, exclusive of the Pensar acquisition, and a reduction of purchases of long lead materials. In addition, the cash used for payroll related expenditures decreased by $4.7 million in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, compared with the 12 months ended June 28, 2009, as a result of a reduction in the incentive compensation paid during fiscal year 2010, compared with incentive compensation paid in fiscal year 2009. The $51.5 million decrease in cash used by the Companys investing activities in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, versus the 12 months ended June 28, 2009 was driven by the $45.1 million investment in the Pensar acquisition made in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2009. Capital expenditures were $4.2 million in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010. These expenditures relate primarily to facility improvements at the Houston, Joplin and Tulsa plants. Capital expenditures were $10.8 million in the 12 months ended June 28, 2009, primarily related to the Companys $2.5 million purchase of the Tulsa manufacturing facility, which had been leased in prior years, and the $4.2 million purchase of surface mount technology equipment to expand the Companys capabilities in Pittsburgh and Tulsa. The $40.5 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities in the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, versus the 12 months ended June 28, 2009, reflects the second quarter of fiscal 2009 borrowing of $35.0 million of senior debt and $7.9 million of short term borrowings to acquire the assets of Pensar. In addition, the Company made debt payments during the 12 months ended June 27, 2010, of $8.2 million, versus debt payments of $1.7 million in fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2009, the Company paid down $10.5 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The Companys operations generated $29.6 million of cash in fiscal 2009, compared with $18.0 million in fiscal 2008. The Pensar acquisition generated positive operating cash flow of $2.0 million for fiscal year 2009. The primary driver of the increased operating cash flow was a $42.5 million reduction in disbursements for inventory purchases and other costs of production. The lower inventory purchases and other production costs were primarily driven by the reduction of sales volume in fiscal year 2009, exclusive of the Pensar acquisition, and a reduction of purchases of long lead time materials. This increase in net cash provided by operations was partially offset by a reduction of cash receipts from trade receivables of $25.0 million and a reduction of cash received from cash advances from customers of $5.2 million in fiscal year 2009, compared with fiscal year 2008. In addition, the cash used for payroll related expenditures increased by $5.6 million in fiscal year 2009, compared with fiscal year 2008. Income tax payments made during fiscal year 2009 were $4.6 million lower than in fiscal 2008. The Companys investing activities used $56.5 million in fiscal year 2009, compared with $5.2 million used in fiscal year 2008. The primary driver was the $45.1 million used to acquire Pensar (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, capital expenditures used $10.8 million, including the Companys $2.5 million purchase of the Tulsa manufacturing facility, which had been leased in prior years. Also the Company purchased $4.2 million of surface mount technology equipment to expand its capabilities in Tulsa and Pittsburgh. The $41.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2009 was primarily attributable to the $35.0 million of senior term debt used to finance the Pensar acquisition. Capital Structure The Company entered into a senior secured loan agreement on December 22, 2008, amended on January 30, 2009. The following is a summary of certain provisions of the agreement: &bull; The agreement provides for a revolving credit facility, of up to $30.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings or letters of credit. The facility is based on a borrowing base formula equal to the sum of 85% of eligible receivables and 35% of eligible inventories. As of June 27, 2010, there were no outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility. As of June 27, 2010, letters of credit issued were $1.2 million, leaving an aggregate of up to $28.8 million available under the revolving credit facility. This credit facility matures on December 22, 2011. &bull; The agreement provides for an aggregate $45.0 million term loan, with quarterly principal payments beginning in September 2009 of $2.0 million, increasing to $2.5 million in September 2010 and increasing to $2.7 million in September 2011. The balance is due on December 22, 2011. &bull; Interest on the revolving facility and the term loan is calculated at a base rate or LIBOR plus a stated spread based on certain ratios. For the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, the average rate was approximately 3.66%. &bull; All loans are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company other than real estate. &bull; The Company must comply with covenants and certain financial performance criteria consisting of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) in relation to debt, minimum net worth and operating cash flow in relation to fixed charges. The Company was in compliance with its borrowing agreement covenants as of and during the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010. To mitigate the risk associated with interest rate volatility, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on January 9, 2009. This pay fixed, receive floating rate swap limits the Companys exposure to interest rate variability and allows for better cash flow control. The swap is not used for speculative purposes. Under the original agreement, the Company fixed the interest payments to a base rate of 1.89% plus a stated spread based on certain ratios. The beginning notional amount is $35.0 million, which will amortize simultaneously with the term loan schedule in the associated loan agreement and will mature on December 22, 2011. On September 30, 2009, the Company made an additional payment in conjunction with the first principal payment under the loan agreement dated December 22, 2008. This additional payment required a restructuring of the interest rate swap agreement. As a result, the fixed base rate under the revised agreement increased to 1.92%. This rate will apply until the swap matures on December 22, 2011. The interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and the Company has formally documented, designated and assessed the effectiveness of the interest rate swap. The financial statement impact of ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, was immaterial. Fair Value: The Company considered the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, securities and other current assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The Company has considered amounts outstanding under the long term debt agreements and determined that carrying amounts recorded in the financial statements are consistent with the estimated fair value as of June 27, 2010. Additionally, the interest rate swap agreement, further described above, has been recorded by the Company based on the estimated fair value as of June 27, 2010. At June 27, 2010, the Company recorded a liability of $361,000 classified within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $222,000 (net of deferred income tax effects of $139,000) relating to the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement. The Company has classified its financial assets and liabilities using a three level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements, based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, as follows: &bull; Level 1 &ndash; inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. &bull; Level 2 &ndash; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. &bull; Level 3 &ndash; inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys interest rate swap is valued using a present value calculation based on an implied forward LIBOR curve (adjusted for the Companys credit risk) and is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, as presented below: (in thousands) Fair Value as of June 27, 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Other long term liabilities: Interest rate swap derivative $ $ 361 $ $ 361 Total $ $ 361 $ $ 361 Other Long Term Debt Other long term debt includes capital lease agreements with outstanding balances totaling $77,000 at June 27, 2010 and $238,000 at June 28, 2009. Maturities of Senior Long Term Debt and Other Long Term Obligations The aggregate maturities of long term obligations are as follows for the periods presented: (in thousands) Fiscal Year 2011 $ 12,069 2012 25,258 Total $ 37,327 Stockholders Equity and Debt The following table shows LaBarges equity and total debt positions: (in thousands) Fiscal Year Ended June 27, June 28, 2010 2009 Stockholders equity $ 115,640 $ 103,151 Total debt and capital lease obligations 37,327 45,488 The Company intends to renegotiate the senior loan agreement prior to its maturity on December 2011. Management believes the availability of funds going forward from cash generated from operations and available bank credit facilities should be sufficient to support the planned operations and capital expenditures of the Companys business for the next two fiscal years. The following table shows LaBarges contractual obligations as of June 27, 2010: (in thousands) Payment Due by Period Contractual Obligations Less than More than Total 1 year 1 &ndash; 3 years 3 &ndash; 5 years 5 years Long term debt $ 37,250 $ 12,000 $ 25,250 $ $ Capital lease obligations 77 69 8 Operating lease obligations 7,692 2,186 2,960 1,092 1,454 Total $ 45,019 $ 14,255 $ 28,218 $ 1,092 $ 1,454 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. The Company believes there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Companys senior management discusses the accounting policies described below with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors on a periodic basis. The following discussion of critical accounting policies is intended to bring to the attention of readers those accounting policies that management believes are critical to the Companys consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosures. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Companys significant accounting policies that are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010. Revenue Recognition and Cost of Sales The Companys revenue is derived from units and services delivered pursuant to contracts. The Company has a significant number of contracts for which revenue is accounted for under the percentage of completion method using the units of delivery as the measure of completion. This method is consistent with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605 35 (formerly the Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts). The percentage of total revenue recognized from contracts under the percentage of completion method is generally 30 60% of total revenue in any given quarter. These contracts are primarily fixed price contracts that vary widely in terms of size, length of performance period and expected gross profit margins. Under the units of delivery method, the Company recognizes revenue when title transfers, which is usually upon shipment of the product or completion of the service. The Company also sells products under purchase agreements, supply contracts and purchase orders that are not within the scope of ASC Topic 605 35. The Company provides goods from continuing production over a period of time. The Company builds units to the customer specifications based on firm purchase orders from the customer. The purchase orders tend to be of a relatively short duration and customers place orders on a periodic basis. The pricing is generally fixed for some length of time and the quantities are based on individual purchase orders. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized on substantially all transactions when title transfers, which is usually upon shipment. Therefore, revenue for contracts within the scope of ASC Topic 605 35 and for those not within the scope of ASC Topic 605 35 is recognized when title transfers, which is usually upon shipment or completion of the service. However, the cost of sales recognized under both contract types is determined differently. The percentage of completion method for contracts that are within the scope of ASC Topic 605 35 gives effect to the most recent contract value and estimates of cost at completion. Contract costs generally include all direct costs, such as materials, direct labor, and subcontracts and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to the contracts. Learning or start up costs, including tooling and set up costs incurred in connection with existing contracts, are charged to existing contracts. The contract costs do not include any sales, marketing or general and administrative costs. Revenue is calculated as the number of units shipped multiplied by the sales price per unit. The Company estimates the total revenue of the contract and the total contract costs and calculates the contract cost percentage and gross profit margin. The gross profit during a period is equal to the earned revenue for the period multiplied by the estimated contract gross profit margin. Thus, if no changes to estimates were made, the procedure results in every dollar of earned revenue having the same cost of earned revenue and gross profit percentage. This method is applied consistently on all of the contracts accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 605 35. The Company periodically reviews all estimates to complete as required by the authoritative guidance and the estimated total cost and expected gross profit are revised as required over the life of the contract. Any revisions to the estimated total cost are accounted for as a change of an estimate. A cumulative catch up adjustment is recorded in the period of the change of the estimated costs to complete the contract. Therefore, cost of sales and gross profit in a period includes (a) a cumulative catch up adjustment to reflect the adjustment of previously recognized profit associated with all prior period revenue recognized based on the current estimate of gross profit margin, as appropriate, and (b) an entry to record the current period costs of sales and related gross profit margin based on the current period sales multiplied by the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract. Cumulative adjustments are reported as a component of cost of sales. For contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method, managements estimates of material, labor and overhead costs on long term contracts are critical to the Company. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated material costs, historical labor performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, performance trends, asset utilization, and anticipated labor rates. The development of estimates of costs at completion involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contracts value and estimate of costs at completion are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which the change in estimate is made. When the current estimate of costs indicates a loss will be incurred on the contract, the total anticipated loss is recognized in that period. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect future financial performance. In summary, the cumulative gross profit margin recognized through the end of the current period on a contract will equal the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract multiplied by the contract revenues recognized through the end of the current period. The current period gross profit will equal current period sales multiplied by the expected gross profit margin (on a percentage basis) on the contract plus or minus any net effect of cumulative adjustments to prior period sales under the contract. In addition, when there is an anticipated loss on a contract, the entire loss is recorded in the period when the anticipated loss is determined. The loss is reported as a component of cost of sales. Therefore, the cumulative gross profit margin recognized through the end of the current period on a contract with an estimated loss will equal the current estimate of the gross profit margin on the contract multiplied by the contract revenues recognized through the end of the current period plus the provision for the additional loss on contract revenues yet to be recognized. The current period gross profit on a contract with a loss reserve will equal current period sales at a 0% gross profit margin plus or minus any net effect of cumulative adjustments to the loss reserve based on any changes to the estimated total loss on the contract. This method of recording costs for contracts under ASC Topic 605 35 is equivalent to Alternative A as described in paragraph 35 of ASC Topic 605 35. The contracts that are not subject to percentage of completion accounting are not subject to estimated costs of completion. Cost of sales under these contracts are based on the actual cost of material, labor and overhead charged to each job. The contract costs do not include any selling and administrative expenses. The Company generally performs the work under fixed price arrangements so the profit on the contract may be influenced by the accuracy of the estimates used at the time a particular job is bid, as reflected in the sales price for the product, including: material costs, inflation, labor costs (both hours and rates), complexity of the work, and asset utilization. Inventories Inventories, other than work in process inventoried costs relating to those contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting, are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Inventoried costs relating to contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting are stated at the actual production cost, including overhead, tooling and other related non recurring costs, incurred to date, reduced by the amounts identified with revenue recognized on units delivered. Selling and administrative expenses are not included in inventory costs. Inventoried costs related to these contracts are reduced, as appropriate, by charging any amounts in excess of estimated realizable value to cost of sales. The costs attributed to units delivered under these contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced. This average cost utilizes, as appropriate, the learning curve concept, which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. In accordance with industry practice, inventories include amounts relating to long term contracts that will not be realized in one year. Since the inventory balance is dependent on the estimated cost at completion of a contract, inventory is impacted by all of the factors described in the Revenue Recognition and Cost of Sales section above. Inventoried costs related to those contracts not accounted for under percentage of completion accounting are carried at the lower of cost or market. In addition, management regularly reviews all inventory for lower of cost or market value issues to determine whether any write down to the lower of cost or market value is necessary. Various factors are considered in making this determination, including expected program life, recent sales history, predicted trends and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, inventory write downs may be required. For the fiscal years ended June 27, 2010, June 28, 2009, and June 29, 2008, expense for the write down of inventory to lower of cost or market value charged to income before income taxes was $1.7 million, $1.5 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. This expense does not include the $4.2 million charge related to the Eclipse bankruptcy recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as described in the Overview section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of June of each fiscal year, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances during the fiscal year indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Potential impairment of goodwill is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss may be required to be recorded. The Company evaluates whether any triggering events have occurred during the fiscal year, such as a significant decrease in expected cash flows at a reporting unit or changes in market or other business conditions that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. In addition, the Company monitors its market capitalization, compared with the carrying value of the Company. The annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles &ndash; Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). Under guidelines established by FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting (ASC 280) the Company operates as one operating segment. However, the goodwill impairment analysis is performed at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is one level below an operating segment as defined by ASC 280. Goodwill is recorded on three of the Companys reporting units. The goodwill was a result of purchase accounting during the acquisition of these reporting units. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on a combination of a market approach and an income approach. The income approach utilizes the discounted cash flow model and the market approach is based on market data for a group of guideline companies. The Company also considers its market capitalization on the date of the impairment testing, compared with the sum of the fair values of all reporting units including those without goodwill recorded. The discounted cash flow analysis requires the Company to make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of each reporting unit. The future cash flow forecasts for each reporting unit are based on historical and forecasted revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further estimates such as expected future revenue and expense growth rates, working capital needs at each reporting unit and future capital expenditures required to meet the revenue growth. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit, which considers the risk inherent in each reporting unit. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of June 1, 2010, and concluded that no impairment charges were required. Total goodwill at June 1, 2010 was $43.4 million. Goodwill is recorded at three of the Companys reporting units. Based on the on the annual impairment test completed as of June 1, 2010, the Company determined that the fair value of two of the reporting units, which represented $24.2 million of the total goodwill, was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting units. The remaining reporting unit, which was acquired in December 2008, had goodwill of $19.2 million at June 1, 2010. The fair value of this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of this unit by more than 20%. However, this is a relatively recent acquisition that was purchased prior to the economic slowdown and the disruptive events in the credit markets. The estimates and assumptions made in the Companys estimate of the fair value of this reporting unit are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding discount rate utilized, revenue growth, expected operating profit margins, and working capital requirements. The following is a summary analysis of the significant assumptions used by the Company to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit using the income approach and how the assumptions were developed: Discount rate: The discount rate represents the expected return on capital and is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. The discount rate used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit was 16%. This rate considers the risk inherent in the projections used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This rate takes into account the uncertainty about the expected revenue growth of the reporting unit and expected operating margins as well as the past performance of the reporting unit. A change in the discount rate of 1% would indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit remains in excess of the carrying value of the unit. However, it would indicate that the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying value of the reporting unit would be less than 20%. Revenue growth assumptions: Projected annual growth assumptions are based on the Companys and its peers historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the electronic manufacturing services (EMS) industry. The long term expected growth rate for the EMS industry is seven percent. The Company expects sales growth rates for this reporting unit to exceed the long term industry average of seven percent during the next five years as the Company recovers from the economic slowdown in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The growth rates will then normalize to industry rates and the Company used a terminal growth rate of 3% to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company expects the growth rates for the reporting unit to exceed the long term growth rate of the EMS industry because (1) the Company expects that in fiscal year 2011, and fiscal year 2012, existing customers of the reporting unit will recover to their sales rates prior to the economic slowdown, and (2) the Company believes that with access to the Companys larger sales force and more competitive financial strength the reporting unit will be able to attract new customers and gain additional business from existing customers. Operating profit margin assumptions: The forecasted operating profit used in the income approach for the reporting unit is expected to improve in the future years as a result of implementing lean efficiency improvements, leveraging of the Company wide purchasing agreements and leveraging fixed costs. Working Capital assumptions and capital expenditures: Working capital requirements were forecasted based on the reporting units historical performance and considering industry averages. Capital expenditures were forecasted based on current spending plans for the next two fiscal years and on industry averages, thereafter. The Company also used the market approach to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company utilizes the guideline public company method in which valuation pricing multiples are derived from the market share prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, and that are actively traded on a free and open market. The derived multiples are then applied to the reporting units financial metrics producing indications of value, which are correlated to reach a final indication of value. The Company used Earnings before Interest Deprecation and Amortization (EBITDA) multiples based on the last 12 months and for the next 12 months to EBITDA to estimate fair value using a market approach. These multiples range from 5.0 to 7.0 times EBITDA. In addition, the Company included a control premium in this analysis. This resulted in a market value that was within 10% of the estimated fair value using the income approach. The Company believes the market data used in the market approach and the estimated future cash flows and discount rate used in the income approach are reasonable; however, changes in estimates could materially affect the Companys estimates of the fair value of the reporting units and therefore, the results of the Companys impairment analysis. If the current economic conditions deteriorate, causing a decline in the Companys stock price or expected cash flows, impairments to one or more businesses could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis. Any related losses or required write downs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance titled, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles &mdash; a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162. The guidance provides for the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) to become the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Codification did not change U.S. GAAP but reorganizes the accounting literature and was effective for the Companys interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance titled Fair Value Measurements (ASC Topic 820), to clarify the definition of fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures required relative to fair value measurements. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820 on June 30, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities, which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance titled Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefits Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (ASC Topic 715). This guidance addresses the accounting for endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements that provide a benefit to an employee that extends to postretirement periods. The Company adopted ASC Topic 715 on June 30, 2008, which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued guidance titled The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASC Topic 825), to permit all entities to choose to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. In accordance with this guidance, an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses, on items for which the fair value option has been elected, in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 825 on June 30, 2008, which did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance titled Business Combinations (ASC Topic 805), which provides guidance on the accounting and reporting for business combinations. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and was adopted by the Company on June 29, 2009. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance titled Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (ASC Topic 815), which requires companies to disclose their objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, whether or not designated as hedging instruments under ASC Topic 815. ASC Topic 815 was effective for the Company for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009 and did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force 03 6 1 titled Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities that addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting, and therefore need to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance titled Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurement (Accounting Standards Update 2010 06), which requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. This guidance is effective for reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted this guidance effective June 29, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have amaterial impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In August 2009, the FASB issued guidance titled Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value (Accounting Standards Update 2009 5), which states companies determining the fair value of a liability may use the perspective of an investor that holds the related obligation as an asset. This guidance addresses practice difficulties caused by the tension between fair value measurements based on the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such transfers from taking place. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after August 27, 2009, and applies to all fair value measurements of liabilities required by GAAP. No new fair value measurements are required by this guidance. The Company adopted this guidance effective September 28, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB guidance titled Consolidation (ASC Topic 810), which amends previous guidance to require an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives a company a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. An ongoing reassessment of financial responsibility is required, including interests in entities formed prior to the effective date of this guidance. This guidance also eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether a company is the primary beneficiary. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. This guidance will be adopted on June 28, 2010, and the Company does not expect this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance titled Revenue Recognition &ndash; Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (Accounting Standards Update 2009 13), which requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy. The guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method. This guidance should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. This guidance will be adopted on June 28, 2010, and the Company does not expect this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk The Company has no sales offices or facilities outside of the United States. Sales for exports were 10.9% of total sales in fiscal year ended June 27, 2010, and less than 10% of total Company revenue in fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Export sales exceeded 10% of total revenue due to a large contract related to wind power generation equipment. This contract is denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, the Company does not have foreign currency risk associated with the related accounts receivable. Interest Rate Risk As of June 27, 2010, the Company had $37.3 million in total debt. Of the total debt, $28.8 million has a fixed rate through an interest rate swap agreement, and therefore, is not subject to interest rate risk. Another $327,000 is subject to a fixed rate through borrowing agreements and is not subject to interest rate risk. The interest rate on the remaining $8.2 million is subject to fluctuation. If interest rates increased 1%, the additional interest cost to the Company would be approximately $69,000 for one year.
