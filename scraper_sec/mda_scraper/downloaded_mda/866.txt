Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview During 2006, we continued to position the DISH Network as the low price leader in the U.S. pay TV industry, while at the same time offering the highest quality programming, customer service and customer choice possible. We subsidize the cost of equipment and installation, and offer other promotions, to increase our subscriber base. We also focused on increasing distribution of our highly rated DVR and HD equipment, as value ads to drive subscriber growth and retention. As a result, our subscriber base continued to grow. That growth, together with increased average monthly revenue per subscriber, resulted in continued revenue growth. Net income and free cash flow also continued to increase. We believe opportunity exists to continue growing our subscriber base. One of our biggest challenges, and opportunities, is to further improve operating results through better cost control and operating efficiency. Operational Results and Goals Adding new subscribers. During 2006, we added approximately 3.516 million new subscribers, an increase of 3.4% from 2005. We intend to continue adding new subscribers by offering compelling value based consumer promotions. These promotions include offers of free or low cost advanced consumer electronics products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, HD receivers, DVRs, and HD DVRs, as well as programming packages which we believe generally have a better price to value relationship than packages currently offered by most other subscription television providers. However, there are many reasons we may not be able to maintain our current rate of new subscriber growth. For example, many of our competitors are better equipped than we are to offer video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services. Our subscriber growth would also be negatively impacted to the extent our competitors offer more attractive consumer promotions. Minimize existing customer churn. In order to continue to increase our subscriber base we must minimize our rate of customer turnover, or churn. Our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately 1.64%. We attempt to contain churn by offering high quality customer service, low prices, and advanced products and services not available from competitors. We also require service commitments from subscribers and tailor our promotions toward subscribers desiring multiple receivers and advanced products such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers, who tend to remain our customers for longer periods. In addition, we maintain disciplined credit requirements, such as requiring most new subscribers to provide a valid major credit card and to have an acceptable credit score. We also plan to continue to offer advanced products to existing customers through our lease promotions and to initiate other programs to improve our overall subscriber retention. However, there can be no assurance that these and other actions we may take to control churn will be successful. 39 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Reduce costs. We believe that our low cost structure is one of our key competitive advantages and we continue to work aggressively to retain this position. We are attempting to control costs by improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the reliability of our equipment, providing better subscriber education in the use of our products and services, and enhancing our training and quality assurance programs for our in home service and call center representatives. We believe that further standardization of EchoStar receiver systems, introduction of new installation technology and the migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations may reduce in home service and customer service calls. In addition, we hope to further reduce our customer service calls by simplifying processes such as billing and non technical equipment issues. However, these initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain or increase our operational efficiencies and we may not be able to continue to grow our operations cost effectively. We also attempt to reduce subscriber acquisition and retention costs by lowering the overall cost of subsidized equipment we provide to new and existing customers and improving the cost effectiveness of our sales efforts. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment is to lease our receiver systems to new and existing subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Leasing enables us to, among other things, reduce our future subscriber acquisition costs by redeploying equipment returned by disconnected lease subscribers. We are further reducing the cost of subscriber equipment through our design and deployment of EchoStar receivers with multiple tuners that allow the subscriber to receive our DISH Network services in multiple rooms using a single receiver, thereby reducing the number of EchoStar receivers we deploy to each subscriber household. However, our overall costs to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers, including amounts expensed and capitalized, both in the aggregate and on a per subscriber basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions or newer, more expensive consumer electronics products in response to new promotions and products offered by our competitors or for other reasons. In addition, expanded use of new compression technologies, such as MPEG 4 and 8PSK, will inevitably render some portion of our current and future EchoStar receivers obsolete, and we will incur additional costs, which may be substantial, to upgrade or replace these receivers. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. Domestic and international expansion. Finally, we are actively involved in pursuing strategic investment and other new business opportunities both domestically and abroad. These initiatives include, among other things, our recently announced investments in satellite delivered mobile video ventures in China and Korea, as well as investments we make domestically in companies whose products and services complement our core businesses or may be a strategic fit with our new business initiatives. These investments are intended to provide new markets for future revenue and long term strategic growth, as well as opportunities to leverage the introduction of new products and services for the benefit of our core business. However, these investments involve a high degree of risk. They could expose us to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful. 40 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS Subscriber related revenue. Subscriber related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, movie, local, pay per view, and international subscription television services, equipment rental fees, additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers, digital video recorder (DVR) fees, advertising sales, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, equipment upgrade fees, HD programming and other subscriber revenue. Therefore, not all of the amounts we include in Subscriber related revenue are recurring on a monthly basis. Subscriber related revenue also includes revenue from equipment sales, installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Revenue from equipment sales to ATT is deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT is recognized upon completion of the services. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Development and implementation fees received from ATT are being recognized in Subscriber related revenue over the next several years. In order to estimate the amount recognized monthly, we first divide the number of subscribers activated during the month under the ATT agreement by total estimated subscriber activations during the life of the contract. We then multiply this percentage by the total development and implementation fees received from ATT. The resulting estimated amount is recognized monthly as revenue over the estimated average subscriber life. During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency agreement with ATT. We believe our overall economic return is similar under both arrangements. However, the impact of subscriber acquisition on many of our line item business metrics was substantially different under the original ATT agreement, compared to most other sales channels (including the revised ATT agreement). 41 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Among other things, our Subscriber related revenue has been impacted in a number of respects. Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our revised ATT agreement do not generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue from ATT. However, our programming services revenue is greater for subscribers acquired under the revised ATT agreement. Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our original ATT agreement will continue to have a positive impact on Subscriber related revenue over the estimated average life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from ATT will continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the original and revised agreements with ATT. Equipment sales. Equipment sales include sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Equipment sales also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Equipment sales does not include revenue from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related revenue from Equipment sales to Subscriber related revenue. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Other sales. Other sales consist principally of satellite transmission revenue and C band subscription television service revenue. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in home service and call center operations, overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs, residual commissions paid to our distributers, refurbishment and repair costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses. Subscriber related expenses also include the cost of equipment sales, and expenses related to installation and other services from our original agreement with ATT. Cost of equipment sales to ATT are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT are recognized as the services are performed. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Under the revised ATT agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures, rather than in Subscriber related expenses. We are continuing to include in Subscriber related expenses the costs deferred from equipment sales made to ATT. These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the subscribers acquired under the original ATT agreement. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses include costs associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels, satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other related services. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment principally includes costs associated with non DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Cost of sales equipment also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Cost of sales equipment does not include the costs from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related expenses from Cost of sales equipment to Subscriber related expenses and Depreciation and amortization. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Cost of sales other. Cost of sales other principally includes programming and other expenses associated with the C band subscription television service business of SNG and costs related to satellite transmission services. 42 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber acquisition costs. In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. As discussed above, under the revised ATT agreement, equipment and installation costs previously reflected in Subscriber related expenses are being included in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures. SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense line item Subscriber acquisition costs for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our Equivalent SAC for the period by adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other offsetting amounts, as described below, to our Subscriber acquisition cost expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution (MVPD) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only Equivalent SAC, which we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program, as described in that Form 10 Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006, our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the current period calculation. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non cash, stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other income (expense). The main components of Other income and expense are unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, and impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) plus Interest expense net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our retail networks, including our co branding relationship with ATT and other distribution relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for co branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, Americas Top 100 (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable.

Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Reduce costs. We believe that our low cost structure is one of our key competitive advantages and we continue to work aggressively to retain this position. We are attempting to control costs by improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the reliability of our equipment, providing better subscriber education in the use of our products and services, and enhancing our training and quality assurance programs for our in home service and call center representatives. We believe that further standardization of EchoStar receiver systems, introduction of new installation technology and the migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations may reduce in home service and customer service calls. In addition, we hope to further reduce our customer service calls by simplifying processes such as billing and non technical equipment issues. However, these initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain or increase our operational efficiencies and we may not be able to continue to grow our operations cost effectively. We also attempt to reduce subscriber acquisition and retention costs by lowering the overall cost of subsidized equipment we provide to new and existing customers and improving the cost effectiveness of our sales efforts. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment is to lease our receiver systems to new and existing subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Leasing enables us to, among other things, reduce our future subscriber acquisition costs by redeploying equipment returned by disconnected lease subscribers. We are further reducing the cost of subscriber equipment through our design and deployment of EchoStar receivers with multiple tuners that allow the subscriber to receive our DISH Network services in multiple rooms using a single receiver, thereby reducing the number of EchoStar receivers we deploy to each subscriber household. However, our overall costs to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers, including amounts expensed and capitalized, both in the aggregate and on a per subscriber basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions or newer, more expensive consumer electronics products in response to new promotions and products offered by our competitors or for other reasons. In addition, expanded use of new compression technologies, such as MPEG 4 and 8PSK, will inevitably render some portion of our current and future EchoStar receivers obsolete, and we will incur additional costs, which may be substantial, to upgrade or replace these receivers. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. Domestic and international expansion. Finally, we are actively involved in pursuing strategic investment and other new business opportunities both domestically and abroad. These initiatives include, among other things, our recently announced investments in satellite delivered mobile video ventures in China and Korea, as well as investments we make domestically in companies whose products and services complement our core businesses or may be a strategic fit with our new business initiatives. These investments are intended to provide new markets for future revenue and long term strategic growth, as well as opportunities to leverage the introduction of new products and services for the benefit of our core business. However, these investments involve a high degree of risk. They could expose us to significant financial losses if the underlying ventures are not successful. 40 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS Subscriber related revenue. Subscriber related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, movie, local, pay per view, and international subscription television services, equipment rental fees, additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers, digital video recorder (DVR) fees, advertising sales, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, equipment upgrade fees, HD programming and other subscriber revenue. Therefore, not all of the amounts we include in Subscriber related revenue are recurring on a monthly basis. Subscriber related revenue also includes revenue from equipment sales, installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Revenue from equipment sales to ATT is deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT is recognized upon completion of the services. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Development and implementation fees received from ATT are being recognized in Subscriber related revenue over the next several years. In order to estimate the amount recognized monthly, we first divide the number of subscribers activated during the month under the ATT agreement by total estimated subscriber activations during the life of the contract. We then multiply this percentage by the total development and implementation fees received from ATT. The resulting estimated amount is recognized monthly as revenue over the estimated average subscriber life. During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency agreement with ATT. We believe our overall economic return is similar under both arrangements. However, the impact of subscriber acquisition on many of our line item business metrics was substantially different under the original ATT agreement, compared to most other sales channels (including the revised ATT agreement). 41 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Among other things, our Subscriber related revenue has been impacted in a number of respects. Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our revised ATT agreement do not generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue from ATT. However, our programming services revenue is greater for subscribers acquired under the revised ATT agreement. Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our original ATT agreement will continue to have a positive impact on Subscriber related revenue over the estimated average life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from ATT will continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the original and revised agreements with ATT. Equipment sales. Equipment sales include sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Equipment sales also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Equipment sales does not include revenue from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related revenue from Equipment sales to Subscriber related revenue. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Other sales. Other sales consist principally of satellite transmission revenue and C band subscription television service revenue. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in home service and call center operations, overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs, residual commissions paid to our distributers, refurbishment and repair costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses. Subscriber related expenses also include the cost of equipment sales, and expenses related to installation and other services from our original agreement with ATT. Cost of equipment sales to ATT are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT are recognized as the services are performed. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Under the revised ATT agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures, rather than in Subscriber related expenses. We are continuing to include in Subscriber related expenses the costs deferred from equipment sales made to ATT. These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the subscribers acquired under the original ATT agreement. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses include costs associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels, satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other related services. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment principally includes costs associated with non DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Cost of sales equipment also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Cost of sales equipment does not include the costs from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related expenses from Cost of sales equipment to Subscriber related expenses and Depreciation and amortization. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Cost of sales other. Cost of sales other principally includes programming and other expenses associated with the C band subscription television service business of SNG and costs related to satellite transmission services. 42 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber acquisition costs. In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. As discussed above, under the revised ATT agreement, equipment and installation costs previously reflected in Subscriber related expenses are being included in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures. SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense line item Subscriber acquisition costs for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our Equivalent SAC for the period by adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other offsetting amounts, as described below, to our Subscriber acquisition cost expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution (MVPD) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only Equivalent SAC, which we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program, as described in that Form 10 Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006, our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the current period calculation. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non cash, stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other income (expense). The main components of Other income and expense are unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, and impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) plus Interest expense net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our retail networks, including our co branding relationship with ATT and other distribution relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for co branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, Americas Top 100 (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $914.8 million reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the Tivo litigation charge discussed above. 49 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Annual Quarterly/Semi Annual Debt Service Payment Dates Requirements* 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2010 June 30 and December 31 $ 15,000,000 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2008 April 1 and October 1 $ 57,500,000 6 3/8% Senior Notes due 2011 April 1 and October 1 $ 63,750,000 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2011 June 30 and December 31 $ 750,000 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 April 1 and October 1 $ 66,250,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016 February 1 and August 1 $ 106,875,000 7 % Senior Notes due 2013 April 1 and October 1 $ 35,000,000 * The table above does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued EXPLANATION OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER ITEMS Subscriber related revenue. Subscriber related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic, movie, local, pay per view, and international subscription television services, equipment rental fees, additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers, digital video recorder (DVR) fees, advertising sales, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, equipment upgrade fees, HD programming and other subscriber revenue. Therefore, not all of the amounts we include in Subscriber related revenue are recurring on a monthly basis. Subscriber related revenue also includes revenue from equipment sales, installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Revenue from equipment sales to ATT is deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Revenue from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT is recognized upon completion of the services. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Development and implementation fees received from ATT are being recognized in Subscriber related revenue over the next several years. In order to estimate the amount recognized monthly, we first divide the number of subscribers activated during the month under the ATT agreement by total estimated subscriber activations during the life of the contract. We then multiply this percentage by the total development and implementation fees received from ATT. The resulting estimated amount is recognized monthly as revenue over the estimated average subscriber life. During the fourth quarter 2005, we modified and extended our distribution and sales agency agreement with ATT. We believe our overall economic return is similar under both arrangements. However, the impact of subscriber acquisition on many of our line item business metrics was substantially different under the original ATT agreement, compared to most other sales channels (including the revised ATT agreement). 41 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Among other things, our Subscriber related revenue has been impacted in a number of respects. Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our revised ATT agreement do not generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue from ATT. However, our programming services revenue is greater for subscribers acquired under the revised ATT agreement. Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our original ATT agreement will continue to have a positive impact on Subscriber related revenue over the estimated average life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from ATT will continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the original and revised agreements with ATT. Equipment sales. Equipment sales include sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Equipment sales also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Equipment sales does not include revenue from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related revenue from Equipment sales to Subscriber related revenue. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Other sales. Other sales consist principally of satellite transmission revenue and C band subscription television service revenue. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in home service and call center operations, overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs, residual commissions paid to our distributers, refurbishment and repair costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses. Subscriber related expenses also include the cost of equipment sales, and expenses related to installation and other services from our original agreement with ATT. Cost of equipment sales to ATT are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT are recognized as the services are performed. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Under the revised ATT agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures, rather than in Subscriber related expenses. We are continuing to include in Subscriber related expenses the costs deferred from equipment sales made to ATT. These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the subscribers acquired under the original ATT agreement. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses include costs associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels, satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other related services. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment principally includes costs associated with non DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Cost of sales equipment also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Cost of sales equipment does not include the costs from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related expenses from Cost of sales equipment to Subscriber related expenses and Depreciation and amortization. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Cost of sales other. Cost of sales other principally includes programming and other expenses associated with the C band subscription television service business of SNG and costs related to satellite transmission services. 42 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber acquisition costs. In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. As discussed above, under the revised ATT agreement, equipment and installation costs previously reflected in Subscriber related expenses are being included in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures. SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense line item Subscriber acquisition costs for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our Equivalent SAC for the period by adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other offsetting amounts, as described below, to our Subscriber acquisition cost expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution (MVPD) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only Equivalent SAC, which we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program, as described in that Form 10 Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006, our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the current period calculation. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non cash, stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other income (expense). The main components of Other income and expense are unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, and impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) plus Interest expense net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our retail networks, including our co branding relationship with ATT and other distribution relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for co branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, Americas Top 100 (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable.

Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Among other things, our Subscriber related revenue has been impacted in a number of respects. Commencing in the fourth quarter 2005, new subscribers acquired under our revised ATT agreement do not generate equipment sales, installation or other services revenue from ATT. However, our programming services revenue is greater for subscribers acquired under the revised ATT agreement. Deferred equipment sales revenue relating to subscribers acquired through our original ATT agreement will continue to have a positive impact on Subscriber related revenue over the estimated average life of those subscribers. Further, development and implementation fees received from ATT will continue to be recognized over the estimated average subscriber life of all subscribers acquired under both the original and revised agreements with ATT. Equipment sales. Equipment sales include sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Equipment sales also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Equipment sales does not include revenue from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related revenue from Equipment sales to Subscriber related revenue. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Other sales. Other sales consist principally of satellite transmission revenue and C band subscription television service revenue. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses principally include programming expenses, costs incurred in connection with our in home service and call center operations, overhead costs associated with our installation business, copyright royalties, billing costs, residual commissions paid to our distributers, refurbishment and repair costs related to EchoStar receiver systems, subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses. Subscriber related expenses also include the cost of equipment sales, and expenses related to installation and other services from our original agreement with ATT. Cost of equipment sales to ATT are deferred and recognized over the estimated average co branded subscriber life. Expenses from installation and certain other services performed at the request of ATT are recognized as the services are performed. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Under the revised ATT agreement, we are including costs from equipment and installations in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures, rather than in Subscriber related expenses. We are continuing to include in Subscriber related expenses the costs deferred from equipment sales made to ATT. These costs are being amortized over the estimated life of the subscribers acquired under the original ATT agreement. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses include costs associated with the operation of our digital broadcast centers, the transmission of local channels, satellite telemetry, tracking and control services, satellite and transponder leases, and other related services. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment principally includes costs associated with non DISH Network digital receivers and related components sold to an international DBS service provider and to other international customers. Cost of sales equipment also includes unsubsidized sales of DBS accessories to retailers and other distributors of our equipment domestically and to DISH Network subscribers. Cost of sales equipment does not include the costs from sales of equipment to ATT. Effective the second quarter of 2006, we reclassified certain warranty and service related expenses from Cost of sales equipment to Subscriber related expenses and Depreciation and amortization. All prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Cost of sales other. Cost of sales other principally includes programming and other expenses associated with the C band subscription television service business of SNG and costs related to satellite transmission services. 42 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber acquisition costs. In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. As discussed above, under the revised ATT agreement, equipment and installation costs previously reflected in Subscriber related expenses are being included in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures. SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense line item Subscriber acquisition costs for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our Equivalent SAC for the period by adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other offsetting amounts, as described below, to our Subscriber acquisition cost expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution (MVPD) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only Equivalent SAC, which we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program, as described in that Form 10 Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006, our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the current period calculation. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non cash, stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other income (expense). The main components of Other income and expense are unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, and impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) plus Interest expense net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our retail networks, including our co branding relationship with ATT and other distribution relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for co branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, Americas Top 100 (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber acquisition costs. In addition to leasing receivers, we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of EchoStar receiver systems in order to attract new DISH Network subscribers. Our Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of EchoStar receiver systems sold to retailers and other distributors of our equipment, the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers, net costs related to our promotional incentives, and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising. We exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers from Subscriber acquisition costs. As discussed above, under the revised ATT agreement, equipment and installation costs previously reflected in Subscriber related expenses are being included in Subscriber acquisition costs or in capital expenditures. SAC. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation, or SAC, and we believe presentations of SAC may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We include all new DISH Network subscribers in our calculation, including DISH Network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs. Prior to January 1, 2006, we calculated SAC for the period by dividing the amount of our expense line item Subscriber acquisition costs for the period, by our gross new DISH Network subscribers added during that period. Separately, we then disclosed our Equivalent SAC for the period by adding the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, and other offsetting amounts, as described below, to our Subscriber acquisition cost expense line item prior to dividing by our gross new subscriber number. Management believes subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution (MVPD) industry. Because our Equivalent SAC includes all of the costs of acquiring subscribers (i.e., subsidized and capitalized equipment), our management focuses on Equivalent SAC as the more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire new subscribers. As such, effective January 1, 2006, we began disclosing only Equivalent SAC, which we now refer to as SAC. SAC is now calculated as Subscriber acquisition costs, plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers, divided by gross subscriber additions. During the first quarter of 2006, we included in our calculation of SAC the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program, as described in that Form 10 Q. Effective the second quarter of 2006, our revised SAC calculation no longer includes these benefits. Instead, these benefits are separately disclosed. All prior period SAC calculations have been revised to conform to the current period calculation. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal, information systems, accounting and finance, including non cash, stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (As Amended), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). It also includes outside professional fees (i.e. legal and accounting services) and other items associated with facilities and administration. Interest expense. Interest expense primarily includes interest expense, prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities (net of capitalized interest) and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations. Other income (expense). The main components of Other income and expense are unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value, equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates, gains and losses realized on the sale of investments, and impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) plus Interest expense net of Interest income, Taxes and Depreciation and amortization. DISH Network subscribers. We include customers obtained through direct sales, and through our retail networks, including our co branding relationship with ATT and other distribution relationships, in our DISH Network subscriber count. We believe our overall economic return for co branded and traditional subscribers will be comparable. We also provide DISH Network service to hotels, motels and other commercial accounts. For certain of these commercial accounts, we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately 43 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued equal to the retail price of our most widely distributed programming package, Americas Top 100 (but taking into account, periodically, price changes and other factors), and include the resulting number, which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served, in our DISH Network subscriber count. During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable.

Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

During April 2004, we acquired a C band subscription television service business, the assets of which primarily consist of acquired customer relationships. Although we are converting some of these customer relationships from C band subscription television services to our DISH Network DBS subscription television service, acquired C band subscribers are not included in our DISH Network subscriber count unless they have also subscribed to our DISH Network DBS television service. Monthly average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating ARPU and believe presentations of ARPU may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing average monthly Subscriber related revenues for the period (total Subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period) by our average DISH Network subscribers for the period. Average DISH Network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average DISH Network subscribers for each month and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending DISH Network subscribers for the month and dividing by two. Subscriber churn rate/subscriber turnover. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses. We calculate percentage monthly subscriber churn by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminate service during each month by total DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of that month. We calculate average subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of DISH Network subscribers who terminated service during that period by the average number of DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period, and further dividing by the number of months in the period. Average DISH Network subscribers subject to churn during the period are calculated by adding the DISH Network subscribers as of the beginning of each month in the period and dividing by the total number of months in the period. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 44 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $914.8 million reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the Tivo litigation charge discussed above. 49 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable.

Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,369,058 $ 2,142,990 Less: Interest expense, net 331,749 330,326 Income tax provision (benefit), net 314,743 (507,449 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,114,294 805,573 Net income (loss) $ 608,272 $ 1,514,540 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 13.105 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 12.040 million subscribers at December 31, 2005, an increase of 8.8%. DISH Network added approximately 3.516 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers during 2005, an increase of approximately 119,000. The increase in gross new subscribers resulted in large part from increased advertising and the effectiveness of our promotions and products during the year. A substantial majority of our gross new subscribers are acquired through our equipment lease program. DISH Network added approximately 1.065 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers during 2005, a decrease of 6.2%. This decrease was primarily a result of subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base. As the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Our gross new subscribers, our net new subscriber additions, and our entire subscriber base are negatively impacted when existing and new competitors offer more attractive alternatives, including, among other things, video services bundled with broadband and other telecommunications services, better priced or more attractive programming packages or more compelling consumer electronic products and services, including DVRs, VOD services, receivers with multiple tuners, HD programming, or HD and standard definition local channels. We also expect to face increasing competition from content and other providers who distribute video services directly to consumers over the Internet. In addition, we will be unable to continue to grow our subscriber base at current rates if we cannot control our customer churn. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $9.376 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $1.389 billion or 17.4% compared to 2005. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $62.47 during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $58.04 during the same period in 2005. The $4.43 or 7.6% increase in ARPU was primarily attributable to price increases in February 2006 and 2005 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, fees for DVRs, revenue from increased availability of standard and HD local channels by satellite, fees earned from our DishHOME Protection Plan, and HD programming. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Equipment sales totaled $362.1 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 1.6% compared to 2005. This decrease principally resulted from a decline in domestic sales of DBS accessories, partially offset by an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to international customers. While we currently have certain binding purchase orders from Bell ExpressVu and others through mid year 2007, we anticipate that 2007 sales could decline compared to 2006. In addition, the availability of new compression technology could impact our relationship with Bell ExpressVu depending on its strategy to upgrade customers. There can be no assurance that Bell ExpressVu will continue to use our equipment in the future. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.808 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $711.9 million or 17.4% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers together with an increase in refurbishment and repair costs for returned EchoStar receiver systems, partially offset by the decline in costs associated with installation and other services related to our original agreement with ATT. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% of Subscriber related revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In the normal course of business, we enter into various contracts with programmers to provide content. Our programming contracts generally require us to make payments based on the number of subscribers to which the respective content is provided. Consequently, our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base. In addition, because programmers continue to raise the price of content, our 46 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,369,058 $ 2,142,990 Less: Interest expense, net 331,749 330,326 Income tax provision (benefit), net 314,743 (507,449 ) Depreciation and amortization 1,114,294 805,573 Net income (loss) $ 608,272 $ 1,514,540 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Subscriber related expenses as a percentage of Subscriber related revenue could materially increase absent corresponding price increases in our DISH Network programming packages. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $147.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $12.9 million or 9.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from higher operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.6% and 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $282.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $10.7 million or 3.9% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales equipment represented 78.0% and 73.8% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to higher charges for defective, slow moving and obsolete inventory in 2006. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.596 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $103.7 million or 6.9% compared to 2005. The increase in Subscriber acquisition costs was primarily attributable to an increase in gross new subscribers and a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs. This increase was also attributable to higher installation and acquisition advertising costs, partially offset by a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers. The introduction of new equipment resulted in a decrease in our cost per installation during 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a result of increased volume, our overall installation expense increased. SAC. SAC was $686 during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $693 during 2005, a decrease of $7, or 1.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the equipment redeployment benefits of our equipment lease programs, discussed below, and lower average equipment and installation costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement and higher acquisition advertising costs. As previously discussed, the calculation of SAC for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Our principal method for reducing the cost of subscriber equipment, which is included in SAC, is to lease our receiver systems to new subscribers rather than selling systems to them at little or no cost. Upon termination of service, lease subscribers are required to return the leased equipment to us or be charged for the equipment. Leased equipment that is returned to us which we redeploy to new lease customers, results in reduced capital expenditures, and thus reduced SAC. The percentage of our new subscribers choosing to lease rather than purchase equipment continued to increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled $816.5 million and $861.5 million, respectively. This decrease in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from lower hardware costs per receiver, fewer receivers per installation as the number of dual tuner receivers we install continues to increase, increased redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers, and a reduction in accessory costs related to the introduction of less costly installation technology and our migration away from relatively expensive and complex subscriber equipment installations. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete, we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and would realize less benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. 47 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable.

Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, these amounts totaled $120.5 million and $86.1 million, respectively. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, both in aggregate and on a per new subscriber activation basis, may materially increase in the future to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions if we determine that they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. See further discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Subscriber Retention and Acquisition Costs. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $551.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $95.3 million or 20.9% compared to 2005. This increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs to support the growth of the DISH Network, including, among other things, non cash, stock based compensation expense recorded related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, outside professional fees and non income based taxes. General and administrative expenses represented 5.6% and 5.4% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the ratio of those expenses to Total revenue was primarily attributable to increased infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network, discussed above. Tivo litigation expense. We recorded $94.0 million of Tivo litigation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 as a result of the jury verdict in the Tivo lawsuit. Based on our current analysis of the case, including the appellate record and other factors, we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail on appeal. Consequently, only the expense related to the original judgment has been accrued. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $1.114 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $308.7 million or 38.3% compared to 2005. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to depreciation of equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs, additional depreciation related to satellites placed in service and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Interest income. Interest income totaled $126.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $82.9 million compared to 2005. This increase principally resulted from higher cash and marketable investment securities balances and higher total percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities during 2006. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $458.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $84.3 million or 22.6% compared to 2005. This increase primarily resulted from a net increase in interest expense of $65.1 million related to the issuance of additional senior debt during 2006, net of redemptions, and an increase in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $28.7 million, related to the redemption of certain outstanding senior debt during 2006. This increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest on construction of satellites. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.369 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $226.0 million or 10.5% compared to 2005. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement and the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by the $94.0 million Tivo litigation expense. Absent these items, our EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $454.0 million or 22.6% higher than EBITDA in 2005. The increase in EBITDA (excluding these items) was primarily attributable to changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. 48 Table of Contents Item 7.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was favorably impacted by the $914.8 million reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the $134.0 million Gain on insurance settlement. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was unfavorably impacted by the Tivo litigation charge discussed above. 49 Table of Contents Item 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax provision was $314.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a benefit of $507.4 million during 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005 included credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance. The year ended December 31, 2006 includes a credit of $13.5 million related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for prior periods. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2006, includes a credit of $8.3 million related to amended state filings. During 2007, we expect our income tax provision to reflect statutory Federal and state tax rates.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable.

Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued DISH Network subscribers. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 12.040 million DISH Network subscribers compared to approximately 10.905 million subscribers at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately 10.4%. DISH Network added approximately 3.397 million gross new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 3.441 million gross new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 44,000 gross new subscribers. The decrease in gross new subscribers resulted primarily from a decline in gross activations under our co branding agreement with ATT, partially offset by an increase in sales through our agency relationships and an increase in our other distribution channels. DISH Network added approximately 1.135 million net new subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 1.480 million net new subscribers during 2004, a decrease of approximately 23.3%. This decrease was primarily a result of increased subscriber churn on a larger subscriber base, and the result of a decline in gross and net activations under our co branding agreement with ATT. In addition, even if percentage subscriber churn had remained constant or had declined, increasing numbers of gross new subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Subscriber related revenue. DISH Network Subscriber related revenue totaled $7.986 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.293 billion or 19.3% compared to 2004. This increase was directly attributable to continued DISH Network subscriber growth and the increase in ARPU discussed below. ARPU. Monthly average revenue per subscriber was $58.04 during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $55.00 during the same period in 2004. The $3.04 or 5.5% increase in monthly average revenue per DISH Network subscriber is primarily attributable to price increases in February 2005 and 2004 on some of our most popular packages, higher equipment rental fees resulting from increased penetration of our equipment leasing programs, availability of local channels by satellite and fees for DVRs. This increase was also attributable to our relationship with ATT, including revenues from equipment sales, installation and other services related to that agreement. These improvements in ARPU were partially offset by an increase in our free and discounted programming promotions. We provided local channels by satellite in 164 markets as of December 31, 2005 compared to 152 markets as of December 31, 2004. We regularly have promotions to acquire new DISH Network subscribers which provide free and or discounted programming that negatively impact ARPU. Equipment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2005, Equipment sales totaled $368.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 0.8% compared to the same period during 2004. This increase principally resulted from an increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider, partially offset by decreases in sales of DBS accessories domestically. Subscriber related expenses. Subscriber related expenses totaled $4.096 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $477.7 million or 13.2% compared to 2004. The increase in Subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers, which resulted in increased expenses to support the DISH Network. Subscriber related expenses represented 51.3% and 54.1% of Subscriber related revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from the increase in Subscriber related revenue and an increase in the number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our lease program for existing subscribers. Since certain subscriber retention costs associated with this program are capitalized rather than expensed, our Subscriber related expenses decreased and our capital expenditures increased. The decrease in the ratio also resulted from improved efficiencies associated with our installation and in home service operations. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio was partially offset by increases in cost associated with deferred equipment sales, installation and other services related to our relationship under our prior agreement with ATT. The decrease in the ratio was also partially offset by $15.7 million more in charges during 2005 compared to 2004 for the replacement of smart cards. Satellite and transmission expenses. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled $134.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $22.3 million or 19.9% compared to 2004. This increase primarily resulted from commencement of service and operational costs associated with the increasing number of markets in which we offer local broadcast channels by satellite as previously discussed, increases in our satellite lease payment obligations for AMC 2, and operational costs associated with our capital leases of AMC 15 and AMC 16 which commenced commercial operation in January and February 2005, respectively. Satellite and transmission expenses totaled 1.7% of Subscriber related revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 51 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued 2004. These expenses will increase further in the future as we increase the size of our satellite fleet, if we obtain in orbit satellite insurance, as we increase the number and operations of our digital broadcast centers and as additional local markets and other programming services are launched. Cost of sales equipment. Cost of sales equipment totaled $271.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $12.6 million or 4.9% compared to 2004. This increase related primarily to the increase in sales of non DISH Network digital receivers and related components to an international DBS service provider. Charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory were lower during 2005 compared to 2004. This difference, together with the decrease in sales of DBS accessories domestically discussed above, partially offset the amount of the increase. Cost of sales equipment represented 73.8% and 71.0% of Equipment sales, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the expense to revenue ratio principally related to a decline in margins on sales to the international DBS service provider and on sales of DBS accessories domestically. This increase was partially offset by the lower 2005 charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Subscriber acquisition costs. Subscriber acquisition costs totaled $1.493 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $35.3 million or 2.3% compared to 2004. The decrease in Subscriber acquisition costs was attributable to a higher number of DISH Network subscribers participating in our equipment lease program for new subscribers, partially offset by an increase in the number of non co branded subscribers acquired and an increase in acquisition advertising. SAC. SAC was $693 during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $611 during 2004, an increase of $82, or 13.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of co branded subscribers acquired under our original ATT agreement, for which we did not incur subscriber acquisition costs and a greater number of DISH Network subscribers activating higher priced advanced products, such as receivers with multiple tuners, DVRs and HD receivers. Activation of these more advanced and complex products also resulted in higher installation costs during 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in SAC was also attributable to higher costs for acquisition advertising and promotional incentives paid to our independent dealer network. Penetration of our equipment lease program for new subscribers increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled approximately $861.5 million and $574.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in leased equipment and related reduction in subsidized equipment sales caused our capital expenditures to increase, while our Subscriber acquisition costs declined. As previously discussed, our SAC calculation does not include the benefit of payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale rather than being redeployed through our lease program. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $86.1 million and $60.8 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $456.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $57.3 million or 14.4% compared to 2004. The increase in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and infrastructure expenses to support the growth of the DISH Network. General and administrative expenses represented 5.4% and 5.6% of Total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in this expense to revenue ratio resulted primarily from Total revenue increasing at a higher rate than our General and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $805.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $300.0 million or 59.3% compared to 2004. The increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to additional depreciation on equipment leased to subscribers resulting from increased penetration of our equipment lease programs and other depreciable assets placed in service to support the DISH Network. Further, depreciation of our AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites, which commenced commercial operation during January and February 2005, respectively, contributed to this increase. 52 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. Interest expense totaled $373.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $131.9 million or 26.1% compared to 2004. This decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in prepayment premiums and write off of debt issuance costs totaling $134.4 million, and a net reduction in interest expense of $40.2 million related to the redemption, repurchases and refinancing of our previously outstanding senior debt which occurred during 2004. This decrease was partially offset by $38.0 million of additional interest expense during 2005 associated with our capital lease obligations for the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites. Gain on insurance settlement. During March 2005, we settled an insurance claim and related claims for accrued interest and bad faith with the insurers of our EchoStar IV satellite for the net amount of $240.0 million. The $134.0 million received in excess of our previously recorded $106.0 million receivable related to this insurance claim was recognized as a Gain on insurance settlement during the year ended December 31, 2005. Other. Other income totaled $36.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to Other expense of $13.5 million during 2004. The increase of $49.7 million primarily resulted from a $38.8 million unrealized gain for the change in fair value of a non marketable strategic investment accounted for at fair value and $28.4 million in gains related to the conversion of bond instruments into common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. These gains were partially offset by a $25.4 million charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of an investment in the marketable common stock of a company in the home entertainment industry during the fourth quarter of 2005. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA was $2.143 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $947.6 million or 79.3% compared to $1.195 billion during 2004. The increase in EBITDA was primarily attributable to the changes in operating revenues and expenses discussed above. The following table reconciles EBITDA to the accompanying financial statements: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) EBITDA $ 2,142,990 $ 1,195,384 Less: Interest expense, net 330,326 463,445 Income tax provision (benefit), net (507,449 ) 11,609 Depreciation and amortization 805,573 505,561 Net income (loss) $ 1,514,540 $ 214,769 EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the multi channel video programming distribution industry. Conceptually, EBITDA measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt, pay taxes and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 53 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Income tax benefit (provision), net. Our income tax benefit was $507.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to an income tax provision of $11.6 million during 2004. This decrease was primarily related to credits of $592.8 million and $322.0 million to our provision for income taxes in 2005 resulting from the reversal and current year activity, respectively, of our recorded valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not to be realizable. For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 (In thousands) Adjusted income tax benefit (provision), net $ (378,687 ) $ (93,771 ) Less: Valuation allowance reversal (592,804 ) Current year valuation allowance activity (321,982 ) (76,786 ) Deferred tax asset for filed returns 28,650 (5,376 ) Income tax benefit (provision), net $ 507,449 $ (11,609 ) Net income (loss). Net income was $1.515 billion during the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $1.300 billion compared to $214.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the reversal of our recorded valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, higher Operating income, the Gain on insurance settlement and lower Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of cash during 2006 were operating activities and the issuance of long term notes. Our principal uses of cash during 2006 were to purchase property and equipment, redemption of certain of our long term notes and purchases of marketable investment securities. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, the $1.0 billion principal amount of the notes was redeemed at a redemption price of 101.643% of the principal amount, for a total of $1.016 billion. The premium paid of $16.4 million, along with unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.6 million, were recorded as charges to earnings in February 2007. We expect that our future working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash and investment balances and cash generated from operations. Our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to retain existing DISH Network subscribers. There can be no assurance we will be successful in executing our business plan. The amount of capital required to fund our 2007 working capital and capital expenditure needs will vary, depending, among other things, on the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention, including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs. The amount of capital required in 2007 will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to support growth in the DISH Network, our wholesale commercial fixed satellite service business and other strategic initiatives, previously discussed. We currently anticipate that 2007 capital expenditures will be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion due to, among other things, increased spending on equipment leased to subscribers and expenditures on satellites. Our capital expenditures will vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of increased competition for subscription television customers, significant satellite failures, in the event we make strategic investments or acquisitions, or in the event of general economic downturn, among other factors. These factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities. We consider all liquid investments purchased within 90 days of their maturity to be cash equivalents. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities. As of December 31, 2006, our 54 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Annual Quarterly/Semi Annual Debt Service Payment Dates Requirements* 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2010 June 30 and December 31 $ 15,000,000 5 3/4% Senior Notes due 2008 April 1 and October 1 $ 57,500,000 6 3/8% Senior Notes due 2011 April 1 and October 1 $ 63,750,000 3% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2011 June 30 and December 31 $ 750,000 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 April 1 and October 1 $ 66,250,000 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016 February 1 and August 1 $ 106,875,000 7 % Senior Notes due 2013 April 1 and October 1 $ 35,000,000 * The table above does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities totaled $3.206 billion, including $172.9 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, compared to $1.248 billion, including $67.1 million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities, as of December 31, 2005. The following discussion highlights our free cash flow and cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as Net cash flows from operating activities less Purchases of property and equipment, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments, fund acquisitions and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for Operating income, Net income, Net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets, we believe this non GAAP liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable GAAP measure Net cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities as shown in the Net cash flows from operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included herein. Operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods, since these changes depend upon, among other things, managements timing of payments and control of inventory levels, and cash receipts. In addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities, free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon, among other things, subscriber growth, subscriber revenue, subscriber churn, subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs, operating efficiencies, increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment and other factors. The following table reconciles free cash flow to Net cash flows from operating activities. For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Free Cash Flow $ 882,924 $ 267,680 $ 20,855 Add back: Purchases of property and equipment 1,396,318 1,506,394 980,587 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 2,279,242 $ 1,774,074 $ 1,001,442 Free cash flow was $882.9 million, $267.7 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 of $615.2 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $505.1 million, or 28.5%, and a decrease in Purchases of property and equipment of $110.1 million, or 7.3%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a $328.4 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; and (iii) Depreciation and amortization expense. A $168.4 million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase. The 2006 decrease in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to a decline in overall capital expenditures, including satellite construction, and equipment under our new subscriber lease program, partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our existing subscriber lease program. The improvement in free cash flow from 2004 to 2005 of $246.8 million resulted from an increase in Net cash flows from operating activities of $772.6 million, or 77.2%, partially offset by an increase in Purchases of property and equipment of $525.8 million, or 53.6%. The increase in Net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to an $864.2 million increase in net income, net of changes in: (i) Deferred tax expense (benefit); (ii) Gain on insurance settlement; (iii) Realized and unrealized losses (gains) on investments; and (iv) Depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $77.7 million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in Purchases of property and equipment was primarily attributable to increased spending for equipment under our new and existing lease programs, and satellite construction, partially offset by a decline in overall corporate capital expenditures. 55 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Our future capital expenditures could increase or decrease depending on the strength of the economy, strategic opportunities or other factors. Cash flows from operating activities. We typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash flows from operating activities of $2.279 billion, $1.774 billion, and $1.001 billion, respectively. See discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in Free cash flow above. Cash flows from investing activities. Our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of $1.994 billion and $1.460 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported net cash inflows from investing activities of $1.078 billion. The decrease in cash flow from investing activities from 2005 to 2006 of $533.6 million primarily resulted from an increase in net purchases of marketable investment securities; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures during 2006. Cash flow from investing activities for 2005 was favorably impacted by a $240.0 million insurance settlement. The decrease from 2004 to 2005 of $2.538 billion primarily resulted from a decrease in net sales of marketable investment securities and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures during 2005. The decrease in net cash flows from investing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash due to the insurance settlement of $240.0 million previously disclosed and the decrease in asset acquisitions during 2005. Cash flows from financing activities. Our financing activities include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt, and cash used for the repurchase or redemption of long term debt, and capital lease obligations, mortgages or other notes payable, repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of $1.022 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of $402.6 million and $2.666 billion, respectively. The improvement from 2005 to 2006 of $1.425 billion principally resulted from the following: On February 2, 2006, we sold $1.5 billion principal amount of our 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2016. On October 18, 2006, we sold $500.0 million principal amount of our 7% Senior Notes due 2013. On February 17, 2006, we redeemed the remaining $442.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9 1/8% Senior Notes due 2009. On October 1, 2006, we redeemed the $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of our Rate Senior Notes due 2008. During 2006, we repurchased approximately 429,000 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $11.7 million compared to approximately 13.2 million shares at a total cost of $362.5 million during 2005. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 of $2.263 billion principally resulted from the following: During 2004, we redeemed the remaining $1.423 billion outstanding principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 and our $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of the 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2007. 56 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued During 2004, we paid a cash dividend of $455.7 million to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. During 2005, we repurchased approximately 13.2 million shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions for a total cost of $362.5 million compared to approximately 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $809.6 million during 2004. The improvement from 2004 to 2005 was partially offset by the following financing sources of cash: During 2004, we sold $1.0 billion principal amount of our 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 and $25.0 million 3% Convertible Subordinated Note due 2011 to CenturyTel Service Group L.L.C. Other Liquidity Items Subscriber turnover. Our percentage monthly subscriber churn for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 1.64%, compared to percentage subscriber churn for 2005 of 1.65%. Our future subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to, an increase in competition from existing competitors and new entrants offering more compelling promotions, as well as new advanced products and services. Competitor bundling of video services with 2 way high speed Internet access and telephone services may contribute more significantly to churn over time. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not contribute to relatively higher churn than we have experienced historically. Additionally, certain of our promotions allow consumers with relatively lower credit scores to become subscribers, and these subscribers typically churn at a higher rate. However, these subscribers are also acquired at a lower cost resulting in a smaller economic loss upon disconnect. Additionally, as the size of our subscriber base increases, even if our churn percentage remains constant or declines, increasing numbers of gross new DISH Network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth. Increases in theft of our signal, or our competitors signals, also could cause subscriber churn to increase in future periods. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. If we are required to replace existing smart cards, the cost could exceed $100.0 million. Subscriber acquisition and retention costs. Our subscriber acquisition and retention costs can vary significantly from period to period which can in turn cause significant variability to our net income (loss) and free cash flow between periods. Our Subscriber acquisition costs, SAC and Subscriber related expenses may materially increase to the extent that we introduce more aggressive promotions in the future if we determine they are necessary to respond to competition, or for other reasons. Capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers have been, and we expect will continue to be, partially mitigated by, among other things, the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers. However, to remain competitive we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes, and the associated costs may be substantial. To the extent technological changes render existing equipment obsolete, we would cease to benefit from the SAC reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment. Several years ago, we began deploying satellite receivers capable of exploiting 8PSK modulation technology. Since that technology is now standard in all of our new satellite receivers, our cost to migrate programming channels to that technology in the future will be substantially lower than if it were necessary to replace all existing consumer equipment. As we continue to implement 8PSK technology, bandwidth efficiency will improve, significantly increasing the number of programming channels we can transmit over our existing satellites as an alternative or supplement to the acquisition of additional spectrum or the construction of additional satellites. New channels we 57 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued add to our service using only that technology may allow us to further reduce conversion costs and create additional revenue opportunities. We have also implemented MPEG 4 technology in all satellite receivers for new customers who subscribe to our HD programming packages. This technology should result in further bandwidth efficiencies over time. We have not yet determined the extent to which we will convert the EchoStar DBS System to these new technologies, or the period of time over which the conversions will occur. Since EchoStar X commenced commercial operation during the second quarter of 2006 and provided that other planned satellites are successfully deployed, this increased satellite capacity and our 8PSK transition will afford us greater flexibility in delaying and reducing the costs otherwise required to convert our subscriber base to MPEG 4. While we may be able to generate increased revenue from such conversions, the deployment of equipment including new technologies will increase the cost of our consumer equipment, at least in the short term. Our expensed and capitalized subscriber acquisition and retention costs will increase to the extent we subsidize those costs for new and existing subscribers. These increases may be mitigated to the extent we successfully redeploy existing receivers and implement other equipment cost reduction strategies. In an effort to reduce subscriber turnover, we offer existing subscribers a variety of options for upgraded and add on equipment. We generally lease receivers and subsidize installation of EchoStar receiver systems under these subscriber retention programs. As discussed above, we will have to upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes. As a consequence, our retention costs, which are included in Subscriber related expenses, and our capital expenditures related to our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, will increase, at least in the short term, to the extent we subsidize the costs of those upgrades and replacements. Our capital expenditures related to subscriber retention programs could also increase in the future to the extent we increase penetration of our equipment lease program for existing subscribers, if we introduce other more aggressive promotions, if we offer existing subscribers more aggressive promotions for HD receivers or EchoStar receivers with other enhanced technologies, or for other reasons. Cash necessary to fund retention programs and total subscriber acquisition costs are expected to be satisfied from existing cash and marketable investment securities balances and cash generated from operations to the extent available. We may, however, decide to raise additional capital in the future to meet these requirements. If we decided to raise capital today, a variety of debt and equity funding sources would likely be available to us. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed in the future. Obligations and Future Capital Requirements Contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. In general, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities. Future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 6,525,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,525,000 $ 3,000,000 Satellite related obligations 2,758,699 658,047 711,128 268,930 1,120,594 Capital lease obligations 404,942 34,701 81,378 99,883 188,980 Operating lease obligations 91,849 32,462 39,637 16,187 3,563 Purchase obligations 1,258,289 934,780 294,219 29,290 Mortgages and other notes payable 37,379 3,768 5,675 5,710 22,226 Total $ 11,076,158 $ 2,663,758 $ 2,132,037 $ 1,920,000 $ 4,360,363 Interest on Long Term Debt We have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for details), as follows: 58 Table of Contents Item 7.

Semi annual cash interest payments related to our 7% Senior Notes due 2013 will commence on April 1, 2007. We also have periodic cash interest requirements for our outstanding capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable. Future cash interest requirements for all of our outstanding long term debt are summarized as follows: Payments due by period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter (In thousands) Long term debt (1) $ 2,279,735 $ 343,608 $ 632,895 $ 553,408 $ 749,824 Capital lease obligations, mortgages and other notes payable 177,196 36,321 62,388 46,093 32,394 Total $ 2,456,931 $ 379,929 $ 695,283 $ 599,501 $ 782,218 (1) This does not include interest of $14.4 million on the 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008 which were redeemed on February 15, 2007 (see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Satellite Related Obligations Satellites under Construction. We have entered into contracts to construct new satellites which are contractually scheduled to be completed within the next three years, see Item 1 Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations except where noted below. During 2004, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XI which is expected to be completed in 2007. However, the launch could be delayed until the second half of 2008 as a result of problems currently being experienced by the launch provider, Sea Launch. During 2004 and 2005, we entered into contracts for the construction of four additional SSL Ka and or Ku extended band satellites which are expected to be completed during 2008 and 2009. CMBStar, an S band satellite, is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. Provided required regulatory approvals are obtained and contractual conditions are satisfied, the transponder capacity of that satellite will be leased to an affiliate of a Chinese regulatory entity. During January 2007, we entered into a contract for the construction of EchoStar XIV which is expected to be completed during 2009. Future commitments related to this satellite are not included in the table above. Leased Satellites. In addition to our lease of the AMC 15 and AMC 16 satellites discussed below under Capital Lease Obligations, we have also entered satellite service agreements to lease capacity on other satellites, see Item 1 59 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Business Our Satellites. Future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under Satellite related obligations. We are currently leasing all of the capacity on an existing in orbit FSS satellite, AMC 2, at the 85 degree orbital location. Our lease of this satellite is expected to continue through 2007 and has been accounted for as an operating lease. An SES Americom DBS satellite, AMC 14, which is currently expected to launch during late 2007 and commence commercial operation at an orbital location to be determined at a future date. The initial ten year lease for all of the capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. A Telesat FSS satellite, Anik F3, which is currently expected to launch during the second quarter of 2007. We are required to make monthly payments for the 15 year period following commencement of commercial operation. We will account for the Telesat Anik F3 satellite agreement as a capital lease. A Canadian DBS satellite, Ciel 2, which is currently expected to launch during 2009 and commence commercial operation at the 129 degree orbital location. Our initial ten year term lease for at least 50% capacity on the satellite will be accounted for as a capital lease. In certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed. These amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction, launch or lease of additional satellites. Further, as of December 31, 2006, we had not procured launches for six of the above satellites. Our obligations will increase as we procure launches for these satellites. Capital Lease Obligations AMC 15. We make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 15, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during January 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. AMC 16. We also make monthly payments to SES Americom to lease all of the capacity on AMC 16, an FSS satellite, which commenced commercial operation during February 2005. The ten year satellite service agreement is renewable by us on a year to year basis following the initial term, and provides us with certain rights to replacement satellites. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases (SFAS 13), we have accounted for the satellite component of these agreements as a capital lease (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The commitment related to the present value of the net future minimum lease payments for the satellite component of the agreement is included under Capital Lease Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to future minimum payments designated for the lease of the orbital slots and other executory costs is included under Satellite Related Obligations in the table above. The commitment related to the amount representing interest is included under Interest on Long Term Debt in the table above. Purchase Obligations Our 2007 purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for EchoStar receiver systems and related equipment, and for products and services related to the operation of our DISH Network. Our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content. Our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to, among other things, managements control of inventory levels, and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances, and our future working capital requirements. 60 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Programming Contracts In the normal course of business, we have entered into numerous contracts to purchase programming content where our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the content. These programming commitments are not included in the table above. The terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases. Our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base. Programming expenses are included in Subscriber related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Satellite insurance. We currently have no commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we own. We do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomic relative to the risk of satellite failure. We believe we generally have in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to recover, in a relatively short time frame, transmission of most of our critical programming in the event one of our in orbit satellites fails. We could not, however, recover certain local markets, international and other niche programming. Further, programming continuity cannot be assured in the event of multiple satellite losses. Future capital requirements. In addition to our DBS business plan, we are exploring business plans for FSS extended Ku band and FSS Ka band satellite systems, including licenses to operate at the 97, 109, 113 and 121 degree orbital locations. As a result of expected penetration of our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we anticipate an increase in capitalized subscriber equipment during 2007. We expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be higher than 2006 capital expenditures of $1.396 billion. From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that would complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video, data and voice services. Future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital. Also, as discussed previously, our Board of Directors approved extending the plan to repurchase our Class A common stock, which could require that we raise additional capital. The maximum dollar value of shares that may still be purchased under the plan is $625.8 million. There can be no assurance that we could raise all required capital or that required capital would be available on acceptable terms. Security Ratings Our current credit ratings are Ba3 and BB on our long term senior notes, and B2 and B with respect to our publicly traded convertible subordinated notes, as rated by Moodys Investor Service and Standard and Poors Rating Service, respectively. Debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agencys opinion of the ability of issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due. With respect to Moodys, the Ba3 rating for our senior debt indicates that the obligations are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. For SP, the BB rating indicates the issuer is less vulnerable to nonpayment of interest and principal obligations than other speculative issues. However, the issuer faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Effective February 15, 2007, we redeemed all of our outstanding 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2008. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future 61 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.

The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments.

Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary.

In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation, judgment and complexity. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capitalized satellite receivers. Since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs, we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale. Such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which is based on, among other things, managements judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence. Because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate, the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on, among other things, historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions. Accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities. We hold debt and equity interests in companies, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment. Future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. Valuation of investments in non marketable investment securities. We calculate the fair value of our interest in non marketable investment securities either at consideration given, or for non cash acquisitions, based on the results of valuation analyses utilizing a discounted cash flow or DCF model. The DCF methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required. Valuation of long lived assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. We evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs. Changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period. Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually, and also when events and circumstances warrant. We use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment, if any, of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Smart card replacement. We use microchips embedded in credit card sized access cards, called smart cards, or in security chips in our EchoStar receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content. Our signal encryption has been compromised by theft of service and could be further compromised in the future. We continue to respond to compromises of our encryption system with security measures intended to make signal theft of our programming more difficult. During 2005, we completed the replacement of our smart cards. While the smart card replacement did not fully secure our system, we continue to implement software patches and other security measures to help protect our service. There can be no assurance that our security measures will be effective in reducing theft of our programming signals. As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any accrual for future smart card replacement. At the time, if ever, that we determine existing smart cards will be replaced again, we would accrue a liability for the estimated cost to replace those cards in receivers sold to and owned by subscribers. That cost estimate would be based on the number of cards expected to be replaced, taking into account a number of variables, including the cost of the cards and historical subscriber churn trends. Changes in, among other things, the timing of the replacement plan could result in increases or decreases in the smart card replacement reserve. With respect to receivers we lease, we would record the expenses of replacement as incurred. 62 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the amount of required allowances for the potential non collectibility of accounts receivable based upon past collection experience and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future collections and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual collections. Inventory reserve. Management estimates the amount of reserve required for potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience, the introduction of new technology and consideration of other relevant factors. However, past experience may not be indicative of future reserve requirements and therefore additional charges could be incurred in the future to reflect differences between estimated and actual reserve requirements. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term); the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term (volatility), and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures), see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation. Income taxes. Our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow the guidelines set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109) regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required. Determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. In accordance with SFAS 109, we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence, including trends, and future expectations in each reporting period. Future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits, or reversals of valuation allowances, as reported in our results of operations. Contingent liabilities. A significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when, or if, an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual. Estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event, it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingency matter, a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, were adopted effective January 1, 2007. 63 Table of Contents Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Continued We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurement. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities Exchange Commission Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 also requires the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements to be considered when assessing the materiality misstatements in current year financial statements. If upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of the misstatements is determined to be material using the new guidance of SAB 108, companies are allowed to record the effects as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006. In accordance with the transition provisions of SAB 108, we recorded a $62.3 million cumulative increase, net of tax of $37.4 million, to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Historically, while our financial statements reflected payments to certain programming and other vendors for a full year, each 12 month period included several days or weeks from the prior calendar year. This discrepancy between our calendar and fiscal year for certain vendor accruals was immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements. However, the growth of our subscriber base over the past 10 years has increased this discrepancy resulting in a cumulative increase to opening accumulated deficit of $78.4 million for programming obligations and $21.3 million for other vendor obligations. We concluded that these adjustments are immaterial to prior years consolidated financial statements under our previous method of assessing materiality, and therefore elected, as permitted under the transition provisions of SAB 108, to reflect the effect of these adjustments in liabilities as of January 1, 2006, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2006. Seasonality Our revenues vary throughout the year. As is typical in the subscription television service industry, the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of such advertising and promotion is realized in future periods. Inflation Inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years. We believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures. We do not have any material backlog of our products. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risks Associated With Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2006, our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had a fair value of $3.206 billion. Of that amount, a total of $2.884 billion was invested in: (a) cash; (b) debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies; (c) commercial paper and notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; and (d) instruments with similar risk characteristics to the commercial paper described above. The primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to, 64 Table of Contents among other things, fund operations, make strategic investments and expand the business. Consequently, the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business. Our restricted and unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable investment securities had an average annual return for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 5.4%. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $12.6 million in annual interest income. The value of certain of the investments in this portfolio can be impacted by, among other things, the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets generally, as well as the risks related to the performance of the companies whose commercial paper and other instruments we hold. However, the high quality of these investments (as assessed by independent rating agencies), reduces these risks. The value of these investments can also be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, all of the $2.884 billion was invested in fixed or variable rate instruments or money market type accounts. While an increase in interest rates would ordinarily adversely impact the fair value of fixed and variable rate investments, we normally hold these investments to maturity. Consequently, neither interest rate fluctuations nor other market risks typically result in significant realized gains or losses to this portfolio. A decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio, since funds would be re invested at lower rates as the instruments mature. Included in our marketable investment securities portfolio balance is debt and equity of public companies we hold for strategic and financial purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of $321.2 million. We may make additional strategic and financial investments in debt and other equity securities in the future. The fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally, as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in, risks associated with specific industries, and other factors. These investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses. A hypothetical 10.0% adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in approximately a $32.1 million decrease in the fair value of that portfolio. The fair value of our strategic debt investments are currently not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations due to the nature of these investments. We currently classify all marketable investment securities as available for sale. We adjust the carrying value of our available for sale securities to fair value and report the related temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit), net of related deferred income tax. Declines in the fair value of a marketable investment security which are estimated to be other than temporary are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), thus establishing a new cost basis for such investment. We evaluate our marketable investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of these securities are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, the fair value of our marketable investment securities compared to the carrying amount, the historical volatility of the price of each security and any market and company specific factors related to each security. Generally, absent specific factors to the contrary, declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period of less than six months are considered to be temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments for a continuous period of six to nine months are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether any company or market specific factors exist which would indicate that such declines are other than temporary. Declines in the fair value of investments below cost basis for a continuous period greater than nine months are considered other than temporary and are recorded as charges to earnings, absent specific factors to the contrary. As of December 31, 2006, we had unrealized gains net of related tax effect of $41.8 million as a part of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Total stockholders equity (deficit). During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any charge to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our marketable investment securities. In addition, during 2006, we recognized realized and unrealized net gains on marketable investment securities and conversion of bond instruments into common stock of $88.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our strategic investments have experienced and continue to experience volatility. If the fair value of our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio does not remain above cost basis or if we become aware of any market or company specific factors that indicate that the carrying value of certain of our securities is impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings in future periods equal to the amount of the decline in fair value. 65 Table of Contents We also have several strategic investments in certain non marketable equity securities which are included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we account for our unconsolidated equity investments under either the equity method or cost method of accounting. Because these equity securities are not publicly traded, it is not practical to regularly estimate the fair value of the investments; however, these investments are subject to an evaluation for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This quarterly evaluation consists of reviewing, among other things, company business plans and current financial statements, if available, for factors that may indicate an impairment of our investment. Such factors may include, but are not limited to, cash flow concerns, material litigation, violations of debt covenants and changes in business strategy. The fair value of these equity investments is not estimated unless there are identified changes in circumstances that may indicate an impairment exists and these changes are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. As of December 31, 2006, we had $188.6 million aggregate carrying amount of non marketable and unconsolidated strategic equity investments, of which $97.8 million is accounted for under the cost method. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $18.0 million of impairment charges with respect to these investments. We also have a strategic investment in non public preferred stock, public common stock and convertible debt of a foreign public company which is included in Other noncurrent assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt is convertible into the issuers publicly traded common shares. We account for the convertible debt at fair value with changes in fair value reported each period as unrealized gains or losses in Other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We estimate the fair value of the convertible debt using certain assumptions and judgments in applying a discounted cash flow analysis and the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible debt was approximately $22.5 million based on the trading price of the issuers shares on that date. During the second quarter of 2006, we converted a portion of the convertible debt to public common shares and determined that we have the ability to significantly influence the operating decisions of the issuer. Consequently, we account for the common share component of our investment under the equity method of accounting. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a pre tax unrealized loss of approximately $14.9 million for the change in the fair value of the convertible debt. As of December 31, 2006, we have $59.1 million recorded as part of the total equity investment in Other non current assets, net for the amount by which the carrying value of our investment in the issuers common stock exceeds the value of our portion of the underlying balance sheet equity of the investee. As a result of our change from cost to equity method accounting, we evaluate the common share component on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the fair value of this security are other than temporary. This quarterly evaluation is similar to that used for marketable securities, as discussed above. Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded is dependent on the success of their business and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans. Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.562 billion of fixed rate debt, mortgages and other notes payable that we estimated the fair value to be approximately $6.499 billion using quoted market prices where available. In completing our analysis for our private debt, we evaluate market conditions, related securities, various public and private offerings, and other publicly available information. In performing this analysis, we make various assumptions regarding credit spreads, volatility, and the impact of these factors on the value of the notes. The fair value of our fixed rate debt and mortgages is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A hypothetical 10.0% decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $186.8 million. To the extent interest rates increase, our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10.0% increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $40.5 million. In general, we do not use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes, but we may do so in the future.
