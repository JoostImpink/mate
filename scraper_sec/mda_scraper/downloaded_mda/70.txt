ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the narrative description of our business in Item 1 of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10 K and our Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying Notes and other information listed in the accompanying Financial Table of Contents. Overview We develop, manufacture and market a broad line of innovative, technologically enhanced PVC free and latex free urinary continence and urine drainage care products for patients who generally use such products at home. A small percentage of our urological products also are used in the acute care market, which generally includes hospitals and extended care treatment facilities. Through our recently acquired subsidiary, Laprolan B.V., we also sell certain ostomy and wound and scar care products and other brands of urological products into the European marketplace. The primary purchasers of our products are distributors, individual hospitals and healthcare institutions, and extended care facilities. We sell our products directly and through private label partners, both in the domestic market and internationally. International sales accounted for approximately 63% and 65% of total sales in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The urological products we manufacture include our silicone male external catheters (MECs), our standard and advanced lines of silicone and anti infection intermittent catheters and our FemSoft Insert. Through our fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, we also manufactured standard and advanced lines of silicone and anti infection Foley catheters for the acute care market. In November 2012, we announced our decision to cease manufacturing and marketing Foley catheters, and will focus on our core product lines of MECs and intermittent catheters. Net sales of Foley catheters were approximately $4.0 million for fiscal 2012, representing approximately 6% of our total net sales. Costs and expenses associated with manufacturing and marketing Foley catheters are extensive, and this product line had not yet reached a point of positive earnings contribution. As such, we estimate our decision to exit this business will significantly enhance our profitability. We will continue to fulfill orders for Foley catheters for up to 90 days from announcement, during which time we expect to deplete the majority of our remaining Foley inventory. We will continue to own the intellectual property associated with our Foley catheters in anticipation of deriving additional value from those assets in the future. Direct sales include all our Rochester Medical branded sales, Script Easy sales and all of our other sales at Laprolan. We market our products under our Rochester Medical brand through a direct sales force in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and through independent distributors in other international markets. As part of our three year strategic business plan through fiscal 2013, we increased the level of investment in our sales and marketing programs in fiscal 2011 to support our direct sales growth in the U.S. and Europe through the addition of several members to our sales team. As of September 30, 2012, our U.S. direct sales force consisted of 34 members, which has been reduced to 21 members following our decision to exit the Foley catheter business. Internationally, we sell our Rochester Medical branded products in the United Kingdom through a direct sales force of 29 members, and in the Netherlands through a direct sales force of twelve members as of September 30, 2012, respectively. In the U.K., we also sell our Rochester Medical brand products and other companies products direct to the patient through the Script Easy program. U.K. residents can call a toll free number and order products for direct home delivery upon verification of a prescription from a doctor. In fiscal 2012, the Script Easy program contributed $12.8 million of net sales compared to $10.4 million in fiscal 2011, and is the vehicle where new intermittent catheter patients and FemSoft patients in the U.K. are driven. In the Netherlands, we have the exclusive rights to market a range of continence care, ostomy and wound and scar care products of other medical device companies. Laprolan has been an importer and distributor of medical products since 1986, and markets its products and services exclusively to healthcare institutions, physicians and specialty nurses. On April 7, 2011, we completed the acquisition of the outstanding capital stock of Laprolan B.V., a 26 Table of Contents corporation organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Fornix BioSciences N.V., pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement. We paid a cash purchase price at closing of &euro;10,474,974 (US$15,057,775, of which $60,217 was paid for the cash balance of Laprolan B. on January 1, 2011 and $119,433 was interest paid to Fornix from January 1, 2011 until closing). As provided in the Share Purchase Agreement, the transaction had a retroactive effective date of January 1, 2011, and the operating results of Laprolan B. are for our account from and after January 1, 2011. We have applied purchase accounting as of that date and have included the results of Laprolan B. in our financial statements beginning with the second quarter of our fiscal 2011. A significant portion of our net sales to date have depended on our ability to provide products that meet the requirements of medical product companies that resell or distribute our products, and on the sales and marketing efforts of such entities. Private label sales arrangements with these entities are likely to continue to be a significant, but declining, percentage of our revenues in the future, while we continue to establish our own market presence under the Rochester Medical brand name. Private label sales represented 20% of total sales in fiscal 2012, compared to 22% of total sales in fiscal 2011. Increasing our percentage of direct sales versus private label sales over time will have a positive impact on our gross margin. Net sales for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 were $61.7 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 16%, from $53.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net sales resulted from an 18% increase in direct sales for the fiscal year, while private label sales increased 6% for the fiscal year. The increase in direct sales resulted from an increase in sales to the home care market in the United States and internationally, as well as an increase in sales to the acute care market in the U.S., offset by a decrease in acute care sales internationally. Home care direct sales accounted for 89% of total direct sales for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. Our five largest customers in fiscal 2012 represented approximately 31% of our total net sales. Because our larger customers typically purchase products in relatively large quantities at a time, our financial performance can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon the timing of their purchases. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales. In September 2009, the FemSoft Insert was approved for inclusion in Part IX of the UK Drug Tariff as a prescription product that is reimbursable under the National Healthcare System, commencing in 2010. In November 2009, the CMS issued a specific Medicare reimbursement code which covers our FemSoft Insert. In January 2011, the CMS notified us of their decision regarding the Medicare reimbursement fee to be used for the FemSoft Insert in response to our request that the pricing data used to establish the fee schedule be revised. The current Medicare fee schedule amount is based on price data that is closest to a 1986/1987 base period and is significantly lower than the current retail price for the FemSoft Insert. We continue to believe that the reimbursement fee is unreasonably low, and we intend to continue to pursue a dialog with the CMS in an effort to change the reimbursement rate. We continue to believe the availability of National Healthcare System and Medicare reimbursement will help this unique device become an economically accessible and often preferred solution for incontinent women in the United Kingdom and in the United States. While it is still too early to know the full potential of this product in the marketplace, management believes it can become an integral part of our product offering. Our manufacturing facilities, which we own, are located in Stewartville, Minnesota, and have been designed to accommodate the specialized requirements for the manufacture of medical devices, including FDA requirements for Quality System Regulation. A substantial portion of the expenses associated with our manufacturing facilities are fixed in nature (i.e. depreciation) and will reduce our operating margin until such time as we are able to increase utilization of our capacity through increased sales of our products. As of September 30, 2012, we had $13.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $6.8 million invested in marketable securities. The marketable securities primarily consist of $6.3 million invested in U.S. treasury bills and $.5 million invested in CDs. Our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and the value 27 Table of Contents thereof could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates. Our investment choices, however, are conservative and are intended to reduce the risk of loss or any material impact on our financial condition. Our net income for fiscal 2012 was $2,050,000, or $.17 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $(1,315,000), or $(.11) per diluted share, in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily resulted from increased sales as well as reduced operating expenses incurred in 2012. The objective of our three year strategic plan that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2011 was to double our annual overall sales during the three fiscal years of the plan, while also producing a significant increase in net income in the third fiscal year. As part of that plan, we increased the level of investment in our sales and marketing programs to support our direct sales growth in the U.S. and Europe through the addition of several members to our sales team, with the increased investment expected to be funded primarily through cash generated from operations. We recently updated our three year strategic plan, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of our Foley catheter line and, to a lesser extent, a more conservative assumption regarding international sales given the broader economic challenges in Europe, although we still expect significant growth in sales and improved net income as a result of our strategic plan and the higher level of profitability we expect to achieve following our exit of the Foley catheter business. Management believes that the ongoing strategic effort to grow our Rochester Medical direct sales through increased investment in sales and marketing programs is providing positive results. Some quarter to quarter fluctuation in sales growth remains likely, however, through the term of the plan, primarily due to the timing of large private label orders, but we expect quarterly fluctuations in sales to diminish as private label sales represent a smaller percentage of total sales. We will also continue to look for other strategic opportunities to increase our product line and distribution capabilities. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on going basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Inventories Inventories, consisting of material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market. Our policy is to establish an excess and obsolete reserve for our products in excess of the expected demand for such products. At September 30, 2012, this reserve was $148,000 compared to $166,000 at September 30, 2011. If actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us, additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required. These valuation adjustments would be included in cost of goods sold. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is calculated by a combination of specific account identification as well as percentages of past due balances. At September 30, 2012, this allowance was $86,000 28 Table of Contents compared to $45,000 at September 30, 2011. If actual future collections or customer liquidity conditions differ from those projected by us, additional receivables valuation adjustments may be required. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. We require prepayments by certain foreign customers. Receivables generally are due within 30 to 60 days. Revenue Recognition We have standard contract terms with all non Group Purchase Organization customers of FOB shipping point; as such, sales are recognized upon shipment. GPO customers have terms of FOB destination per the agreement and thus sales are recognized upon delivery of goods to the customer. Revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. For all GPO customer orders shipped within the last five working days of a quarter, we monitor the shipping tracking number for such shipments to verify receipt by the customer. If we are able to verify receipt by the customer by the end of the month, the sale is recognized in that month. Payment terms for all customers range from prepayment to 60 days. Customers cannot return unsold products unless we have authorized such return for warranty claims. We warrant that the products we sell to our customers will conform to the description and specifications furnished by us, and that the products will be free from defects in material and workmanship. In the event of a warranty claim, the customer is responsible for shipping the product(s) back to us, freight prepaid. If the failure of the product is due to a breach of warranty, we may repair or replace the defective product(s) at our option and return the repaired or replaced product(s) to the customer, freight prepaid. This is the limit of our warranty liability, and this warranty is made in lieu of all other written or unwritten express or implied warranties. Historically, due to the nature of use of our products and low replacement cost, our warranty exposure has been immaterial. Other than our limited warranty obligation, we do not have post shipment obligations to, or acceptance provisions with, our customers, including our distributors. Income Taxes The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the United States, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, based on estimates and assumptions. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. At September 30, 2012, we recorded a valuation allowance of $216,000 of which $42,000 is related to Minnesota R&D credit and $174,000 pertains to U.S. federal capital loss carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized in future years. We have not recorded a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirements for a valuation allowance. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangibles We follow Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. When we acquire a company, the purchase price is allocated, as applicable, between identifiable trademarks, other intangible assets, tangible assets, and goodwill as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to the trademarks and other intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to trademarks and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each trademark or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business. We test annually for impairment of the asset, currently on June 1st of each fiscal year for the goodwill 29 Table of Contents associated with our 2006 U.K. acquisition and for the goodwill related to our 2011 Netherlands acquisition. We have determined the reporting unit continues to be at the enterprise level. We apply a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis and on an interim basis if certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred by comparing the fair value of discounted cash flows for each reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill was approximately $9.1 million as of September 30, 2012 and 2011. Finite life intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, patents and trademarks and are amortized using the straight line method, as appropriate, over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years. All of our intangible assets are finite lived. We review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $9.4 million and $10.3 million as of September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Long Lived Assets We follow ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. As such, we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable. Long lived assets are considered not recoverable when the carrying amount of a long lived asset (asset group) exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (asset group). If it is determined that a long lived asset (asset group) is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset (asset group) over the long lived assets (asset groups) fair value. Fair value is the amount at which the long lived asset (asset group) could be bought or sold in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Stock Based Compensation Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Total stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 was approximately $600,000 after tax ($1.0 million pre tax). See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation programs. The estimated fair value of restricted shares is determined by the market price at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period of four years. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options as of the grant date. The fair value of stock options under the Black Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk free interest rate, volatility of our stock price and expected dividends. We use the intrinsic value method to estimate the value of restricted stock awards. We analyze historical employee stock option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption. We believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option. We also stratify our employee population based upon distinctive exercise behavior patterns. The risk free interest rate we use is based on the yield, on the grant date, of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period equals or approximates the options expected term. We calculate the expected volatility based solely on historical volatility which continues to be the most appropriate measure for us. The dividend yield rate used is zero as we have not nor expect to pay dividends. The amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. We estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 30 Table of Contents If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the expense associated with new awards in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period related to historical awards and could materially affect our net income and diluted net income per share of a future period. There were no modifications to any of our plans in 2012. There is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based awards on the grant dates as determined using the Black Scholes model may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise or forfeiture of those stock based awards in the future. Some employee stock options may expire without value, or only realize minimal intrinsic value, as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and recognized in our financial statements. Alternatively, some employee stock options may realize significantly more value than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and recognized in our financial statements.

Private label sales include our products packaged and sold by other manufacturers. Acute care refers to hospital sales. Home care refers to non hospital sales. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 Net Sales. Net sales increased 16% to $61.7 million in fiscal 2012 from $53.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from an increase in direct sales in the Europe and Middle East ("EME") region and the U.S., an increase in private label sales in the U.S., offset by a slight decrease in EME private label sales. The increase in direct sales resulted from an increase in home care sales in both the U.S. and EME regions as well as modest increases in home care sales in the rest of the world ("ROW") and acute care sales in the U.S., offset by a slight decrease in acute care sales in the ROW and EME. U.S. direct sales increased by 32% over last fiscal year. Our EME direct sales increased 14% compared to last year led by a strong increase in the U.K. and twelve months of revenue from Laprolan versus nine months of revenue the prior year. Management believes these results demonstrate the favorable impact of our strategic decision to increase investments in direct sales and marketing programs for our Rochester Medical branded products, particularly for our advanced intermittent catheters, which we believe will continue to drive growth in branded sales. Total net sales for the fiscal year were negatively affected by $975,000 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar versus the pound sterling and the euro, thereby affecting sales given the significant volume of our Rochester Medical branded product sales in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Direct sales in the ROW were flat compared to the same period last year. Private label sales were up 32 Table of Contents $701,000 from last year. Private label sales accounted for approximately 20% of total sales in fiscal 2012 compared to 22% in the prior fiscal year. We expect private label sales as a percentage of total sales to decline over time as we focus more on growing our direct sales. Gross Margin. Our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 50% in fiscal 2012, unchanged from fiscal 2011. Increased sales and higher mix of lower margin products, particularly new advanced intermittent catheters and Foley catheters, offset manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales of higher margin products, particularly MECs. Management expects the sale of our new advanced intermittent catheters will continue to have a negative impact on margin until we are producing them at higher levels needed to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. However, the sale of Laprolan products and our direct sales in both the U.S. and EME should continue to have a positive impact on margin as we continue to focus on direct sales. Our exit from the Foley catheter business should also have a positive impact on gross margin. Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense primarily includes costs associated with base salary paid to sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, and travel and advertising expense. Marketing and selling expense decreased 3% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, with marketing and selling expense of approximately $18.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $18.8 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease in marketing and selling expense is primarily due to $83,000 of decreased travel expenses, $498,000 of decreased advertising and project costs primarily for acute care partially offset by increases for home care and new intermittent catheter product launches, $34,000 of decreased freight costs and a $180,000 decrease in consulting fees, partially offset by $225,000 of increased compensation expenses for our home care sales and marketing team. Marketing and selling expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012 was 30% compared to 35% for fiscal 2011. Research and Development. Research and development expense primarily includes internal labor costs, materials used to develop new products, as well as expense associated with third party vendors performing validation and investigative research regarding our products and development activities. Research and development expense increased to $1.2 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.0 million in fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily related to the addition of our Vice President, Development & Research. Research and development expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was 2% and 2%, respectively. General and Administrative. General and administrative expense primarily includes payroll expense related to our management and accounting, information technology and human resources staff, as well as fees and expenses of outside legal counsel, accounting advisors and auditors. General and administrative expense decreased to $8.2 million in 2012 from $8.5 million in fiscal 2011. The changes in general and administrative expense primarily related to a decrease of the one time costs associated with the acquisition of Laprolan incurred in fiscal 2011, decreases of $34,000 in compensation expenses and $58,000 in travel, and increases of $103,000 in depreciation. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was 13% and 16%, respectively. Interest Income. Interest income decreased 69% to $43,000 in fiscal 2012 from $140,000 in the prior fiscal year. The decrease reflects overall lower interest rates on investments and lower cash available for investment following the payoff of our line of credit balance. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased 68% to $90,000 in fiscal 2012 from $277,000 in fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest expense reflects lower amounts of debt as a result of paying off the outstanding balance on our line of credit originally incurred to finance our acquisition of Laprolan. Income Taxes. During the current fiscal year we utilized federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $456,000 and have approximately $1.6 million remaining. We have U.K. NOL carry forwards as of September 30, 2012 of approximately 51,000 pounds sterling (approximately $82,000). For fiscal 2012, we have a valuation allowance of $216,000 related to Minnesota R&D credit and U.S. federal capital loss carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized in future years. We have not 33 Table of Contents recorded a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized. For fiscal 2012, we had an effective tax rate of approximately 34% resulting primarily from foreign operations, incentive stock options and other permanent differences. In future periods of taxable earnings, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 30 34%. Net Income (Loss). For fiscal 2012, we reported a net income of $2,050,000 compared to a net loss of $(1,315,000) in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income was primarily driven by increased sales resulting from our strategic investment in net sales and marketing programs and our focus on direct sales in home care markets as we executed on our three year strategic business plan. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 Net Sales. Net sales increased 28% to $53.4 million in fiscal 2011 from $41.5 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from an increase in direct sales in the Europe and Middle East ("EME") region and the U.S. for the fiscal year, offset by a slight decrease in private label sales. The increase in direct sales resulted from an increase in home care sales in both the U.S. and EME regions as well as modest increases in acute care sales in the U.S., EME and the rest of the world ("ROW"), offset by a slight decrease in home care sales in the ROW. U.S. direct sales increased by 19% over last fiscal year. Our EME direct sales increased 50% compared to last year led by a strong increase in both the U.K. and the Netherlands in acute care sales of 117% and home care sales of 46%. Private label sales were down slightly in both the U.S. and EME regions. Management believes these results demonstrate the favorable impact of our strategic decision to increase investments in direct sales and marketing programs for our Rochester Medical branded products. Additionally, beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2011, direct sales include the sales of Laprolan B.V., our recently acquired subsidiary in the Netherlands. Total sales were partially strengthened $491,000 as a result of the change in foreign currency exchange rates in the United Kingdom as the U.S. dollar was somewhat weaker versus the pound sterling, thereby affecting sales positively given the significant volume of our Rochester Medical branded product sales in the United Kingdom. Direct sales in the ROW increased slightly compared to the same period last year including an increase in acute care sales of $289,000 offset by a decrease in home care sales of $228,000. Private label sales were down $186,000 from last year. Private label sales accounted for approximately 22% of total sales in fiscal 2011 compared to 28% in the prior fiscal year. Gross Margin. Our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 50% in fiscal 2011, compared to 48% in fiscal 2010. Increased sales of lower margin products, particularly new advanced intermittent catheters and Foley catheters, offset manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales of higher margin products, particularly male external catheters. Marketing and Selling. As part of our three year strategic business plan through fiscal 2013, we continued to increase the investment in our sales and marketing programs, primarily through cash generated from current operations and use of available funds, to support direct sales growth in the U.S. and Europe. Marketing and selling expense primarily includes costs associated with base salary paid to sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, and travel and advertising expense. Marketing and selling expense increased 54% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, with marketing and selling expense of approximately $18.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $12.2 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in marketing and selling expense is primarily related to $5,258,000 of compensation expenses, $1,029,000 of increased travel expenses, $441,000 of increased advertising and project costs mostly focused on our FemSoft Insert and our new advanced intermittent and Foley catheters, $327,000 in freight and $58,000 increase in consulting fees. Marketing and selling expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011 was 35% compared to 29% for fiscal 2010. Research and Development. Research and development expense primarily includes internal labor costs, materials used to develop new products, as well as expense associated with third party vendors performing validation and investigative research regarding our products and development activities. Research and development 34 Table of Contents expense decreased from the prior year to $1.0 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.2 million in fiscal year 2010. Research and development expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was 2% and 3%, respectively. General and Administrative. General and administrative expense primarily includes payroll expense related to our management and accounting, information technology and human resources staff, as well as fees and expenses of outside legal counsel, accounting advisors and auditors. General and administrative expense increased to $8.5 million in 2011 from $6.4 million in fiscal 2010. The changes in general and administrative expense primarily relate to one time costs associated with the acquisition of Laprolan, administrative expenses in Laprolan and increases of $160,000 in compensation expenses, $186,000 in depreciation, and $45,000 of travel expenses, offset by decreases of $56,000 in professional fees. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was 16% and 15%, respectively. Interest Income. Interest income decreased 41% to $140,000 in fiscal 2011 from $239,000 in the prior fiscal year. The decrease reflects overall lower interest rates on investments. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 56% to $277,000 in fiscal 2011 from $177,000 in fiscal 2010. The increase in interest expense reflects increased interest related to debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Laprolan. Income Taxes. During fiscal 2011 we generated U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) of approximately $3.8 million. We had U.K. NOL carry forwards as of September 30, 2011 of approximately 1.3 million pounds sterling (approximately $2.1 million). For fiscal 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance of $42,000 related to Minnesota R&D credit carryovers as we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be utilized in future years. We did not record a valuation allowance on any other net deferred tax assets because there is sufficient future projected income to sustain that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be able to be utilized. For fiscal 2011, we had an effective tax rate of approximately 32% resulting primarily from foreign operations, incentive stock options and a few adjustments having an effect on the tax rate. These discrete adjustments included retroactive changes in deferred taxes as a result of a change in tax rates and recording a valuation allowance in the current year for Minnesota R&D credit carryovers. The amount of these items in comparison to our net income for the current year results in a significant effect on our effective tax rate percentage. Net Income (Loss). For fiscal 2011, we reported a net loss of $(1,315,000) compared to a net loss of $(254,000) in fiscal 2010. The increase in net loss was primarily impacted by our increased investment in sales and marketing programs as contemplated by our three year strategic business plan and one time costs associated with the acquisition of Laprolan. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities, and have raised approximately $40.7 million in net proceeds since our inception. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $20.7 million at September 30, 2012, compared with $34.9 million at September 30, 2011. The decrease in cash primarily resulted from cash used for capital expenditures, stock repurchases and debt repayments, partially offset by cash provided by operations and from stock option exercises. As of September 30, 2012, we had $6.8 million invested in marketable securities. The marketable securities primarily consist of $6.3 million invested in U.S. treasury bills and $.5 million in CDs. Our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and the value thereof could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates. Our investment choices, however, are conservative and are intended to reduce the risk of loss or any material impact on our financial condition. 35 Table of Contents We generated a net $5.9 million of cash from operating activities during the year compared with $2.6 million for the same period last year, with the primary difference being positive net income and decreased levels of inventory offset by increased accounts receivable. Cash flow provided by operating activities in 2012 was comprised of net income of $2.0 million decreased by an increase in net working capital components of $.2 million and increased by net non cash charges of $4.0 million, including depreciation and amortization of $2.7 million and stock based compensation of $1.0 million. Significant working capital changes are as follows: a $2,260,000 increase in accounts receivable reflecting timing of cash collections over prior year and sales growth, a $1,426,000 decrease in inventory levels, a $650,000 decrease in deferred income taxes, a $52,000 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $278,000 increase in accounts payable reflecting timing of payments, and a $241,000 increase in income taxes payable. During fiscal 2012, our working capital position, excluding cash and marketable securities, increased by $18.3 million as a result of the pay off of short term borrowings used to fund the acquisition of Laprolan. Accounts receivable balances increased $2.2 million during the fiscal year primarily due to growth in sales in the fourth quarter. Inventories as of September 30, 2012 decreased $1.4 million over fiscal 2011. Changes in other asset and liability balances related to timing differences. Investing activities, primarily the sale of marketable securities offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment, provided net cash of $17.9 million in fiscal 2012. Financing activities, primarily payments on short term debt and share repurchases, used net cash of $18.7 million in fiscal 2012. In June 2006, in conjunction with the asset purchase agreement with Coloplast, we entered into an unsecured loan note deed with Coloplast with an outstanding principal amount of $5,340,000. The promissory note was non interest bearing, payable and due in five equal installments of $1,068,000 payable annually on June 2. We discounted the note at 6.90%. The final payment of $1,068,000 was made in May 2011. In December 2010, we entered into a credit facility with RBC Wealth Management. The credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit of up to $25,000,000 with interest accruing monthly at a variable rate currently at 1.375%. In conjunction with the closing of the Laprolan acquisition, on April 7, 2011, we drew down $15,057,775 from the line of credit. In January 2012, we used a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and paid off our entire outstanding balance on our line of credit. The borrowings under this credit facility are limited to the value of eligible assets held with RBC Wealth Management. The credit facility now consists of a revolving line of credit of up to $5,000,000 with interest accruing monthly at a variable rate of 1.375% as of September 30, 2012. As of September 30, 2012, we had no outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit. We currently believe that our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs, method and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities; the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products; changes in, termination of, and the success of, existing and new distribution arrangements; the cost of maintaining, enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights; competing technological and market developments; developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters; the cost and progress of our research and development efforts; opportunities for growth through acquisition, joint venture or other business combinations, if any; and other factors. Our ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on 36 Table of Contents our operating and financial performance and is also subject to prevailing economic and financial conditions and to business and other factors beyond our control. Recently, global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions, a general tightening of credit, and an unprecedented level of market intervention from the United States and other governments. These events have adversely affected the U.S. and world economy, and may adversely affect the availability and cost of financing. In the event that additional financing is needed, we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant restrictive covenants. Collaborative arrangements, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies, products or marketing territories. Failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that such financing, if required, will be available on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of September 30, 2012: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Contractual Obligations Unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48(1) $ 32,621 $ $ 32,621 $ $ Operating leases 1,458,190 654,504 803,686 Purchase obligations (general operating) 3,075,921 3,075,921 Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,566,732 $ 3,730,425 $ 836,307 $ $ (1)See Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8 Income Taxes." Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2012, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011 05, "Presentation of Comprehensive Income" which requires comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income. The amendment does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income. Additionally, in December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 12, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05" which indefinitely defers the requirement in ASU No. 2011 05 to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. During the deferral period, the existing requirements in U.S. GAAP for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed. These standards will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning October 1, 2012 with retrospective application required. As these standards impact presentation requirements only, the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position. 37 Table of Contents In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment" that is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. This ASU permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other." This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 (our fiscal 2013). This standards update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information Statements other than historical information contained herein constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology such as "believe," "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "predict," "intend," "designed," "estimate," "should" or "continue" or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Such forward looking statements involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following: the uncertainty of market acceptance of new product introductions; the uncertainty of successfully establishing our separate Rochester Medical brand identity and increasing our direct sales; the uncertainty of timing of revenues from private label sales (particularly with respect to international customers); the uncertainty of successfully growing our international operations; the risks associated with operating an international business, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; the uncertainty of gaining new strategic relationships; the uncertainty of securing Group Purchasing Organization contract participation; the uncertainty of gaining significant sales from secured GPO contracts; FDA and other regulatory review and response times; the impact of continued healthcare cost containment; new laws related to healthcare availability, healthcare reform, payment for healthcare products and services or the marketing and distribution of products, including legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid systems or other U.S. or international reimbursement systems; changes in the tax or environmental laws or standards affecting our business; current economic instability in the U.S. and international economies; and other risk factors listed from time to time in our SEC reports, including, without limitation, the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. 38 Table of Contents  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Our primary financial instrument market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates. Our cash is invested in bank deposits and money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds and euros. The carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value. Our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and the value thereof could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates. Our investment choices, however, are conservative in light of current economic conditions, and include primarily U.S. treasury bills to reduce the risk of loss or any material impact on our financial condition. Our revolving line of credit bears interest at a variable rate currently at 1.375%. As of September 30, 2012 we had no outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit. In future periods, we believe a greater portion of our revenues could be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, thereby increasing our exposure to exchange rate gains and losses on non United States currency transactions. Sales through our subsidiary, Rochester Medical, Ltd., are denominated in pound sterling, and fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, sales through our subsidiary, Laprolan B.V., are denominated in euros, and fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the euro could adversely affect our financial results. Otherwise, we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature. We do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currencies, or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In the future, if we believe an increase in our currency exposure merits further review, we may consider entering into transactions to mitigate that risk. 39  Table of Contents
