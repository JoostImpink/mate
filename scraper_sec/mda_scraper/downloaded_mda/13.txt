These forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate, believe, consider, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, objective, plan, predict, projection, seek, strategy, target, will or other words of similar meaning. Some of them are opinions formed based upon general observations, anecdotal evidence and industry experience, but that are not supported by specific investigation or analysis.These forward looking statements reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We wish to caution readers that certain important factors may have affected and could in the future affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ significantly from what is anticipated by our forward looking statements. The most important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: an extended slowdown in the real estate markets across the nation, including a slowdown in the market for single family homes or the multifamily rental market; increases in operating costs, including costs related to real estate taxes, construction materials, labor and insurance, and our inability to manage our cost structure, both in our Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily businesses; our inability to realize all of the anticipated synergy benefits from the CalAtlantic acquisition or to realize them in the anticipated timeline; our inability to successfully execute our strategies; changes in general economic and financial conditions that reduce demand for our products and services, lower our profit margins or reduce our access to credit; our inability to acquire land at anticipated prices; the possibility that we will incur nonrecurring costs that affect earnings in one or more reporting periods; decreased demand for our homes or Lennar Multifamily rental properties; the possibility that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have more negative than positive impact on us; the possibility that the benefit from our increasing use of technology will not justify its cost; increased competition for home sales from other sellers of new and resale homes; negative effects of increasing mortgage interest rates; our inability to reduce the ratio of our homebuilding debt to our total capital net of cash; a decline in the value of our land inventories and resulting write downs of the carrying value of our real estate assets; the failure of the participants in various joint ventures to honor their commitments; difficulty obtaining land use entitlements or construction financing; natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance does not provide adequate coverage; new laws or regulatory changes that adversely affect the profitability of our businesses; our inability to refinance our debt on terms that are acceptable to us; and changes in accounting conventions that adversely affect our reported earnings.

We undertake no obligation to revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in SEC filings or otherwise.Outlook At the end of our fiscal 2018, we believe the market has taken a natural pause as higher home prices and rapid interest rate increases have combined to create a mismatch between prices and homebuyer expectations. While we saw traffic moderate and sales slow toward the end of 2018, with inventories low, we believe this is a temporary adjustment as strong employment, wage growth, consumer confidence and general economic growth drive the consumer to the market. We still believe that the housing market is primarily driven by the deficit in housing production that has persisted for over a decade. As interest rates have started to ease at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, we have seen traffic pick up. Additionally, if the market continues to remain soft, we believe our production oriented focus should allow us to move quickly to realize reduced costs in an accelerated production pace. Alternatively, if the market returns to normalized levels, we believe we will have a superior position with more homes started and available to sell and the critically needed trade base to deliver them. In spite of softer market conditions towards the back end of the year, fiscal 2018 was another strong year for Lennar, enhanced by the successful integration of CalAtlantic. Revenues totaled $20.6 billion, representing a 63% increase from 2017. This increase was largely driven by our homebuilding business which saw a 55% increase in deliveries to 45,627 homes primarily as a result of the CalAtlantic acquisition. Gross margins and operating margins, excluding backlog and construction in process write up, were 21.8%, and 13.3%, respectively, which is an improvement in operating margins of 40 basis points from 2017. This improvement was driven by a reduction in S,G&A as a percentage of home sales revenue to 8.5%, which is an all time fiscal year low, from 9.2% in 2017. Our new orders increased to 45,826, up 51% compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a 22Table of Contentsresult of the CalAtlantic acquisition. In addition, we ended the year with a strong sales backlog of 15,616 homes or $6.6 billion, up 75% in homes and 85% in dollar value.Consistent with our focus to revert to our core homebuilding platform, we sold our Rialto investment and asset management platform for $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. While we continue to hold valuable investment assets of Rialto, we will no longer oversee nor be engaged in the active management of Rialto. Subsequent to fiscal year end, we also sold the majority of our retail title agency business and our wholly owned title insurance carrier. In addition, we sold our real estate brokerage business in the first quarter of 2019. In 2018, our Financial Services segment produced $187.4 million of pre tax earnings, compared to $155.5 million in 2017. The increase was largely due to an increase in the segments title and mortgage operations due to the acquisition of CalAtlantics Financial Services operations.Our rental apartment business has seen significant pickup in both rents and lease ups. The Multifamily segment generated $42.7 million in operating earnings in fiscal 2018, which was down from 2017 due to a strategic shift from a merchant build to sell model to a build to hold model. While we still have a pipeline of 30 merchant build communities with over 9,000 homes and a total development cost of $3.6 billion, our real focus is to create long term cash flow and value through the build out of our Lennar Multifamily Venture I and II.In fiscal 2019, we are very focused on cash flow generation to reduce debt and to opportunistically repurchase shares. To further enhance our cash flow generation, we are continuing our pivot to a land lighter operating model with an emphasis on controlling more land through options versus a more cash intensive land acquisition and development program. We ended the year with approximately 25% of our homesites controlled via option contracts and similar arrangements. Our goal is to increase this to over 40% in the next several years. We expect that this shift in land strategy should increase our returns on inventory and generate additional cash flow.We are excited about our position and business strategy today. We expect that our Companys main driver of earnings will continue to be our homebuilding and financial services operations as we expect to deliver over 50,000 homes in fiscal 2019. We benefit from the size and scale we have amassed in each of our strategic markets. We have shed non core assets to generate cash and have continued to partner with technology companies that can help enhance our customers experience while reducing our overhead. Our reversion to core and technology investment strategies have combined to enable us to rationalize our overall business, recognize significant cash flow and profits, and improve our customers experience, while reducing headcount by approximately 1,600 associates from fiscal year end through January 2019. This strategy will continue to reduce company overhead and increase efficiency in our core operations. Overall, we believe we are on track to achieve another year of strong profitability in fiscal 2019.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsOverviewOur net earnings attributable to Lennar were $1.7 billion, or $5.44 per diluted share ($5.46 per basic share) in 2018, $810.5 million, or $3.38 per diluted share ($3.38 per basic share) in 2017, and $911.8 million, or $3.86 per diluted share ($4.05 per basic share) in 2016.

Revenues were higher primarily due to a 55% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 10% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 45,563 homes in the year ended November 30, 2018 from 29,322 homes in the year ended November 30, 2017, primarily due to the significant increase in volume resulting from the CalAtlantic acquisition. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments. The average sales price of homes delivered, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to $413,000 in the year ended November 30, 2018 from $376,000 in the year ended November 30, 2017. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $23,500 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2018, or 5.4% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $22,700 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2017, or 5.7% as a percentage of home sales revenue.Gross margins on home sales were $3.7 billion, or 19.6%, in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $2.4 billion, or 22.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2017. The gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2017 primarily due to the backlog/construction in progress write up of $414.6 million related to purchase accounting adjustments on CalAtlantic homes that were delivered in the year ended November 30, 2018, which impacted gross margins on home sales by 220 basis points. In addition there was an increase in construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.6 billion in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $1.0 billion in the year ended November 30, 2017. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 8.5% in the year ended November 30, 2018, from 9.2% in the year ended November 30, 2017, primarily due to a reduction in personnel and related expenses, brokers commissions, and model and selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue. This was achieved through improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries and continued benefit from technology initiatives.Gross profits on land sales were $60.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $29.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2017. Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $91.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $61.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2017. In the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was attributable to our share of net operating losses from our unconsolidated entities which were primarily driven by valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by profits from land sales.Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $205.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $22.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017. In the year ended November 30, 2018, other income, net was primarily related to a $164.9 million gain on the sale of an 80% interest in one of our strategic joint ventures, Treasure Island Holdings.Lennar Homebuilding loss due to litigation of $140 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 was related to litigation regarding a contract we entered into in 2005 to purchase property in Maryland. As a result of the litigation, we purchased the property for $114 million, which approximated our estimate of fair value for the property. In addition, we paid approximately $124 million in interest and other closing costs and have accrued for the amount we expect to pay as reimbursement for attorneys fees.Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $316.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2018 ($301.3 million was included in costs of homes sold, $3.6 million in costs of land sold and $11.3 million in other interest expense), compared to $277.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 ($260.7 million was included in costs of homes sold, $10.0 million in costs of land sold and $7.2 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $187.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $155.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2017. Operating earnings were impacted by an increase in the segments title and mortgage operations due to the acquisition of CalAtlantics Financial Services operations, partially offset by a decrease in refinance transactions.Operating earnings for our Lennar Multifamily segment were $42.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to operating earnings of $73.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2017. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to the segments $61.2 million share of gains as a result of the sale of six operating properties by our Lennar Multifamilys unconsolidated entities and the sale of an investment in an operating property in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to the segments $96.7 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by our Lennar Multifamilys unconsolidated entities in the year ended November 30, 2017, as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended November 30, 2018. The decrease in profitability for the year ended November 30, 2018 was 25Table of Contentspartially offset by $16.2 million of promote revenue recognized in the year ended November 30, 2018 related to eight properties in LMV Fund I.On November 30, 2018, we recorded a $296.4 million gain on the sale of our Rialto investment and asset management platform. Operating loss for our Rialto segment was $18.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2018 (which included $21.6 million of operating loss and an add back of $3.3 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings for the Rialto segment in the year ended November 30, 2017 were $23.6 million (which included $22.5 million of operating loss and add back of $46.1 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). The decrease in operating earnings was primarily as a result of non recurring expenses, partially offset by a decrease in real estate owned and loan impairments due to the liquidation of the FDIC and bank portfolios and a decrease in interest expense.During the year ended November 30, 2018, we recorded $153.0 million of acquisition and integration costs that were comprised mainly of severance expenses and transaction costs and were included within the acquisition and integration costs related to CalAtlantic line item in the consolidated statement of operations.Corporate general and administrative expenses were $343.9 million, or 1.7% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2018, compared to $285.9 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2017. The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in revenues.Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were $21.7 million and ($38.7) million in the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2018 were primarily attributable to net earnings related to our Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to a net loss related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC in 2010.In the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, we had a tax provision of $545.2 million and $417.9 million, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rates were 24.3% and 34.0% for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. The tax reform bill reduced the maximum federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, which also reduced the value of our deferred tax assets. As a result, we recorded a non cash one time write down of deferred tax assets that resulted in income tax expense of $68.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.2017 versus 2016 Revenues from home sales increased 15% in the year ended November 30, 2017 to $11.0 billion from $9.6 billion in 2016. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 11% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 29,322 homes in the year ended November 30, 2017 from 26,481 homes in 2016. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2016 and by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The average sales price of homes delivered, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to $376,000 in the year ended November 30, 2017 from $361,000 in the year ended November 30, 2016, primarily due to product mix (selling at different price points) and increased pricing in certain of our markets due to favorable market conditions. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $22,700 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2017, or 5.7% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $22,500 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2016, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue.Gross margins on home sales were $2.4 billion, or 22.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $2.2 billion, or 23.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2016. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 billion in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $898.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 9.2% in the year ended November 30, 2017, from 9.4% in the year ended November 30, 2016 due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.Gross profits on land sales were $29.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $44.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2016.Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $61.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $49.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of net operating losses from 26Table of Contentsour unconsolidated entities which were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses and valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by profits from land sales. In the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination as well as our share of net operating losses associated with the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity formed as the result of this combination. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties.Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $22.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $52.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2016, other income, net included management fee income and a profit participation related to Lennar Homebuildings strategic joint ventures and gains on the sale of several clubhouses.Lennar Homebuilding loss due to litigation of $140 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, was related to litigation regarding a contract we entered into in 2005 to purchase property in Maryland. As a result of the litigation, we purchased the property for $114 million, which approximated our estimate of fair value for the property. In addition, we paid approximately $124 million in interest and other closing costs and have accrued for the amount we expect to pay as reimbursement for attorneys fees.Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $277.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 ($260.7 million was included in costs of homes sold, $10.0 million in costs of land sold and $7.2 million in other interest expense), compared to $245.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2016 ($235.1 million was included in costs of homes sold, $5.3 million in costs of land sold and $4.6 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $155.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $163.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. Operating earnings decreased due to lower profitability in the segments mortgage operations as a result of a decrease in refinance transactions, which led to both lower origination volume and profit per loan. This was partially offset by higher profit per transaction in the segments title operations and earnings from the real estate brokerage business which was acquired as part of the WCI Communities, Inc. ("WCI") acquisition in February 2017.Operating earnings for our Lennar Multifamily segment were $73.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to operating earnings of $71.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the segments $96.7 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamilys unconsolidated entities, compared to the segments $91.0 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamilys unconsolidated entities in the year ended November 30, 2016. Operating earnings for our Rialto segment were $23.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 (which included $22.5 million of operating loss and an add back of $46.1 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings in the year ended November 30, 2016 were $2.1 million (which included $16.7 million of operating loss and add back of $18.8 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). The increase in operating earnings was primarily related to an increase in incentive income related to carried interest distributions from the Rialto real estate funds, as well as an increase in management fee income and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by an increase in REO and loan impairments and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the year ended November 30, 2016 included a $16.0 million write off of uncollectible receivables related to a hospital, which was acquired through the resolution of one of Rialtos loans from a 2010 portfolio.Corporate general and administrative expenses were $285.9 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $232.6 million, or 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to personnel and related expenses and professional expenses related to technology investments.Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were ($38.7) million and $1.2 million in the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to net loss related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC in 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures, partially offset by a net loss related to the FDICs interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC.In the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, we had a tax provision of $417.9 million and $417.4 million, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rates were 34.0% and 31.4% for the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is primarily the result of the new energy efficient home credits expiring during the year ended November 30, 2017, which increased our effective tax rate by 1.74%. For the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the impact of this tax credit was (0.73%) and (2.47%), respectively. 27Table of ContentsHomebuilding Segments Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first time, move up, active adult and luxury homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and attempt to minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures. In connection with the CalAtlantic acquisition, we experienced significant growth in our homebuilding operations. As a result, our chief operating decision makers ("CODM") reassessed how they evaluate the business and allocate resources. The CODM manages and assesses our performance at a regional level. Therefore, we performed an assessment of our operating segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, (ASC 280) and determined that each of our four homebuilding regions, financial services operations, multifamily operations and Rialto operations are our operating segments. Prior to this change, in accordance with the aggregation criteria defined in ASC 280, our operating segments were aggregated into reportable segments, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography, and product type.As of and for the year ended November 30, 2018, we have determined that each of our homebuilding regions are our homebuilding operating segments and consist of Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, Homebuilding Texas, and Homebuilding West. Information about homebuilding activities in our urban divisions that do not have economic characteristics similar to those in other divisions within the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not a reportable segment. All prior periods have been adjusted to conform with our current presentation.References in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those four reportable segments.At November 30, 2018 our homebuilding operating segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in:East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina and South CarolinaCentral: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and VirginiaTexas: TexasWest: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and WashingtonOther: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments, including FivePoint28Table of ContentsThe following tables set forth selected financial and operational information related to our homebuilding operations for the years indicated:Selected Financial and Operational Data Years Ended November 30,(In thousands)2018 2017 2016Homebuilding revenues: East: Sales of homes$6,193,868 4,023,150 3,272,884Sales of land55,996 31,699 53,666Total East6,249,864 4,054,849 3,326,550Central: Sales of homes2,260,105 915,835 919,562Sales of land30,782 7,683 9,418Total Central2,290,887 923,518 928,980Texas: Sales of homes2,366,844 1,651,619 1,495,351Sales of land54,555 46,112 47,761Total Texas2,421,399 1,697,731 1,543,112West: Sales of homes7,934,138 4,379,776 3,782,665Sales of land125,712 67,308 65,874Total West8,059,850 4,447,084 3,848,539Other: Sales of homes55,597 64,919 88,055Sales of land 12,141 6,101Total Other55,597 77,060 94,156Total homebuilding revenues$19,077,597 11,200,242 9,741,33729Table of Contents Years Ended November 30,(In thousands)2018 2017 2016Operating earnings (loss): East: Sales of homes$728,934 569,145 523,961Sales of land20,287 5,593 21,986Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities(818) (754) (230)Other income, net10,818 1,717 16,358Total East759,221 575,701 562,075Central: Sales of homes180,150 86,847 84,925Sales of land909 (491) 2,661Equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities691 (255) (74)Other income, net858 1,598 622Loss due to litigation (1) (140,000) Total Central182,608 (52,301) 88,134Texas: Sales of homes165,094 174,188 161,893Sales of land10,808 8,615 8,319Equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities469 8 364Other expense, net(3,922) (2,599) (265)Total Texas172,449 180,212 170,311West: Sales of homes1,029,251 601,235 544,783Sales of land30,375 12,896 9,228Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (2)(212) (13,095) (2,052)Other income, net22,888 14,880 33,914Total West1,082,302 615,916 585,873Other: Sales of homes(22,779) (13,310) (18,815)Sales of land(2,305) 3,255 2,515Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (3)(92,045) (47,612) (47,283)Other income, net (4)175,199 7,178 2,122Total Other58,070 (50,489) (61,461)Total homebuilding operating earnings$2,254,650 1,269,039 1,344,932(1)Loss due to litigation regarding a contract we entered into in 2005 to purchase property in Maryland.

Revenues from home sales also increased as a result of the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas, partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in New Jersey. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities including communities acquired from CalAtlantic. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher priced communities, including higher priced communities acquired from CalAtlantic. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in New Jersey was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher priced communities and opening lower priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2018. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2018 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to increases in construction and land costs per home and purchase accounting adjustments on CalAtlantic homes that were in backlog/construction in progress when we acquired CalAtlantic, which reduced the gross margin percentage on those deliveries. This was partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Homebuilding Central: Revenues from home sales increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities including communities acquired from CalAtlantic. The average sales prices in the segment decreased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to communities acquired from CalAtlantic in Indiana and Illinois, which are lower priced communities, and a decrease in average sales prices in Georgia and Minnesota. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Georgia and Minnesota was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher priced communities and opening lower priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2018. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2018 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to increases in construction and land costs per home and purchase accounting adjustments on CalAtlantic homes that were in backlog/construction in progress when we acquired CalAtlantic, which reduced the gross margin percentage on those deliveries.Homebuilding Texas: Revenues from home sales increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and in the average sales price of homes delivered. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities including communities acquired from CalAtlantic. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher priced communities, including higher priced communities acquired from CalAtlantic. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2018 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to increases in construction and land costs per home and purchase accounting adjustments on CalAtlantic homes that were in backlog/construction in progress when we acquired CalAtlantic, which reduced the gross margin percentage on those deliveries. This was partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Homebuilding West: Revenues from home sales increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities including communities acquired from CalAtlantic. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher priced communities, including higher priced communities acquired from CalAtlantic.

Revenues from home sales also increased as a result of the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas, partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in New Jersey. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities during 2017 primarily related to the WCI acquisition. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in Florida and the Carolinas was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher priced communities and favorable market conditions. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in New Jersey was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher priced communities and opening lower priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2017. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Homebuilding Central: Revenues from home sales decreased slightly in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Georgia and Virginia and a slight decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. This was partially offset by an increase in the number of home deliveries in Minnesota and Tennessee. The decrease in the number of deliveries in Georgia and Virginia was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries per active community as a result of timing of opening and closing of communities. The increase in the number of deliveries in Minnesota and Tennessee was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in all states in Homebuilding Central, was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher priced communities and opening lower priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2017. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in land and direct construction costs per home.Homebuilding Texas: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. The increase in the number of deliveries in Homebuilding Texas was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased and the number of active communities increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales for the year ended November 30, 2017 decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in land and direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.Homebuilding West: Revenues from home sales increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment, except Colorado and an increase in the average sales price in all the states in the segment, except Oregon. The increase in the number of home deliveries is primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the number of deliveries in Colorado was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries per active community as a result of timing of opening and closing of communities. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix and favorable market conditions. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Oregon was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher priced communities and opening lower priced communities during the year ended November 30, 2017.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, a majority of them on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Occasional claims of this type are a normal incident of our loan securitization activities. We do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business. 36Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth selected financial and operational information related to our Lennar Financial Services segment: Years Ended November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 2017 2016Revenues$867,831 770,109 687,255Costs and expenses680,401 614,585 523,638Operating earnings$187,430 155,524 163,617Dollar value of mortgages originated$11,079,000 8,973,000 9,343,000Number of mortgages originated36,500 31,600 33,500Mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers73% 80% 82%Number of title and closing service transactions118,000 110,000 116,000Number of title policies issued297,600 314,800 298,900Subsequent to November 30, 2018, we sold the majority of our retail title business, our title insurance underwriting business, and our real estate brokerage business and contracted to sell our business of offering residential mortgages to non Lennar homebuyers.Lennar Multifamily SegmentWe have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties.

Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital were calculated as follows: November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 2017Lennar Homebuilding debt$8,543,868 6,410,003Stockholders equity14,581,535 7,872,317Total capital$23,125,403 14,282,320Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital36.9% 44.9%Lennar Homebuilding debt$8,543,868 6,410,003Less: Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents1,337,807 2,282,925Net Lennar Homebuilding debt$7,206,061 4,127,078Lennar Homebuilding net debt to total capital (1)33.1% 34.4% (1)Lennar Homebuilding net debt to total capital is a non GAAP financial measure defined as net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity). We believe the ratio of net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our Lennar Homebuilding operations. However, because net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results.At November 30, 2018, Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in stockholders equity primarily related to the issuance of shares in connection with the CalAtlantic acquisition and net earnings, partially offset by an increase in homebuilding debt primarily related to an increase in Lennar Homebuilding debt due to the CalAtlantic acquisition.We are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity, the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and or pursuing other financing alternatives. In connection with some of our non homebuilding businesses, we are also considering other types of transactions such as sales, restructuring, joint ventures, spin offs or initial public offerings as we intend to move back towards being a pure play homebuilding company over time. On November 30, 2018, we sold the Rialto Management Group. However, we retained the right to receive carried interest distributions from some of the funds and other investment vehicles. We also retained limited partner investments in Rialto funds and investment vehicles that totaled $297.4 million at November 30, 2018, and are committed to invest as much as an additional $71.6 million in Rialto funds.41Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our Lennar Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable: November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 20170.25% convertible senior notes due 2019$1,291 4.500% senior notes due 2019499,585 498,7934.50% senior notes due 2019599,176 598,3256.625% senior notes due 2020 (1)311,735 2.95% senior notes due 2020298,838 298,3058.375% senior notes due 2021 (1)435,897 4.750% senior notes due 2021498,111 497,3296.25% senior notes due December 2021 (1)315,283 4.125% senior notes due 2022596,894 595,9045.375% senior notes due 2022 (1)261,055 4.750% senior notes due 2022570,564 569,4844.875% senior notes due December 2023395,759 394,9644.500% senior notes due 2024646,078 645,3535.875% senior notes due 2024 (1)452,833 4.750% senior notes due 2025497,114 496,6715.25% senior notes due 2026 (1)409,133 5.00% senior notes due 2027 (1)353,275 4.75% senior notes due 2027892,297 892,6574.125% senior notes due December 2018 274,4596.95% senior notes due 2018 249,342Mortgage notes on land and other debt508,950 398,417 $8,543,868 6,410,003(1)These notes were obligations of CalAtlantic when it was acquired, and were subsequently exchanged in part for notes of Lennar Corporation as follows: $267.7 million principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due 2020, $397.6 million principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2021, $292.0 million principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due 2021, $240.8 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2022, $421.4 million principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2024, $395.5 million principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2026 and $347.3 million principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due 2027.

The majority of our short term financing needs, including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs, are met with cash generated from operations, proceeds from debt as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility.42Table of ContentsThe terms of each of our senior notes outstanding at November 30, 2018 were as follows:Senior Notes Outstanding (1) Principal Amount Net Proceeds (2) Price Dates Issued(Dollars in thousands) 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 $1,300 (3) (3) (3)4.500% senior notes due 2019 500,000 495,725 (4) February 20144.50% senior notes due 2019 600,000 595,801 (5) November 2014, February 20156.625% senior notes due 2020 300,000 (3) (3) (3)2.95% senior notes due 2020 300,000 298,800 100% November 20178.375% senior notes due 2021 400,000 (3) (3) (3)4.750% senior notes due 2021 500,000 495,974 100% March 20166.25% senior notes due December 2021 300,000 (3) (3) (3)4.125% senior notes due 2022 600,000 595,160 100% January 20175.375% senior notes due 2022 250,000 (3) (3) (3)4.750% senior notes due 2022 575,000 567,585 (6) October 2012, February 2013, April 20134.875% senior notes due December 2023 400,000 393,622 99.169% November 20154.500% senior notes due 2024 650,000 644,838 100% April 20175.875% senior notes due 2024 425,000 (3) (3) (3)4.750% senior notes due 2025 500,000 495,528 100% April 20155.25% senior notes due 2026 400,000 (3) (3) (3)5.00% senior notes due 2027 350,000 (3) (3) (3)4.75% senior notes due 2027 900,000 894,650 100% November 2017(1)Interest is payable semi annually for each of the series of senior notes. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, but are guaranteed by substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries.(2)We generally use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, which can include the repayment or repurchase of other outstanding senior notes.(3)These notes were obligations of CalAtlantic when it was acquired, and were subsequently exchanged in part for notes of Lennar Corporation. As part of purchase accounting, the senior notes have been recorded at their fair value as of the date of acquisition (February 12, 2018).(4)We issued $400 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100% and $100 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100.5%.(5)We issued $350 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100% and $250 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100.25%.(6)We issued $350 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 100%, $175 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 98.073% and $50 million aggregate principal amount at a price of 98.250%.During the second quarter of 2018, holders of $6.7 million principal amount of CalAtlantics 1.625% convertible senior notes due 2018 and $266.2 million principal amount of CalAtlantics 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 either caused us to purchase them for cash or converted them into a combination of our Class A and Class B common stock and cash, resulting in our issuing approximately 3,654,000 shares of Class A common stock and 72,000 shares of Class B common stock, and paying $59.1 million in cash to former noteholders. All but $1.3 million of the principal balance of the convertible senior notes had either been converted or redeemed. In November 2018, we redeemed $275 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% Senior Notes. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 100% of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest.In June 2018, we redeemed $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.95% Senior Notes. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 100% of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest. In May 2018, we redeemed $575 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.375% Senior Notes. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 100% of the principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest. The 8.375% Senior Notes with $575 million of principal amount were obligations of CalAtlantic when it was acquired and $485.6 million principal amount was subsequently exchanged in part for notes of Lennar Corporation. Currently, substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing all our senior notes (the "Guaranteed Notes"). The guarantees are full and unconditional. The principal reason our 100% owned homebuilding 43Table of Contentssubsidiaries are guaranteeing the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect with regard to a guarantor subsidiary only while it guarantees a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporations debt, the guarantor subsidiarys guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Therefore, if the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporations obligations under our Credit Facility and our letter of credit facilities and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporations debt other than the Guaranteed Notes.If our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporations borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. A subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of.In February 2018, we amended the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility to increase the maximum borrowings from $2.0 billion to $2.6 billion and extended the maturity on $2.2 billion of the Credit Facility from June 2022 to April 2023, with $70 million that matured in June 2018 and the remaining $50 million maturing in June 2020. As of November 30, 2018, the Credit Facility included a $315 million accordion feature, subject to additional commitments. The proceeds available under the Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement also provides that up to $500 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. As of both November 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Under the Credit Facility agreement, we are required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. These ratios are calculated per the Credit Facility agreement, which involves adjustments to GAAP financial measures. We believe we are in compliance with our debt covenants at November 30, 2018. In addition, we had $285 million in letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions at November 30, 2018.Under the amended Credit Agreement executed in February 2018 (the " Credit Agreement"), as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of approximately $6.0 billion plus the sum of 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income for each completed fiscal quarter subsequent to February 28, 2018, if positive, and 50% of the net cash proceeds from any equity offerings from and after February 28, 2018, minus the lesser of 50% of the amount paid after February 12, 2018 to repurchase common stock and $100 million. We are required to maintain a leverage ratio that shall not exceed 65% and may be reduced by 2.5% per quarter if our interest coverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters. The leverage ratio will have a floor of 60%. If our interest coverage ratio subsequently exceeds 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters, the leverage ratio we will be required to maintain will be increased by 2.5% per quarter to a maximum of 65%. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are also required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. We believe that we were in compliance with our debt covenants at November 30, 2018.The following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2018:(Dollars in thousands)Covenant Level Level Achieved as of November 30, 2018Minimum net worth test$6,539,138 9,392,336Maximum leverage ratio65.0% 40.1%Liquidity test (1)1.00 3.30(1)We are only required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio of equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. Although we are in compliance with our debt covenants for both calculations, we have only disclosed our liquidity test.The terms minimum net worth test, maximum leverage ratio, liquidity test and interest coverage ratio used in the Credit Agreement are specifically calculated per the Credit Agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable GAAP or common usage terms.Our performance letters of credit outstanding were $598.4 million and $384.4 million at November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were $165.4 million and $127.4 million at November 30, 2018 and 44Table of Contents2017, respectively. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the performance of certain development and construction activities. Financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds of $2.7 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds.At November 30, 2018, the Lennar Financial Services segment warehouse facilities were as follows:(In thousands)Maximum Aggregate Commitment364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures December 2018 (1)$400,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures March 2019 (2)300,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures June 2019700,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures October 2019 (3)500,000Total$1,900,000(1)Subsequent to November 30, 2018, the maturity date was extended to February 2019. Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of $250 million. (2)Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of $300 million.(3)Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of $400 million.Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. Borrowings under the facilities and their prior year predecessors were $1.3 billion and $937.2 million, at November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold to investors but not yet paid for with outstanding principal balances of $1.3 billion and $974.1 million, at November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2018 was 4.5%. If the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be paid off by selling the mortgage loans held for sale to investors and by collecting on receivables on loans sold but not yet paid. Without the facilities, the Lennar Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities.At November 30, 2018, RMF warehouse facilities were as follows:(In thousands)Maximum Aggregate Commitment364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures November 2019$200,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures December 2019200,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures December 2019250,000364 day warehouse repurchase facility that matures December 2019200,000Total Loans origination and securitization business$850,000Warehouse repurchase facility that matures December 2019 (two one year extensions) (1)50,000Total$900,000(1)Rialto uses this warehouse repurchase facility to finance the origination of floating rate accrual loans, which are reported as accrual loans within loans receivable, net. There were no borrowings under this facility as of both November 30, 2018 and 2017.Borrowings under the facilities that finance RMFs loan originations and securitization activities were $178.8 million and $162.1 million as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were secured by a 75% interest in the originated commercial loans financed. The facilities require immediate repayment of the 75% interest in the secured commercial loans when the loans are sold in a securitization and the proceeds are collected. These warehouse repurchase facilities are non recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature.In March 2018, Rialto paid off the remaining principal balance of its 7.00% senior notes due December 2018 (the "7.00% Senior Notes"). As of November 30, 2017, the carrying amount, net of debt issuance costs, of the 7.00% Senior Notes was $349.4 million.Changes in Capital StructureWe had a stock repurchase program adopted in 2001, which originally authorized us to purchase up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock. During the year ended November 30, 2018, under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock for $249.9 million at an average share price of $41.63. During the 45Table of Contentsyears ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. Subsequent to November 30, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to the lesser of $1 billion in value, or 25 million in shares, of our outstanding Class A or Class B common stock. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.During the years ended November 30, 2018, treasury stock increased by 7.0 million shares of Class A common stock due primarily to 6.0 million shares of common stock repurchased during the year through our stock repurchase program. During the year ended November 30, 2017, treasury stock increased by 0.6 million shares of Class A common stock primarily due to activity related to our equity compensation plan. During the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our Class A and Class B common stockholders received an aggregate per share annual dividend of $0.16. Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsLennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesAt November 30, 2018, we had equity investments in 59 homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 5 had recourse debt, 10 had non recourse debt and 44 had no debt), compared to 38 homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2017. At November 30, 2018, the 59 unconsolidated joint ventures includes 20 unconsolidated entities in which CalAtlantic or a subsidiary is the participant. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers. Additionally in recent years, we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners.Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and or sell specific assets during a limited life time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment guarantees generally is required.Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro rata share of joint ventures earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures or reduce the investment in certain cost sharing unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third party homebuyer.46Table of ContentsIn many instances, we are designated as the manager of a venture under the direction of a management committee that has shared power among the partners of the unconsolidated entity and we receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option or purchase contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts, in some instances, require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits are generally negotiated on a case by case basis.We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments may be subject to a variety of financial and non financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment.Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third party debt to finance their activities. In some instances, the debt financing is non recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment or maintenance guarantees.Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes.The joint ventures often enter into option or purchase agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements.As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cycle.We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns on capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities. 47Table of ContentsSummarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:Statements of Operations and Selected Information Years Ended November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 2017 2016Revenues$525,931 471,899 439,874Costs and expenses729,700 616,217 578,831Other income, net (1)186,982 23,253 Net loss of unconsolidated entities (1)$(16,787) (121,065) (138,957)Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities (1)$(91,915) (61,708) (49,275)Lennar Homebuilding cumulative share of net earnings deferred at November 30$35,233 47,621 41,495Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities (2)$996,926 900,769 811,723Equity of the unconsolidated entities$4,238,265 4,196,811 3,765,336Lennar Homebuilding investment % in the unconsolidated entities (3)24% 21% 22%(1)During the year ended November 30, 2018, other income was primarily due to FivePoint recording income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017s reduction in its corporate tax rate to reduce its liability pursuant to its tax receivable agreement (TRA Liability) with its non controlling interests. However, we have a 70% interest in the FivePoint TRA Liability. Therefore, we did not include in Lennar Homebuildings equity in loss from unconsolidated entities the pro rata share of earnings related to our portion of the TRA Liability. As a result, our unconsolidated entities have net losses of only $16.8 million, but we have an equity in loss from unconsolidated entities of $91.9 million. (2)Does not include the ($62.0) million investment balance for one unconsolidated entity as it was reclassed to other liabilities.(3)Our share of profit and cash distributions from operations could be higher compared to our ownership interest in unconsolidated entities if certain specified internal rate of return or cash flow milestones are achieved.For the year ended November 30, 2018, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities wasprimarily attributable to our share of net operating losses from our unconsolidated entities which were primarily driven by valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by profits from land sales.For the year ended November 30, 2017, one of our unconsolidated entities had equity in earnings of $11.9 million relating to an equity method investee selling 475 homesites to a third party land bank. Simultaneous with the purchase by the land bank, we entered into an option contract to purchase all 475 homesites from the land bank. Due to our continuing involvement with respect to the homesites sold from the investee entity, we deferred all of our equity in earnings from the unconsolidated entity relating to the sale transaction, which amounted to $4.9 million. For the year ended November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of net operating losses from our unconsolidated entities, which were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses and valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by the profits from land sales.For the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination and operational net losses from the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity, totaling $42.6 million. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties by one of our unconsolidated entities.48Table of ContentsBalance Sheets November 30,(In thousands)2018 2017Assets: Cash and cash equivalents$782,565 953,261Inventories4,291,470 3,751,525Other assets1,251,884 1,061,507 $6,325,919 5,766,293Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities$875,380 832,151Debt (1)1,212,274 737,331Equity4,238,265 4,196,811 $6,325,919 5,766,293(1)Debt is net of debt issuance costs of $12.4 million and $5.7 million, for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in debt in 2018 was primarily related to $500 million of senior notes issued by FivePoint.In May 2017, FivePoint completed its initial public offering ("IPO"). Concurrent with the IPO, we invested an additional $100 million in FivePoint in a private placement. As of November 30, 2018, we own approximately 40% of FivePoint and the carrying amount of our investment is $342.7 million.As of November 30, 2018 and 2017, our recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were $996.9 million and $900.8 million, respectively, while the underlying equity in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners net assets as of both November 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion. The basis difference is primarily as a result of us contributing our investment in three strategic joint ventures with a higher fair value than book value for an investment in the FivePoint entity and deferring equity in earnings on land sales to us.The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities.Debt to total capital of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was calculated as follows: November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 2017Debt$1,212,274 737,331Equity4,238,265 4,196,811Total capital$5,450,539 4,934,142Debt to total capital of our unconsolidated entities22.2% 14.9%Our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows: November 30,(In thousands)2018 2017Land development$814,835 841,507Homebuilding64,523 32,754Strategic technology investments117,568 26,508Total investments (1)$996,926 900,769(1)Does not include the ($62.0) million investment balance for one unconsolidated entity as it was reclassed to other liabilities.Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets.

We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt of another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.49Table of ContentsIn connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender, either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from "bad boy acts" of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of an unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee).The total debt of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, including Lennars maximum recourse exposure, was as follows: November 30,(Dollars in thousands)2018 2017Non recourse bank debt and other debt (partners share of several recourse)$48,313 64,197Non recourse land seller debt and other debt 1,997Non recourse debt with completion guarantees239,568 255,903Non recourse debt without completion guarantees (1)871,088 351,800Non recourse debt to Lennar1,158,969 673,897Lennars maximum recourse exposure (2)65,707 69,181Debt issuance costs$(12,402) (5,747)Total debt$1,212,274 737,331Lennars maximum recourse exposure as a % of total JV debt5% 9%(1)The increase in non recourse debt without completion guarantees was primarily related to $500 million of senior notes issued by FivePoint.(2)As of November 30, 2018 and 2017, our maximum recourse exposure was primarily related to us providing a repayment guarantee on four unconsolidated entities debt and three unconsolidated entities debt, respectively.During the year ended November 30, 2018, our maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities decreased by $3.5 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $13.0 million decrease in maximum recourse indebtedness resulting from a joint venture selling assets, partially offset by us providing a repayment guarantee on unconsolidated entities debt of $2.6 million on Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities debt, an increase in recourse debt due to additional borrowings of $6.2 million.The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guarantees.In addition, in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral.In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, we and our joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.If we are required to make a payment under any guarantee, the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes.As of both November 30, 2018 and 2017, the fair values of the repayment and completion guarantees were not material. We believe that as of November 30, 2018, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, the collateral is expected to be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, we have placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for our joint ventures (see Note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).In view of credit market conditions during the past several years, it is not uncommon for lenders and or real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, to assert non monetary defaults (such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts) or technical monetary 50Table of Contentsdefaults against the real estate developers. In most instances, those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms, additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers. In addition, in some instances, real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms, which are often, but not always obtained. However, in some instances developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders, and are thus declared in default. Because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests, when these joint ventures default on their obligations, lenders may or may not have claims against us. Normally, we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders. When it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment, we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability. Although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them, at any point in time it is possible that we will have some balance of unpaid guarantee liability. At both November 30, 2018 and 2017, we had no liabilities accrued for unpaid guarantees of joint venture indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets.The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities ("JVs") debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2018 and it does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.

Treasure Island Community Development is no longer included above due to the sale of an 80% interest in Treasure Island Holdings.(4)Includes CPHP Development, LLC which has assets of $261.2 million, maximum recourse debt exposure to Lennar of $52.2 million, total JV debt of $333.8 million, and total JV equity of ($96.7) million. Lennars investment balance does not include the ($62.0) million investment as it was reclassed to other liabilities.Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesAt November 30, 2018, Lennar Multifamily had equity investments in 22 unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 8 had non recourse debt and 14 had no debt), compared to 27 unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2017. We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.The Venture Fund is a long term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class A multifamily assets with $2.2 billion in equity commitments, including a $504 million co investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. The Venture Fund is currently seeded with 39 undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased or under contract by the Lennar Multifamily segment totaling approximately 11,700 apartments with projected project costs of $4.1 billion as of November 30, 2018. There are 17 completed and operating multifamily assets with 4,900 apartments. During the year ended November 30, 2018, $384.3 million in equity commitments were called, of which we contributed $90.1 million. During the year ended November 30, 2018, we received $18.0 million of distributions as a return of capital from the Venture Fund. As of November 30, 2018, $1.8 billion of the $2.2 billion in equity commitments had been called, of which we had contributed $440.8 million representing our pro rata portion of the called equity, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for us of $63.2 million. As of November 30, 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of our investment in the Venture Fund was $383.4 million and $323.8 million, respectively.In March 2018, the Lennar Multifamily segment completed the first closing of a second Lennar Multifamily Venture, Venture Fund II, for the development, construction and property management of class A multifamily assets. As of November 30, 2018, Venture Fund II had approximately $787 million of equity commitments, including a $255 million co investment commitment by Lennar comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. As of and for the year ended November 30, 2018, $252.1 million in equity commitments were called, of which we contributed our portion of $81.2 million, which was made up of $188.4 million in inventory and cash contributions, offset by $107.2 million of distributions as a return of capital, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for us of $173.8 million. As of November 30, 2018, the carrying value of our investment in Venture Fund II was $63.0 million. The difference between our net contributions and the carrying value of our investments was related to a basis difference. Venture Fund II is currently seeded with eight undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased by the Lennar Multifamily segment totaling approximately 3,000 apartments with projected project costs of approximately $1.3 billion as of November 30, 2018.The joint ventures are typically structured through non corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro rata cash contributions to the joint venture except for cost over runs relating to the construction of the project. In all cases, we have been required to provide guarantees of completion and cost over runs to the lenders and partners. These completion guarantees may require us to complete the improvements for which the financing was obtained. Therefore, our risk is limited to our equity contribution, draws on letters of credit and potential future payments under the guarantees of completion and cost over runs. In certain instances, payments made under the cost over run guarantees are considered capital contributions.Additionally, the joint ventures obtain third party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of the rental projects. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, the joint venture debt does not have repayment or maintenance guarantees. Neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In some cases, we agree to provide credit support in the form of a letter of credit provided to the bank.We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate 52Table of Contentsand assess possible impairment of our investment. We believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at November 30, 2018.Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro rata basis based on our ownership percentages. Most joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return).In many instances, we are designated as the development manager and or the general contractor and or the property manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we generally do not plan to enter into purchase contracts to acquire rental properties from our Lennar Multifamily joint ventures.Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us or the other partners, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them.As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity by entity basis depending on each entitys purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition, development and construction of multifamily rental properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated will be available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint ventures members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint ventures activities and the stage in the joint ventures life cycle.Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Multifamilys investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:Balance Sheets November 30,(In thousands)2018 2017Assets: Cash and cash equivalents$61,571 37,073Operating properties and equipment3,708,613 2,952,070Other assets40,899 36,772 $3,811,083 3,025,915Liabilities and equity: Accounts payable and other liabilities$199,119 212,123Notes payable (1)1,381,656 879,047Equity2,230,308 1,934,745 $3,811,083 3,025,915(1)Notes payable are net of debt issuance costs of $15.7 million and $17.6 million, for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.53Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of November 30, 2018 and does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.

During each of the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the Lennar Multifamily segment sold seven operating properties through its unconsolidated entities resulting in the segments $96.7 million and $91.0 million share of gains, respectively.(2)Our share of profit and cash distributions from sales of operating properties could be higher compared to our ownership interest in unconsolidated entities if certain specified internal rate of return milestones are achieved.Rialto Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesRialto was the sponsor of and an investor in private equity vehicles that invest in and manage real estate related assets and other related investments. We sold our Rialto Management Group on November 30, 2018. We retained our fund investments along with our carried interests in various Rialto funds and investments in other Rialto balance sheet assets. Our limited partner investments in Rialto funds and investment vehicles totaled $297.4 million at November 30, 2018, and we are committed to invest as much as an additional $71.6 million in Rialto funds.As part of the sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform, we retained our ability to receive a portion of payments with regard to carried interests if funds meet specified performance thresholds. We will periodically receive advance distributions related to the carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to the carried interests. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks but will reduce future carried interest payments to which we become entitled from the applicable funds and have been recorded as revenues. 54Table of ContentsAdvanced and carried interest distributions received during the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $25.5 million, $44.2 million and $10.1 million, respectively. The following table represents amounts we would have received had the funds ceased operations and hypothetically liquidated all their investments at their estimated fair values on November 30, 2018, both gross and net of amounts already received as advanced tax distributions.

Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or make a significant deposit for optioned land, we may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land.During the year ended November 30, 2018, consolidated inventory not owned decreased by $184.3 million with a corresponding decrease to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily related to a higher amount of homesite takedowns than construction started on homesites not owned. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, we had a net reclassification related to option deposits from consolidated inventory not owned to land under development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2018. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits.Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs totaling $209.5 million and $137.0 million at November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, we had posted $72.4 million and $51.8 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.56Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at November 30, 2018: Payments Due by Period(In thousands)Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 yearsLennar Homebuilding Senior notes and other debts payable (1)$8,467,148 1,270,534 1,712,372 1,809,496 3,674,746Lennar Financial Services Notes and other debts payable1,256,174 1,256,174 Rialto Notes and other debts payable (2)325,725 193,316 1,121 15,596 115,692Interest commitments under interest bearing debt (3)1,860,229 406,628 640,439 416,074 397,088Operating leases230,905 55,302 86,644 46,891 42,068Other contractual obligations (4)308,642 179,737 128,905 Total contractual obligations (5)$12,448,823 3,361,691 2,569,481 2,288,057 4,229,594(1)The amounts presented in the table above exclude debt issuance costs and any discounts/premiums and purchase accounting adjustments.(2)Primarily includes notes payable and other debts payable of $178.8 million related to the Rialto warehouse repurchase facilities, used by RMF, and $132.4 million related to Rialtos long term loan facilities ("CMBS Loan Facilities") to finance the purchase of CMBS. These amounts exclude debt issuance costs and any discounts/premiums.(3)Interest commitments on variable interest bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of November 30, 2018.(4)Amounts include $63.2 million remaining equity commitment to fund the Venture Fund for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects, $173.8 million remaining equity commitment to fund Venture Fund II for future expenditures related to construction and development of projects and $71.6 million of commitments to invest in Rialto funds.(5)Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling $67.6 million as of November 30, 2018, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2018, we had access to 68,623 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2018, we had $209.5 million of non refundable option deposits and pre acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $72.4 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts.At November 30, 2018, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $763.8 million (which included the $72.4 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2018, we had outstanding surety bonds of $2.7 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2018, there were approximately $1.4 billion, or 52%, of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds or letters of credit, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our Lennar Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $3.5 billion at November 30, 2018. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $584 million as of November 30, 2018. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts, futures contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and the 57Table of Contentsoption contracts. At November 30, 2018, we had open commitments amounting to $1.5 billion to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2019 and there were no open futures contracts.The following sections discuss market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business:Market and Financing RiskWe finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Lennar Multifamily activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, debt and equity issuances, as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility and warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options. We try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered in the prior economic downturn.Interest Rates and Changing PricesInflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.Business AcquisitionsIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), we account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price of the transaction to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any amount of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We believe that the accounting estimate for business combinations is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We develop our estimate of fair value through various valuation methods, including the use of discounted expected future cash flows based on market based assessments. These assessments are based on current market valuations as well as the current and anticipated future economic conditions in each of our markets. Given these estimates and assumptions of cash flows are based on market conditions that are inherently uncertain, changes in the accuracy of the estimates and assumptions could be affected.GoodwillWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with the recent acquisition of CalAtlantic. We record goodwill associated with acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350"), we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis. We evaluate potential impairment by comparing the 58Table of Contentscarrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair values. We believe that the accounting estimate for goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units. We estimate fair value through various valuation methods, including the use of discounted expected future cash flows of each reporting unit. The expected future cash flows for each segment are significantly impacted by current market conditions. If these market conditions and resulting expected future cash flows for each reporting unit decline significantly, the actual results for each segment could differ from our estimate, which would cause goodwill to be impaired. Our accounting for goodwill represents our best estimate of future events.Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily OperationsLennar Homebuilding Revenue RecognitionRevenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.Lennar Multifamily Revenue RecognitionOur Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments. As a result, our Lennar Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are included in Lennar Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, our Lennar Multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method. We believe that the accounting policy related to Lennar Multifamily revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our Lennar Multifamilys revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment builds more rental properties.InventoriesInventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 1,324 and 761 active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, we identify communities in which to assess if the carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. Although gross margin percentages for the year ended November 30, 2018 have decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2017 primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments and an increase in direct construction costs, revenues have increased for all of our Homebuilding segments, compared to the year ended November 30, 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all of our Homebuilding segments resulting primarily from the acquisition of CalAtlantic.We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. 59Table of ContentsEach of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. Our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basis.In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales and the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow model, we analyze our historical absorption pace and historical sales prices in the community and in other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, we consider internal and external market studies and place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics and forecasts on population demographics and on sales prices in neighboring communities, unemployment rates and availability and sales price of competing product in the geographical area where the community is located as well as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters and the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities. Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace and sales prices in the cash flow model for a community.In order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes, we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Those costs assumed are used in our cash flow models for our communities.Since the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future.Using all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. We generally use a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory.We estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause us to re evaluate our strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and or additional write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts.We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. A majority of our option contracts require a non refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property under option. Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re evaluate the likelihood of exercising our land options.If we intend to walk away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre acquisition costs associated with the option contract.We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 60Table of ContentsOur evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, managements projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future.Product WarrantyAlthough we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment.At November 30, 2018, the reserve for warranty costs was $319.1 million, which included $3.1 million of adjustments to pre existing warranties from changes in estimates during the current year primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other adjustments as well as $141.0 million of warranties assumed related to the CalAtlantic acquisition. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesWe strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties, (2) for construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers or (3) for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Additionally in recent years, we have invested in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry in order to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies. Our Lennar Multifamily partners are all financial partners.Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de facto agent, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities" and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities," as described in Note 5 and Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For most unconsolidated entities, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro rata basis based upon ownership percentages. However, certain Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance.Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence.We believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2018, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $6.3 61Table of Contentsbillion and total liabilities of $2.1 billion. At November 30, 2018, the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of $3.8 billion and total liabilities of $1.6 billion.We evaluate the long lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other than temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value.The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors.Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities or operating assets by the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities. Such long lived assets are also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities. The unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of between 10% and 20% in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived.Additionally, we evaluate if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management and other factors such as age of the venture, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.We believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from managements assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesGAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JVs assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.62Table of ContentsGenerally, our unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. The accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination of whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment.Lennar Financial Services OperationsRevenue RecognitionTitle premiums on policies issued directly by us are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by us. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held for sale and loans held for investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.Loan Origination LiabilitiesSubstantially all of the loans our Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. Over the last several years there has been an industry wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. A number of claims of that type have been brought against us. We do not believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business.Our mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While we believe that we have adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. This allowance requires managements judgment and estimates. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate.Rialto Mortgage Finance Loans Held for SaleThe originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held for sale and are recorded at fair value. We elected the fair value option for RMFs loans held for sale in accordance with ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in securitizations on a servicing released, non recourse basis; although, we remain liable for certain limited industry standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. We recognize revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished. We believe this is a critical accounting policy due to the significant judgment involved in estimating the fair values of loans held for sale during the period between when the loans are originated and the time the loans are sold and because of its significance to our Rialto segment.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.We are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business. Our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, loans held for sale, loans held for investment and outstanding variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, such as our senior notes, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. For variable rate debt such as our unsecured revolving credit facility and Lennar Financial Services and RMFs warehouse repurchase facilities, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the outstanding borrowings on the debt facilities, but do affect our earnings and cash flows. 63Table of ContentsIn our Lennar Financial Services operations, we utilize mortgage backed securities forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of rate locked commitments and loans held for sale from fluctuations in mortgage related interest rates.To mitigate interest risk associated with RMFs loans held for sale, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to risk from the time a borrower locks a loan until the time the loan is securitized. We hedge our interest rate exposure through entering into interest rate swap futures. We also manage a portion of our credit exposure by buying protection within the CMBX and CDX markets.We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.The table below provides information at November 30, 2018 about our significant instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SHIPPING Tropical Shipping is a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean, a region which has historically been characterized by modest market growth and intense competition. The company is a major carrier of exports from the east coast of the United States and Canada to these regions. The companys shipments consist primarily of southbound cargo such as building materials, food and other necessities for developers, manufacturers and residents in the Caribbean and the Bahamas, as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts, and on cruise ships. The balance of Tropical Shippings cargo consists primarily of interisland shipments and northbound ship ments of apparel and agricultural products. Other related services such as inland transportation and cargo insurance are also provided by Tropical Shipping or other Nicor subsidiaries. 5 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Tropical Shippings operating fleet consisted of 11 owned vessels and 3 chartered vessels with a container capacity totaling approximately 4,970 TEUs. In addition to the vessels, the company owns and or leases containers, container handling equipment, chassis and other equipment. Real property, more than half of which is leased, includes office buildings, cargo handling facilities and warehouses located in the United States, Canada and some of the ports served. Additional information about Tropical Shippings business is presented in Item 1A Risk Factors, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER ENERGY VENTURES Nicor owns several energy related ventures, including three companies marketing energy related products and services and a wholesale natural gas marketing company. Nicor is also developing natural gas storage facilities and owns an interest in an interstate natural gas pipeline. Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy are businesses that provide energy related products and services to retail markets, including residential and small commercial customers. Nicor Services operates primarily in northern Illinois and provides warranty and maintenance contracts, as well as repair and installation services of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment, and customer move connection services for utilities. In conjunction with national expansion efforts, Nicor Services began doing business under the Nicor National brand in 2009. Nicor Solutions offers its residential and small commercial customers, primarily in the Nicor Gas service territory, energy related products that provide for natural gas price stability and management of their utili ty bill. These products mitigate and or eliminate the risks to customers of colder than normal weather and or changes in natural gas prices. Nicor Advanced Energy is certified by the ICC as an Alternate Gas Supplier, authorizing it to be a non utility marketer of natural gas for residential and small commercial customers. Nicor Advanced Energy presently operates in northern Illinois, offering customers an alternative to the utility as its natural gas supplier. Nicor Enerchange is a business that engages in wholesale marketing of natural gas supply services primarily in the Midwest, administers the Chicago Hub for Nicor Gas, serves commercial and industrial customers in the northern Illinois market area, and manages Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energys product risks, including the purchases of natural gas supplies. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 2012. Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawg rass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Horizon Pipeline, a 50 percent owned joint venture with NGPL, operates a natural gas pipeline of approximately 70 miles, stretching from Joliet, Illinois to near the Wisconsin/Illinois border. Nicor Gas has contracted for approximately 80 percent of Horizon Pipelines capacity under an agreement expiring in 2012 at rates that have been accepted by the FERC. EN Engineering, a previously owned joint venture between Nicor and A. Epstein & Sons International, is an engineering and consulting firm that specializes in the design, installation and maintenance of natural gas, petroleum and liquid pipeline facilities. EN Engineering provides engineering and corrosion services to Nicor Gas. Nicor sold its ownership on March 31, 2009. 6 Table of Contents Additional information about Nicors other energy ventures is presented in Item 1A Risk Factors, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CORPORATE Nicor has various equity investments, the largest of which is Triton, a cargo container leasing business. Additional information on Nicors equity investments are presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 15 Equity Investment Income, Net. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Nicor files various reports with the SEC. These reports include the annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Nicor makes all of these reports available without charge to the public on the investor section of the companys Internet site at www.nicor.com as soon as reasonably practicable after Nicor files them with, or furnishes them to, the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following factors are the most significant factors that can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of the companys businesses. New risks may emerge and management cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect the companys financial performance. The risks described below should be carefully considered in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained in this report and in Nicors other filings with the SEC, including its subsequent reports on Forms 10 Q and 8 K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks Nicor faces although they are the most significant risks. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these and other risks Nicor faces. Additionally, see the joint proxy / prospectus contained in the regi stration statement on Form S 4 filed by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. Regulation of Nicor Gas, including changes in the regulatory environment in general, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which has general regulatory power over practically all phases of the public utility business in Illinois, including rates and charges, issuance of securities, services and facilities, system of accounts, investments, safety standards, transactions with affiliated interests and other matters. Nicor Gas is permitted by the ICCs PGA regulation to adjust the charge to its sales customers on a monthly basis to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs to acquire the natural gas it delivers to them. The companys gas costs are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC for which the company makes annual filings. The annual prudence reviews for calendar years 1999 2010 are open for review and any disallowance of costs in those proceedings could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, Nicor Gas is permitted by ICC regulations to periodically adjust the charge to its customers to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs associated with environmental remediation at 7 Table of Contents former manufactured gas plant sites, franchise payments to municipalities, energy efficiency programs and, as approved in February 2010, bad debt expense. These charges are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC and any disallowance of costs by the ICC could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Most of Nicor Gas other charges are changed only through a rate case proceeding with the ICC. The charges established in a rate case proceeding are based on an approved level of operating costs and investment in utility property and are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover those costs and to earn a fair return on that investment based upon an estimated volume of annual natural gas deliveries. To the extent Nicor Gas actual costs to provide utility service are higher than the levels approved by the ICC, or its actual natural gas deliveries are less than the annual volume estimated by the ICC, Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges th rough a rate case proceeding. Nicor Gas is subject to rules and regulations pertaining to the integrity of its distribution system and environmental compliance. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by any additional laws or regulations that are enacted that require significant increases in the amount of expenditures for system integrity and environmental compliance. The ICC has other rules that impact the operations of utilities in Illinois. Changes in these rules could impact the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas enters into various service agreements with Nicor and its affiliates. Nicor Gas obtains the required ICC approvals for these agreements. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a change in law or action by the ICC, new restrictions are imposed that limit or prohibit certain service agreements between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. A change in the ICCs approved rate mechanism for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gas plant sites, or adverse decisions with respect to the prudence of costs actually incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites for which the company may in part be responsible. Management believes that any such costs that are not recoverable from other entities or from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services under an ICC approved mechanism for the recovery of prudently incurred costs. A change in this rate recovery mechanism, however, or a decision by the ICC that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An adverse decision in the proceeding concerning Nicor Gas PBR plan could result in a refund obligation which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2000, Nicor Gas instituted a PBR plan for natural gas costs. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan was terminated effective January 1, 2003. There are allegations that Nicor Gas acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC is reviewing these allegations in a pending proceeding. An adverse decision in this proceeding could result in a refund to ratepayers or other obligations which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 8 Table of Contents Nicor Gas relies on direct connections to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity. If these pipelines or storage facilities were unable to deliver natural gas for any reason it could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas meets its customers peak day, seasonal and annual gas requirements through deliveries of natural gas transported on interstate pipelines, with which it or its natural gas suppliers have contracts, and through withdrawals of natural gas from storage fields it owns or leases. Nicor Gas contracts with multiple pipelines for transportation services. If a pipeline were to fail to perform transportation or storage service, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, on a peak day or other day with high volume gas requirements, Nicor Gas ability to meet all of its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired unless or until alternative arrangements for delivery of supply were put in place. Likewise, if a storage field owned by Nicor Gas, or a principal Nicor Gas owned transmission or distribution pipeline used to deliver natural gas to the market, were to be out of service for any reason, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, this could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Fluctuations in weather, conservation, economic conditions and use of alternative fuel sources have the potential to adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. When weather conditions are milder than normal, Nicor Gas has historically delivered less natural gas, and consequently may earn less income. Nicor Gas natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating. Typically, about three quarters of the deliveries and revenues occur from October through March. Mild weather in the future could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, factors including, but not limited to, conservation, economic conditions and the use of alternative fuel sources could also result in lower customer demand. Conversely, results from products sold by Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy generally benefit from milder than normal weather. Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy offer utility bill management products that mitigate and or eliminate the risks to customers of variations in weather. Benefits or costs related to these products resulting from variances from normal weather are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. To the extent weather is colder than normal in the future, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Conservation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As a result of recent legislative and regulatory initiatives, the company has put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by its customers. Funding for such programs is being recovered through a cost recovery rider. However, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges through a rate case proceeding. Possible legislation or regulation intended to address concerns about climate change could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Future laws may mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the company and its customers in an effort to address concerns about the possible effect of those emissions on the climate. If enacted, such laws could require the company to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents Natural gas commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of the companys businesses which could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicors energy related businesses are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond Nicors control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the level of consumer demand for, and the supply of, natural gas, processing, gathering and transportation availability, the level of imports of, and the price of foreign natural gas, legislatively mandated gas supply purchase obligations, the price and availability of alternative fuel sources, weather conditions, natural disasters and political conditions or hostilities in natural gas producing regions. Any changes in natural gas prices could affect the prices Nicors energy related businesses charge, operating costs and the competitive position of products and services. In accordance with the ICCs PGA regulations, Nicor Gas adjusts its gas cost charges to sales customers on a monthly basis to account for changes in the price of natural gas. However, changes in natural gas prices can also impact certain operating and financing costs that can only be reflected in Nicor Gas charges to customers if approved by the ICC in a rate case. Increases in natural gas prices can also have an adverse effect on natural gas distribution margin because such increases can result in lower customer demand. Nicors other energy businesses are also subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management arrangements. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Nicors use of derivative instruments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor uses derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, either traded on exchanges or executed over the counter with natural gas merchants as well as financial institutions, to hedge natural gas price risk. Fluctuating natural gas prices cause earnings and financing costs of Nicor to be impacted. The use of derivative instruments that are not perfectly matched to the exposure could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Also, when Nicors derivative instruments either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Nicor is subject to margin requirements in connection with the use of derivative financial instruments and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely. Adverse decisions in lawsuits seeking a variety of damages allegedly caused by mercury spillage could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs related to its historical use of mercury in various kinds of equipment. Nicor Gas remains a defendant in several private lawsuits, all in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, seeking a variety of unquantified damages (including bodily injury and property damages) allegedly caused by mercury spillage resulting from the removal of mercury containing regulators. Potential liabilities relating to these claims have been assumed by a contractors insurer subject to certain limitations. Adverse decisions regarding these claims, if not fully covered by such insurance, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of Nicor Gas operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, Nicor Gas maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events if not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A significant decline in the market value of investments held within the pension trust maintained by Nicor Gas adversely affects the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and, over the years, has made contributions to a trust to fund future benefit obligations of the pension plan participants. A significant decline in the market value of investments held in the trust of the pension plan unfavorably impacts the benefit costs associated with the pension plan and could adversely affect Nicor Gas liquidity if additional contributions to the trust are required. These impacts, either individually or in aggregate, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of Nicors business plan and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor relies on access to both short and long term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations. Management believes that Nicor and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of Nicors control or events of default under its debt agreements may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or downgrades to Nicors credit ratings. Furthermore, Nicors ability to incur indebtedness or issue debt securities is restr icted by the covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement. Restrictions on Nicors ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in the rules and regulations of certain regulatory agencies could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shipping is subject to the International Ship and Port facility Security Code and is also subject to the United States Maritime Transportation Security Act, both of which require extensive security assessments, plans and procedures. Tropical Shipping is also subject to the regulations of both the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Surface Transportation Board, other federal agencies as well as local laws, where applicable. Additional costs that could result from changes in the rules and regulations of these regulatory agencies would adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. 11 Table of Contents Tropical Shippings business is dependent on general economic conditions. Changes or downturns in the economy could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shippings business consists primarily of the shipment of building materials, food and other necessities from the United States and Canada to developers, manufacturers and residents in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region, as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts, and on cruise ships. As a result, Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition can be significantly affected by adverse general economic conditions in the United States, Bahamas, Caribbean region and Canada. Also, a shift in buying patterns that results in such goods being sourced directly from other parts of the world, including China and India, rather than the United States and Canada, could significantly affect Tropical Shippings results of o perations, cash flows and financial condition. The occurrence of hurricanes, storms and other natural disasters in Tropical Shippings area of operations could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Tropical Shippings operations are affected by weather conditions in Florida, Canada, the Bahamas and Caribbean regions. During hurricane season in the summer and fall, Tropical Shipping may be subject to revenue loss, higher operating expenses, business interruptions, delays, and ship, equipment and facilities damage which could adversely affect Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor has credit risk that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor extends credit to its counterparties. Despite what the company believes to be prudent credit policies and the maintenance of netting arrangements, the company is exposed to the risk that it may not be able to collect amounts owed to it. If counterparties fail to perform and any collateral the company has secured is inadequate, it could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, taxes, environmental issues, billing, credit and collection matters, intersegment services, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the company to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in its financial statements, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in taxation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Various tax and fee increases may occur in locations in which the company operates. For example, the Illinois corporate income tax rate was increased effective January 1, 2011. The company cannot predict whether other legislation or regulation will be introduced, the form of any legislation or regulation, or whether any such legislation or regulation will be passed by the legislatures or other governmental bodies. New taxes or an increase in tax rates would increase tax expense and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Changes in the laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by Nicors other energy ventures could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Nicors other energy ventures provide various energy related products and services. These include sales of natural gas and utility bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment and wholesale natural gas supply services. The sale and marketing of these products and services by Nicors other energy ventures are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on, or restrict or prohibit certain activities by, Nicors other energy ventures which could adversely affect the results of ope rations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with AGL Resources The merger may not be completed, which could adversely affect Nicors business operations and stock price. To complete the merger, AGL Resources shareholders must approve the issuance of shares of AGL Resources common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the amendment to AGL Resources amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of directors that may serve on AGL Resources board of directors, and Nicor shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement. In addition, each of AGL Resources and Nicor must also make certain filings with and obtain certain other approvals and consents from various federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities. AGL Resources and Nicor have not obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the merger. Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the merger. If these approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, then neither AGL Resources nor Nicor will be obligated to complete the merger. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains other customary closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived. If AGL Resources and Nicor are unable to complete the merger, Nicor would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: Nicor would not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including increased operating efficiencies; the attention of Nicors management may have been diverted to the merger rather than to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Nicor; the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company; Nicor will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business, which may prevent it from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the merger is pending; and the trading price of Nicor common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Nicor is required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee and the reimbursement of merger related out of pocket expenses if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement. 13 Table of Contents The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on Nicors results of operations or the trading price of Nicor common stock. Nicor is subject to contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder its operations pending the merger. The Merger Agreement restricts Nicor, without AGL Resources consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent Nicor from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The value of shares of AGL Resources common stock to be received by Nicor shareholders in the merger will fluctuate. In the merger, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger (other than shares of Nicor common stock owned by AGL Resources, Nicor or any of their respective subsidiaries and shares of Nicor common stock held by Nicor shareholders who have perfected their dissenters rights) will be converted into the right to receive $21.20 in cash and 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of AGL Resources common stock and Nicor common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the completion of the merger may vary significantly from their market prices on the date of the Merger Agreement, the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and at the date of the special meeting of the shareholders of Nicor that is called to vote to approve the Merger Agreement. These variations may be the result of various factors, including, without limitation: changes in the business, operations or prospects of AGL Resources and or Nicor; speculation regarding the likelihood that the merger will be completed and the timing of the completion; general market and economic conditions; and regulatory developments and or litigation. The merger may not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the Nicor shareholder approval is received. At the time of the Nicor special meeting, Nicor shareholders will not know the exact market value of the AGL Resources common stock that will be received as a result of the merger. The actual market value of shares of AGL Resources common stock, when received by Nicor shareholders, will depend on the market value of those shares on that date. This market value may be significantly less or significantly more than the value used to determine the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the merger, as that determination was made at the time the Merger Agreement was entered into by the parties. Neither AGL Resources nor Nicor is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of a change in the market price for AGL Resources common stock or Nicor common stock. The merger is subject to receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities that could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or that could cause abandonment of the merger. To complete the merger, AGL Resources and Nicor need to obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a number of United States federal and state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities, including, among others, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the ICC and the CPUC. 14 Table of Contents While Nicor believes that they will receive the required statutory approvals and other clearances for the merger, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these approvals and clearances. If such approvals and clearances are received, they may impose terms that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which could permit AGL Resources or Nicor to terminate the Merger Agreement. A substantial delay in obtaining the required authorizations, approvals or consents or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents could prevent the consummation of the merger. Governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. The special meeting at which the Nicor shareholders will vote on the approval of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement may take place before all such approvals have been obtained and, in certain cases where they have not been obtained, before the terms of any conditions to obtain such approvals that may be imposed are known. As a result, if shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is obtained at such meeting, Nicor may make decisions after the special meeting to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further shareholder approval. Nicor will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Nicor. Although Nicor intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Nicors abilities to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Nicor to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with Nicor or not enter into new relationships or transactions. Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite Nicors retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment with Nicor because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Nicors financial results could be adversely affected. Pending shareholder suits could delay or prevent the closing of the merger or otherwise adversely impact the business and operations of Nicor. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources, one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor board of directors breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose ma terial information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources and Nicor aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain circumstances, damages. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of these lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these lawsuits or any other liabilities or costs the parties may incur in connection with the litigation or settlement of these 15 Table of Contents lawsuits. Furthermore, one of the conditions to closing the merger is that there are no injunctions issued by any court preventing the completion of the transactions. No assurance can be given that these lawsuits will not result in such an injunction being issued which could prevent or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Nicor will incur significant transaction, merger related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger. Nicor expects to incur costs associated with combining its operations with those of AGL Resources, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. These costs will be expensed as incurred. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Nicors ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, which could discourage a potential acquirer of Nicor from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Nicor to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million. Under the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted, subject to limited exceptions, from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Nicor and its subsidiaries are restricted from initiating, soliciting, seeking, inducing or intentionally encouraging or facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal with any person. Furthermore, Nicor and its subsidiaries are subject to limitations on their ability to participate in any discussions or negotiations, or to furnish any information to any person that has made an acquisition proposal with respect to Nicor or to approve, endorse or recommend any such acquisition proposal for Nicor. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential change of recommendation by the board of directors of Nicor with respect to the merger related proposals, Nicor must provide AGL Resources with five business days prior notice and, if requested, negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement prior to changing its recommendation. Nicor may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the non solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, Nicor may be required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances related to an alternative acquisition proposal. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Nicor from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the value of the merger consideration proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, Nicor may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring a potentially significant liability to AGL Resources. AGL Resources inability to obtain the financing necessary to complete the transaction could delay or prevent the completion of the merger. AGL Resources intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration with debt financing. To this end, AGL Capital Corporation (a subsidiary of AGL Resources), entered into a bridge facility pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the lenders agree to provide loans to AGL Capital Corporation in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion. AGL Resources and or AGL Capital Corporation may issue debt securities, preferred stock, common equity, or other securities, bank loans, or other debt financings in lieu of all or a portion of the drawing under the bridge facility. 16 Table of Contents Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied and the proceeds of the financing or alternative financing necessary to complete the transaction are not available, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party, so long as such party is not in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement that was a proximate cause of the financing failure. In such event, AGL Resources is required to pay Nicor a financing failure fee of $115 million. The availability of funds under the bridge facility is subject to certain conditions including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect on AGL Resources or Nicor, pro forma compliance with a consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio of 70 percent, the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve certain minimum credit ratings and the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve a certain liquidity level at closing. If AGL Resources is unable to timely obtain the financing because one of the conditions to the financing fails to be satisfied, the closing of the merger could be significantly delayed or may not occur at all. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by its financial advisor was based on the financial analyses it performed, which considered factors such as market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to it, as of the date of its opinion. As a result, this opinion does not reflect changes in events or circumstances after the date of the opinion. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by Nicors financial advisor was provided in connection with, and at the time of, the board of directors evaluation of the merger. The opinion was necessarily based on the financial analyses performed, which considered market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to the financial advisor, as of the date of its opinion, which may have changed after the date of the opinion. The opinion did not speak as of the time that the merger would be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. 17 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from 2008 to 2010 and to discuss business trends that might affect Nicor. Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii. The discussion is organized into seven sections Summary, Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, Other Matters, Outlook, Contingencies and Critical Accounting Estimates. SUMMARY Nicor is a holding company. Gas distribution is Nicors primary business. Nicors subsidiaries include Nicor Gas, one of the nations largest distributors of natural gas, and Tropical Shipping, a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. Nicor also owns several energy related ventures, including Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, which provide energy related products and services to retail markets, Nicor Enerchange, a wholesale natural gas marketing company, and Central Valley, which is developing a natural gas storage facility. Nicor also has equity interests in a cargo container leasing business, a FERC regulated natural gas pipeline, a natural gas storage development project and certain affordable housing investment s. Net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below (in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 138.4 $ 135.5 $ 119.5 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 2.98 $ 2.63 When comparing 2010 results to 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include a $1.3 million pretax reduction ($.02 per share) to the companys previously established reserve for its mercury inspection and repair program. Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect higher operating income in the companys gas distribution business, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping and other energy related businesses, lower corporate operating results, lower equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate. When comparing 2009 results to 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2008 include an unfavorable pretax mercury related reserve adjustment of $0.6 million ($.01 per share). Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect improved operating results in the companys gas distribution business and other energy related businesses and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping business, lower interest income and a higher effective income tax rate. Proposed merger with AGL Resources. In December 2010, Nicor entered into a Merger Agreement with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the second half of 2011. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the ICC. Nicor anticipates that the necessary approvals will be obtained. 23 Table of Contents In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see Nicors Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger related costs. No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger. Rate proceeding. On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent. The order also approved an energy efficiency rider. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher. On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009. Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million. Bad debt rider. In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider. This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases. It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks. As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected. The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12 month period beginning June 2011. Health Care Reform Legislation. In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform. The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012. Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs. Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense. Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the Health Care Act contains other provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits. The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations. Capital market environment. The volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments, exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity. The company continues to review its investments, exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to this past volatility. Operating income. Operating income (loss) by the companys major businesses is presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 194.7 $ 149.7 $ 124.4 Shipping 14.4 29.2 39.3 Other energy ventures 34.4 45.5 25.3 Corporate and eliminations (7.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.0 ) $ 235.7 $ 220.3 $ 185.0 The following summarizes operating income (loss) comparisons by the companys major businesses: Gas distribution operating income increased $45.0 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher gas distribution margin ($47.4 million increase), a favorable mercury related reserve adjustment ($1.3 million) and gains on property sales ($1.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.2 million increase). Gas distribution operating income increased $25.3 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin ($39.0 million increase), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.5 million increase) and operating and maintenance expense ($5.8 million increase). Shipping operating income decreased $14.8 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($7.6 million decrease) and higher operating expenses ($7.2 million increase). Operating revenues were lower due to lower volumes shipped, partially offset by higher average rates. Operating expenses were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower charter costs and lower payroll and benefit related costs. Shipping operating income decreased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($72.6 million decrease), which were partially offset by lower operating costs ($62.5 million decrease). Lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates. Operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs, charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs. Nicors other energy ventures operating income decreased $11.1 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income at Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange ($13.5 million decrease), partially offset by higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($2.3 million increase). Lower operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valu ations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services 25 Table of Contents businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($11.4 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenue ($9.1 million decrease). Nicors other energy ventures operating income increased $20.2 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange ($18.2 million increase) and at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($1.7 million increase). Higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($7.0 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenues ($5.3 million decrease). Nicor Enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. A source of commodity price risk arises as Nicor Enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale. However, gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market, whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. In addition, Nicor Enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utili ty bill management products offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. The gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided. However, the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value. For derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Corporate and eliminations operating income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was impacted by the following items: In 2010, corporate and eliminations operating income included $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of $1.3 million, $3.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather (excludes costs of approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, recorded within other energy ventures). The above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk. The amount of the offset attributable t o the utility bill management products marketed by Nicors other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year, weather patterns, the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas. In 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of $3.1 million. The legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe. The total recovery was $5.0 million, of which $3.1 million was allocated to corporate and $1.9 million was allocated to the gas distribution business (recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense). 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review. The following discussion summarizes the major items impacting Nicors operating income. Operating revenues. Operating revenues by the companys major businesses are presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Shipping 345.0 352.6 425.2 Other energy ventures 218.4 239.0 230.3 Corporate and eliminations (58.0 ) (80.3 ) (85.8 ) $ 2,709.8 $ 2,652.1 $ 3,776.6 Gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review. Gas distribution operating revenues increased $63.6 million in 2010 compared the prior year due to higher natural gas costs (approximately $110 million increase), revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $75 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $25 million decrease). Gas distribution operating revenues decreased $1,066.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs (approximately $900 million decrease), warmer weather in 2009 (approximately $140 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $60 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase). Shipping operating revenues decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($11.8 million decrease), partially offset by higher average rates ($4.2 million increase). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown. Higher average rates were attributable to higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel, partially offset by a reduction in base rates. Shipping operating revenues decreased $72.6 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($44.2 million decrease) and lower average rates ($28.4 million decrease). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown. Lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel. Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues decreased $20.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($11.5 million decrease) and Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($9.1 million decrease). Lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and ser vices businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract attributable to lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. 27 Table of Contents Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues increased $8.7 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($13.9 million increase), partially offset by lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($5.3 million decrease). Higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Lower revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against Nicor Solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products and Nicor Enerchange net revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy. Gas distribution margin. Nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues. Gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, and revenue taxes, for which Nicor Gas earns a small administrative fee. These items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues, with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense, with no direct impact on gas distribution margin. The 2009 rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs. Ad ditionally, in February 2010 the ICC approved the companys bad debt rider. As a result, changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these riders are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense. A reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution revenues $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Cost of gas (1,364.1 ) (1,345.7 ) (2,427.8 ) Revenue tax expense (145.9 ) (148.1 ) (171.1 ) Gas distribution margin $ 694.4 $ 647.0 $ 608.0 Gas distribution margin increased $47.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $8 million decrease), lower interest on customer balances ($5.5 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $4 million decrease). Gas distribution margin increased $39.0 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather (approximately $8 million decrease), lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $5 million decrease) and lower revenue from cost recovery riders (approximately $3 million decrease). Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense. Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense decreased $0.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.9 million decrease), lower pension expense ($4.6 million decrease, net of capitalization), lower billing and call center related costs ($2.9 million decrease), lower costs on legal matters ($2.6 million decrease), higher bad debt expense ($10.6 million increase) and higher costs associated with the energy efficiency program ($8.8 million increase). Bad debt expense in 2010 was $63.8 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Bad debt expense in 2010 includes the recognition of the $31.7 million benefit associated with the net under recovery of bad debt expense from 2008 and 2009; $63.0 million of expense assumed to be collected through base rates; and $32.5 million of expense which is equal to the revenue recognized under the bad debt rider. 28 Table of Contents Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased $5.8 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs ($26.5 million increase of which $21.8 million relates to higher pension expense, net of capitalization), the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs ($3.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to a 2007 investigation of the presence of PCBs in the companys distribution system and $1.9 million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe), higher postage charges ($2.0 million increase) and higher costs on legal matters ($1.8 million increase). Partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense ($17.5 million decrease due to lower revenues attribu table principally to lower natural gas costs), lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.3 million decrease) and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the 2009 rate orders ($5.7 million decrease). Other gas distribution operating expenses. In 2010 and 2008, the company recorded favorable (unfavorable) reserve adjustments of $1.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively, associated with the companys mercury inspection and repair program. Additional information about the companys mercury inspection and repair program is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity. During 2010 and 2008, Nicor Gas realized pretax gains of $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The company periodically assesses its ownership of certain real estate holdings. Shipping operating expenses. Shipping operating expenses increased $7.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher transportation related costs ($8.7 million increase, largely attributable to higher fuel prices) and higher repairs and maintenance costs ($1.9 million increase), partially offset by lower charter costs ($3.6 million decrease) and lower payroll and benefit related costs ($2.0 million decrease). Shipping operating expenses decreased $62.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower transportation related costs ($36.9 million decrease, largely attributable to lower volumes shipped and fuel prices), charter costs ($10.1 million decrease) and payroll and benefit related costs ($5.8 million decrease). Other energy ventures operating expenses. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $9.5 million in 2010 compared to prior year due to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($11.4 million decrease) attributable to lower average cost per utility bill management contract resulting from lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $11.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($7.0 million decrease) and at Nicor Enerchange ($4.3 million decrease). The decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower average costs associated with utility bill management contracts, partially offset by higher average contract volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs attributable to business growth. The decrease in operating expenses at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to lower transportat ion and storage charges attributable to lower natural gas prices. Other corporate expenses and eliminations. Other corporate operating expenses (income) were $6.8 million, $0.6 million and $(2.0) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in other corporate operating expenses for 2010 is $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2008, Nicor recorded a benefit of $3.1 million related to recoveries of previously incurred legal costs. Also included in the amounts for all years presented are certain business development costs. 29 Table of Contents Intercompany eliminations were $(57.0) million, $(76.7) million and $(79.8) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and related primarily to utility bill management products. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower interest on income tax matters ($2.9 million decrease), higher bank commitment fees ($1.7 million increase) and higher average borrowing levels ($1.1 million increase). Interest expense decreased $1.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower average interest rates ($5.3 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of higher interest on income tax matters ($1.9 million increase) and bank commitment fees ($1.5 million increase). Net equity investment income. Net equity investment income decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to the absence of a $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys 50 percent interest in EN Engineering in 2009, partially offset by an increase in income from the companys investment in Triton ($2.5 million increase). Net equity investment income increased $6.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys interest in EN Engineering, partially offset by the absence of income from the companys investment in EN Engineering ($2.8 million decrease) and a decrease in income from the companys investment in Triton ($1.1 million decrease). Equity investment results include $7.8 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for Nicors share of income from Triton. Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower interest on tax matters ($1.1 million decrease). Interest income decreased $6.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of lower average interest rates ($2.5 million decrease), interest on tax matters ($2.2 million decrease) and average investment balances ($1.5 million decrease). Income tax expense. In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations. The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization. Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $2 3 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings. At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 33.5 percent, 32.4 percent and 27.0 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies, partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments. The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

These resources include net cash flow from operating activities, access to capital markets, lines of credit and short term investments. Capital market conditions are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to access capital. Operating cash flows. The gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather, natural gas prices, the timing of collections from customers, natural gas purchasing, and storage and hedging practices. The company relies on short term borrowings, backed by bank lines of credit, to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs. Cash requirements generally increase over the last half of the year due to increases in natural gas purchases, gas in storage and accounts receivable. During the first half of the year, positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable. &#1 60;This cash is typically used to substantially reduce, or eliminate, short term debt during the first half of the year. Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions. These margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices. The company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings and investments. Net cash flow provided from operating activities decreased $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2009/2010 heating season compared to the 2008/2009 heating season and include: a decrease of $178.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and a decrease of $102.8 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. In addition, the company had higher volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Net cash flow provided from operating activities increased $598.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the increase in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2008/2009 heating season compared to the 2007/2008 heating season and include: an increase of $245.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and an increase of $238.6 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the company had lower volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 when compared to 2008. Investing activities. Net cash flow used for investing activities was $229.2 million, $211.5 million and $265.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is an internal measure utilized by management that represents cash additions to property, plant and equipment, adjusted for items including the accrual of work performed through period end and other non cash items, contributions in aid of construction and expenditures associated with asset retirement obligations. Capital expenditures by the companys major businesses are presented in the following table (in millions): Estimated 2011 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 205 $ 198 $ 203 $ 229 Shipping 26 15 22 17 Other energy ventures 129 28 6 4 $ 360 $ 241 $ 231 $ 250 Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $6 million decrease), lower facility construction (approximately $3 million decrease), lower capitalized overhead costs attributable to lower postretirement benefit costs (approximately $2 million decrease) and higher information technology improvements (approximately $8 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2009 versus 2008 due to the impact of lower customer additions (approximately $10 million decrease), information technology improvements (approximately $10 million decrease), facility construction (approximately $9 million decrease) and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $7 million decrease), partially offset by higher capitalized overhead costs attributable to higher postretirement benefit costs (approximately $9 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010. Factors contributing to the expected increase include higher expenditures associated with facility construction and new service additions and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements. Shipping capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to a decrease in progress payments on the construction of a new vessel. Shipping capital expenditures increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to progress payments on the construction of a new vessel, partially offset by a decrease in facility expansion. Shipping capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010 due primarily to increased expenditures related to freight handling equipment, containers and information technology system improvements. Other energy ventures capital expenditures increased in 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to expenditures related to the development of a natural gas storage facility by Central Valley (approximately $18 million increase). 33 Table of Contents Other energy ventures capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $120 million due to the continued development of the storage facility by Central Valley. Included in these capital expenditures is conditioning gas, to ready the field for use, that is expected to be injected in 2011 and withdrawn and sold in 2012. Additional investing activities. Yearly fluctuations in additional investing activities include the following items: 2009 and 2008 reflect increased short term investments primarily at the companys shipping business. In March 2009, the company sold its 50 percent interest in EN Engineering and received cash of $13.0 million. Financing activities. Nicor and Nicor Gas access to financing at competitive rates is, in part, dependent on its credit ratings. The current credit ratings for Nicor Inc. and Nicor Gas are as follows: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Nicor Inc. Commercial Paper A 1+ P 2 F 1 Senior Unsecured Debt AA n/a A Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a Nicor Gas Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 F 1 Senior Secured Debt AA Aa3 AA Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 A+ Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a In December 2010, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas credit ratings. S&P changed Nicor and Nicor Gas outlooks from stable to credit watch with negative implications. Moodys affirmed Nicors outlook as stable, but changed Nicor Gas outlook from stable to negative. Fitch maintained the outlook as stable for both Nicor and Nicor Gas. Both S&P and Moodys attributed the change in outlook to the proposed merger with AGL Resources. Long term debt. The company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt, for construction programs (to the extent not provided by internally generated funds) and for general corporate purposes. In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011. In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired. In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million in First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement. In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $470 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds under the terms of its indenture. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a $225 million capacity, which became effective on March 20, 2009. In 2010, Nicor entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long term fixed rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility. Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. Nicor believes it is in compliance with its debt covenants. Nicors long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. Short term debt. In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011, to replace the $550 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010. These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper. The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. &#1 60;During 2010, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $512 million to no commercial paper and averaged $269 million. During 2009, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $759 million to $216 million and averaged $417 million. The average borrowing levels are calculated using average daily balances for each day for the year. The company expects that funding from commercial paper and related backup line of credit agreements will continue to be available in the foreseeable future and sufficient to meet estimated cash requirements. Common stock. Nicor maintained its quarterly common stock dividend rate during 2010 of $0.465 per common share. The company paid dividends on its common stock of $85.1 million, $84.8 million and $84.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter. Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nicor currently has a dividend reinvestment program that offers the opportunity to holders of Nicor common and preferred shares to purchase additional shares of Nicor common stock by reinvesting the dividends and or making direct cash purchases. Shares are acquired by Nicor on behalf of participants through purchases in the open market. Nicor amended the program in 2009 to allow Nicor to issue new shares of common stock as an alternative to purchasing them in the open market. Any proceeds from newly issued shares may be used for advances to or equity investments in its subsidiaries, for other investment opportunities, or for general corporate purposes. No new shares have been issued since the program was amended in 2009. In 2001, Nicor announced a $50 million common stock repurchase program, under which Nicor may purchase its common stock as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities. There were no repurchases under this program since 2002. As of December 31, 2010, $21.5 million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock. Preferred Stock. In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends. As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share. Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption. 35 Table of Contents Off balance sheet arrangements. Nicor has certain guarantees, as further described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19 Guarantees and Indemnities. The company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual obligations. At December 31, 2010, Nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Purchase obligations $ 480.8 $ 264.8 $ 32.1 $ 5.2 $ 782.9 Long term debt 75.0 425.0 500.0 Fixed interest on long term debt 26.1 51.3 51.3 342.7 471.4 Operating leases 17.5 14.7 5.3 11.5 49.0 $ 599.4 $ 330.8 $ 88.7 $ 784.4 $ 1,803.3 In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above, Nicor has potential liabilities to taxing authorities (unrecognized tax benefits) which are dependent on the resolution of particular income tax positions. The timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with such potential liabilities is uncertain. The company had accrued a liability for estimated unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million at December 31, 2010, for which the amount and timing of payments is uncertain. The company also has long term obligations for postretirement benefits which are not included in the above table. Information regarding the companys obligations for postretirement benefits can be found in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits. Purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing businesses. Natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010. Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the other energy ventures. Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment. Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. OTHER MATTERS Storage Projects. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 20 12. The company estimates the net capital cost for the Central Valley project to be approximately $120 million. 36 Table of Contents Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawgrass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Application for Approval of Energy Efficiency Plan. On September 29, 2010, Nicor Gas filed an application with the ICC seeking approval of an energy efficiency plan. The filing was made pursuant to an Illinois law enacted in 2009 that requires local gas distribution utilities to establish plans to achieve specified energy savings goals beginning in June 2011 and provides utilities with a rider to collect the costs of the plan from customers. Under its proposed plan, the company estimates that it would bill nearly $100 million to customers under the rider, over a three year period commencing June 1, 2011, to fund the costs of various energy savings programs identified in the companys filing. Petition for Re approval of Operating Agreement. On July 1, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a petition seeking re approval from the ICC of the operating agreement that governs many inter company transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. The petition was filed pursuant to a requirement contained in the ICC order approving the companys most recent general rate increase and requested that the operating agreement be re approved without change. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding and are seeking modifications on a prospective basis to the operating agreement. Among the proposals are several by the ICC Staff and intervenors that would preclude Nicor Gas from continuing to provide certain services to support warranty produc ts that are sold by Nicor Services. Specifically, Nicor Services currently uses Nicor Gas personnel to assist in some sales solicitation for these warranty products and to provide repair services for some of these products. Nicor Gas does not believe these proposed modifications are appropriate and is opposing them. If these proposed modifications to the operating agreement are approved by the ICC, it would require changes in the way Nicor Services provides its warranty products and could adversely impact the future profitability of these products. As the ICC will be required to evaluate future transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates in connection with the joint application of AGL Resources, Nicor and Nicor Gas for approval of the merger of AGL Resources and Nicor, Nicor Gas has a motion pending with the ICC to suspend this proceeding. Financial Reform Legislation. Financial Reform Legislation was enacted into law on July 21, 2010, and includes a provision that requires certain over the counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared and also includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation will be established through rulemakings. While the company does not currently believe the legislation will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, the company will continue to evaluate the legislation and future rulemakings. Synthetic Natural Gas Plant Legislation. In January 2011, the Illinois House and Senate passed legislation regarding two proposed synthetic natural gas plants. Unless vetoed by the governor, the legislation will go into effect no later than March 15, 2011 and will require Nicor Gas and other major Illinois natural gas utilities to either: (a) submit to rate cases in 2011, 2013 and 2015, or (b) purchase under long term contracts (30 years for one plant and 10 years for the other) natural gas from the plants at a cost that may exceed the market price of natural gas. The legislation would allow Nicor Gas to recover the gas costs, and any related transportation costs, through the PGA without any further prudence review. Other. Restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to Nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the companys ability to meet its cash obligations. 37 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Nicors 2011 outlook assumes weather based on historical patterns, but excludes, among other things, the impact (including any merger and integration costs incurred in 2011) of the proposed merger with AGL Resources and the ICCs PBR plan/PGA review, other contingencies or future changes in tax law. The companys outlook also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments at Nicor Enerchange and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. While these items could materially affect 2011 earnings, they are currently not estimable. Gas distribution. Nicor Gas estimated operating results will decrease in 2011 as the result of the absence of the prior year $32 million pretax benefit attributable to the ICCs approval of the companys bad debt rider, higher operating and maintenance costs and higher depreciation expense. The company estimates that a 100 degree day variation from normal weather affects Nicor Gas distribution margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1.3 million. The consolidated impact, however, is generally reduced somewhat because of the natural weather hedge attributable to the utility bill management products offered by certain of Nicors other energy ventures. Shipping. Tropical Shippings 2011 operating results are estimated to be higher than 2010 as a result of estimated increases in base rates and cost reduction initiatives. The company also continues to expect relatively low tax costs on operating earnings in 2011 attributable to the 2006 reorganization of certain shipping and related operations. Other energy ventures. The company expects 2011 operating results from its other energy ventures to be similar to 2010s. Other. The company also expects 2011 net income to be adversely impacted by the absence of favorable tax reserve adjustments recognized in 2010 and higher state income taxes. CONTINGENCIES The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition. PBR plan. Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan is currently under ICC review. There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proce edings). As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery. The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter. In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff. The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan. The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan. 38 Table of Contents In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation. The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002. A copy of the Report is available at the Nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the ICC Proceedings. In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls. The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability. Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency. A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million. Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan. In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties. By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999 2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings. In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false. Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers. On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions. On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions. CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings. It is not possible to deter mine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings. In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan. Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT. In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007. In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007. In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively. No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter. Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder. Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Litigation relating to proposed merger. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.). The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Co ok County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 10, 2010; Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 13, 2010; Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 17, 2010; and Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al., filed December 17, 2010). The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages. On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated. Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The final disposition of these shareholder litigation related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition. Mercury. Information about mercury contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Manufactured gas plant sites. The company is conducting environmental investigations and remedial activities at former manufactured gas plant sites. Additional information about these sites is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Manufactured Gas Plant Sites. Municipal tax matters. Information about municipal tax contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Municipal Tax Matters. Other. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. See Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Other. 40 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which regularly require Nicors management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods. The application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect Nicors reported results and financial condition. The company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements. These significant policies and estimates are described throughout Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there are numerous areas in which Nicors management makes significant accounting estimates, it believes its critical estimates are those that require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments. Nicors management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors. Its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies, derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, credit risk, unbilled revenues and regulatory assets and liabilities because they are estimates which could materially impact Nicors financial statements. Loss contingencies. Nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss, including related legal defense costs, is reasonably estimable. When only a range of potential loss is estimable, the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss. Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies. These loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time, estimates may change significantly from period to period, and the companys ultimate obligations may differ materiall y from its recorded amounts. Of particular note is the PBR plan contingency at Nicor Gas described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies. Derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in managements assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules. As a result, management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedg e effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. These determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefits. The companys cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions, including life expectancies, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs. Actual experience in any one period, particularly the actual return on plan assets, often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions. When cumulatively significant, the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized into operating income over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans (approximately 9 years for the pen sion plan and 12 years for the health care plan). Additional information is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits, including plan asset investment allocation, estimated future benefit payments, general descriptions of the plans, significant assumptions, the impact of certain changes in assumptions and significant changes in estimates. 41 Table of Contents The companys postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) included in operating income was $19.6 million, $24.6 million and $2.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company expects to record postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) for 2011 of $18.7 million. Significant market declines in the values of plan assets in 2008 caused the increase in postretirement benefit expense for the years after 2008. Actuarial assumptions affecting 2011 include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent and discount rates of 5.40 percent for the companys defined benefit pension plan and 5.20 percent for the health care and other benefits plans, compared with an 8.25 percent rate of return on plan assets and discount rates of 5.45 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Nicor Gas establishes its expected long term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management. Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability based models. The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching st udy using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread. The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market. The discount rate is critical to the measurement of the plans costs. Additionally, the assumed rate of return on plan assets is critical to the determination of the pension plans cost. The following table illustrates the effect of a one percentage point change in these actuarial assumptions on 2010s net benefit cost (in millions): Actuarial assumption Increase (decrease) Effect on net benefit cost Discount rate 1.0 % $(6.2 ) (1.0 %) 7.4 Rate of return on plan assets 1.0 % (3.5 ) (1.0 %) 3.5 Income taxes. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. The evaluation is based on a two step approach. The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes between what the company recognizes as an unrecognized tax benefit and what is actually settled with the taxing authority could be materially different. Credit risk. The company is required to estimate counterparty credit risk in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments. The companys counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies and financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact the companys exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one cou nterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 42 Table of Contents However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this uncertainty, actual losses relating to credit risk could materially vary from Nicors estimates. The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments. Such estimates are based on historical experience, existing economic conditions and certain collection related patterns. Circumstances which could affect these estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, natural gas prices, customer deposits and economic conditions. Actual credit losses could vary materially from Nicors estimates. Nicors allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27.6 million, $33.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as presented on Schedule II in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The impact of credit losses to Nicors results of o perations is substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider that was approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. Unbilled revenues. Nicor Gas accrues revenues for natural gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end. Accrued unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment, including weather factors. These estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur, and variances in estimates can be material. Accrued unbilled revenues for Nicor Gas at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $141.8 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois. As a rate regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures. If Nicor Gas operations become no longe r subject to rate regulation, a write off of net regulatory liabilities would be required. Additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Accounting Policies. 43 Table of Contents CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document includes certain forward looking statements about the expectations of Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Although Nicor believes these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, planned, potential, should, will, would, project, estimate, ultimate, or similar phrases. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the companys forward looking statements due, among other things, to the outcome of the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, the direct or indirect effects of legal contingencies (including litigation) and the resolution of those issues, including the effects of an ICC review, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Specifically with respect to the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, Nicors expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are several factors many beyond the companys control that could cause results to differ significantly from its expectations. Such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that the companys business may suffer as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; the possibility that AGL Resources and Nicor will not receive the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger or that the merger will not be consummated for other reasons; the possibility of adverse decisions in pending and potential state and federal class action lawsuits, including five shareholder suits, relating to the merger; the possibility that the company may not be able to maintain relationships with its employees, suppliers, or customers as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; and the possibility that the Merger Agreement will be terminated under circumstances in which the company would incur termination payment obligations. Other factors that could cause materially different results include, but are not limited to, weather conditions; natural disasters; natural gas and other fuel prices; fair value accounting adjustments; inventory valuation; health care costs; insurance costs or recoveries; legal costs; borrowing needs; interest rates; credit conditions; economic and market conditions; accidents, leaks, equipment failures, service interruptions, environmental pollution, and other operating risks; tourism and construction in the Bahamas and Caribbean region; energy conservation; legislative and regulatory actions; tax rulings or audit results; asset sales; significant unplanned capital needs; future mercury related charges or credits; changes in accounting principles, interpr etations, methods, judgments or estimates; performance of major customers, transporters, suppliers and contractors; labor relations; and acts of terrorism. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing. Nicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations, including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates. Nicors practice is to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods, as deemed appropriate. Commodity price risk. With regard to commodity price risk, the company has established policies and procedures with respect to the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks. Company management oversees compliance with such policies and procedures. Nicors other energy businesses utilize various techniques to limit, measure and monitor market risk, including limits based on volume, dollar amounts, maturity, and in some cases value at risk (VaR). VaR is a tool to assess the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. The company has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected. The companys commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification. In accordance with SEC disclosure requirements, Nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices. Management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary. Losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the 10 percent shift used for the analyses. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is substantially mitigated because of Illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers. However, substantial changes in natural gas prices may impact Nicor Gas earnings by increasing or decreasing the cost of gas used by the company, storage related gas costs, and other operating and financing expenses. The company expects to purchase in 2011 about 2 Bcf of natural gas for its own use and to cover storage related gas costs. The volume of natural gas purchased by the company, which is exposed to market risk, has declined over the last two years as a result of certain changes approved in the 2009 rate orders. The level of natu ral gas prices may also impact customer gas consumption and therefore gas distribution margin. The actual impact of natural gas price fluctuations on Nicor Gas earnings is dependent upon several factors, including the companys hedging practices. The company generally hedges its forecasted company use and storage related gas costs through the use of swap agreements. Nicors other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from purchase and sale agreements, transportation agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management contracts. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Based on Nicors other energy businesses unhedged positions at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent adverse change in natural gas prices would have decreased Nicors earnings for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by about $0.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Nicors other energy businesses entered into derivative instruments to hedge the natural gas commodity price risk associated with its forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the Central Valley natural gas storage facility. At December 31, 2010, these derivatives totaled approximately 1.4 Bcf and had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Enerchange, Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, held derivative contracts with the following net asset (liability) fair values (in millions): Maturity Source of Fair Value Total Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years Prices actively quoted $ (8.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.6 ) Prices correlated to external sources 28.2 18.9 9.3 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (6.9 ) (5.2 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 13.0 $ 9.0 $ 4.0 Actively quoted prices are for those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX. Nicor Enerchange enters into over the counter derivative instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange traded instruments in active markets. Nicor Enerchange uses one or more significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices. Tropical Shippings objective is to substantially mitigate its exposure to higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges. Credit risk. The company has a diversified customer base, which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class and believes that it maintains prudent credit policies. Additionally, the gas distribution business offers options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. This risk has been substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expe nse included in its rates for the respective year. The company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty, customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one counterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this u ncertainty, the company has taken additional steps including, but not limited to, reducing available credit to some of its counterparties. Interest rate risk. Nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates. The company manages its interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. At December 31, 2010, if market rates were to hypothetically increase by 10 percent from Nicors weighted average floating interest rate on commercial paper, interest expense would have increased causing Nicors earnings to decrease by less than $0.1 million in 2010. Nicor holds forward starting interest rate swaps maturing in 2012 with a notional totaling $90 million. These swaps had a net liability fair value of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 . The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices that correlate to external sources. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement and then amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.

These reports include the annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Nicor makes all of these reports available without charge to the public on the investor section of the companys Internet site at www.nicor.com as soon as reasonably practicable after Nicor files them with, or furnishes them to, the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following factors are the most significant factors that can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of the companys businesses. New risks may emerge and management cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect the companys financial performance. The risks described below should be carefully considered in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained in this report and in Nicors other filings with the SEC, including its subsequent reports on Forms 10 Q and 8 K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks Nicor faces although they are the most significant risks. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these and other risks Nicor faces. Additionally, see the joint proxy / prospectus contained in the regi stration statement on Form S 4 filed by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. Regulation of Nicor Gas, including changes in the regulatory environment in general, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which has general regulatory power over practically all phases of the public utility business in Illinois, including rates and charges, issuance of securities, services and facilities, system of accounts, investments, safety standards, transactions with affiliated interests and other matters. Nicor Gas is permitted by the ICCs PGA regulation to adjust the charge to its sales customers on a monthly basis to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs to acquire the natural gas it delivers to them. The companys gas costs are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC for which the company makes annual filings. The annual prudence reviews for calendar years 1999 2010 are open for review and any disallowance of costs in those proceedings could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, Nicor Gas is permitted by ICC regulations to periodically adjust the charge to its customers to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs associated with environmental remediation at 7 Table of Contents former manufactured gas plant sites, franchise payments to municipalities, energy efficiency programs and, as approved in February 2010, bad debt expense. These charges are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC and any disallowance of costs by the ICC could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Most of Nicor Gas other charges are changed only through a rate case proceeding with the ICC. The charges established in a rate case proceeding are based on an approved level of operating costs and investment in utility property and are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover those costs and to earn a fair return on that investment based upon an estimated volume of annual natural gas deliveries. To the extent Nicor Gas actual costs to provide utility service are higher than the levels approved by the ICC, or its actual natural gas deliveries are less than the annual volume estimated by the ICC, Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges th rough a rate case proceeding. Nicor Gas is subject to rules and regulations pertaining to the integrity of its distribution system and environmental compliance. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by any additional laws or regulations that are enacted that require significant increases in the amount of expenditures for system integrity and environmental compliance. The ICC has other rules that impact the operations of utilities in Illinois. Changes in these rules could impact the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas enters into various service agreements with Nicor and its affiliates. Nicor Gas obtains the required ICC approvals for these agreements. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a change in law or action by the ICC, new restrictions are imposed that limit or prohibit certain service agreements between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. A change in the ICCs approved rate mechanism for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gas plant sites, or adverse decisions with respect to the prudence of costs actually incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites for which the company may in part be responsible. Management believes that any such costs that are not recoverable from other entities or from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services under an ICC approved mechanism for the recovery of prudently incurred costs. A change in this rate recovery mechanism, however, or a decision by the ICC that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An adverse decision in the proceeding concerning Nicor Gas PBR plan could result in a refund obligation which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2000, Nicor Gas instituted a PBR plan for natural gas costs. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan was terminated effective January 1, 2003. There are allegations that Nicor Gas acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC is reviewing these allegations in a pending proceeding. An adverse decision in this proceeding could result in a refund to ratepayers or other obligations which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 8 Table of Contents Nicor Gas relies on direct connections to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity. If these pipelines or storage facilities were unable to deliver natural gas for any reason it could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas meets its customers peak day, seasonal and annual gas requirements through deliveries of natural gas transported on interstate pipelines, with which it or its natural gas suppliers have contracts, and through withdrawals of natural gas from storage fields it owns or leases. Nicor Gas contracts with multiple pipelines for transportation services. If a pipeline were to fail to perform transportation or storage service, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, on a peak day or other day with high volume gas requirements, Nicor Gas ability to meet all of its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired unless or until alternative arrangements for delivery of supply were put in place. Likewise, if a storage field owned by Nicor Gas, or a principal Nicor Gas owned transmission or distribution pipeline used to deliver natural gas to the market, were to be out of service for any reason, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, this could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Fluctuations in weather, conservation, economic conditions and use of alternative fuel sources have the potential to adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. When weather conditions are milder than normal, Nicor Gas has historically delivered less natural gas, and consequently may earn less income. Nicor Gas natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating. Typically, about three quarters of the deliveries and revenues occur from October through March. Mild weather in the future could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, factors including, but not limited to, conservation, economic conditions and the use of alternative fuel sources could also result in lower customer demand. Conversely, results from products sold by Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy generally benefit from milder than normal weather. Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy offer utility bill management products that mitigate and or eliminate the risks to customers of variations in weather. Benefits or costs related to these products resulting from variances from normal weather are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. To the extent weather is colder than normal in the future, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Conservation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As a result of recent legislative and regulatory initiatives, the company has put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by its customers. Funding for such programs is being recovered through a cost recovery rider. However, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges through a rate case proceeding. Possible legislation or regulation intended to address concerns about climate change could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Future laws may mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the company and its customers in an effort to address concerns about the possible effect of those emissions on the climate. If enacted, such laws could require the company to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents Natural gas commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of the companys businesses which could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicors energy related businesses are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond Nicors control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the level of consumer demand for, and the supply of, natural gas, processing, gathering and transportation availability, the level of imports of, and the price of foreign natural gas, legislatively mandated gas supply purchase obligations, the price and availability of alternative fuel sources, weather conditions, natural disasters and political conditions or hostilities in natural gas producing regions. Any changes in natural gas prices could affect the prices Nicors energy related businesses charge, operating costs and the competitive position of products and services. In accordance with the ICCs PGA regulations, Nicor Gas adjusts its gas cost charges to sales customers on a monthly basis to account for changes in the price of natural gas. However, changes in natural gas prices can also impact certain operating and financing costs that can only be reflected in Nicor Gas charges to customers if approved by the ICC in a rate case. Increases in natural gas prices can also have an adverse effect on natural gas distribution margin because such increases can result in lower customer demand. Nicors other energy businesses are also subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management arrangements. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Nicors use of derivative instruments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor uses derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, either traded on exchanges or executed over the counter with natural gas merchants as well as financial institutions, to hedge natural gas price risk. Fluctuating natural gas prices cause earnings and financing costs of Nicor to be impacted. The use of derivative instruments that are not perfectly matched to the exposure could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Also, when Nicors derivative instruments either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Nicor is subject to margin requirements in connection with the use of derivative financial instruments and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely. Adverse decisions in lawsuits seeking a variety of damages allegedly caused by mercury spillage could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs related to its historical use of mercury in various kinds of equipment. Nicor Gas remains a defendant in several private lawsuits, all in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, seeking a variety of unquantified damages (including bodily injury and property damages) allegedly caused by mercury spillage resulting from the removal of mercury containing regulators. Potential liabilities relating to these claims have been assumed by a contractors insurer subject to certain limitations. Adverse decisions regarding these claims, if not fully covered by such insurance, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of Nicor Gas operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, Nicor Gas maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events if not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A significant decline in the market value of investments held within the pension trust maintained by Nicor Gas adversely affects the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and, over the years, has made contributions to a trust to fund future benefit obligations of the pension plan participants. A significant decline in the market value of investments held in the trust of the pension plan unfavorably impacts the benefit costs associated with the pension plan and could adversely affect Nicor Gas liquidity if additional contributions to the trust are required. These impacts, either individually or in aggregate, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of Nicors business plan and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor relies on access to both short and long term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations. Management believes that Nicor and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of Nicors control or events of default under its debt agreements may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or downgrades to Nicors credit ratings. Furthermore, Nicors ability to incur indebtedness or issue debt securities is restr icted by the covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement. Restrictions on Nicors ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in the rules and regulations of certain regulatory agencies could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shipping is subject to the International Ship and Port facility Security Code and is also subject to the United States Maritime Transportation Security Act, both of which require extensive security assessments, plans and procedures. Tropical Shipping is also subject to the regulations of both the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Surface Transportation Board, other federal agencies as well as local laws, where applicable. Additional costs that could result from changes in the rules and regulations of these regulatory agencies would adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. 11 Table of Contents Tropical Shippings business is dependent on general economic conditions. Changes or downturns in the economy could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shippings business consists primarily of the shipment of building materials, food and other necessities from the United States and Canada to developers, manufacturers and residents in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region, as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts, and on cruise ships. As a result, Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition can be significantly affected by adverse general economic conditions in the United States, Bahamas, Caribbean region and Canada. Also, a shift in buying patterns that results in such goods being sourced directly from other parts of the world, including China and India, rather than the United States and Canada, could significantly affect Tropical Shippings results of o perations, cash flows and financial condition. The occurrence of hurricanes, storms and other natural disasters in Tropical Shippings area of operations could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Tropical Shippings operations are affected by weather conditions in Florida, Canada, the Bahamas and Caribbean regions. During hurricane season in the summer and fall, Tropical Shipping may be subject to revenue loss, higher operating expenses, business interruptions, delays, and ship, equipment and facilities damage which could adversely affect Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor has credit risk that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor extends credit to its counterparties. Despite what the company believes to be prudent credit policies and the maintenance of netting arrangements, the company is exposed to the risk that it may not be able to collect amounts owed to it. If counterparties fail to perform and any collateral the company has secured is inadequate, it could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, taxes, environmental issues, billing, credit and collection matters, intersegment services, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the company to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in its financial statements, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in taxation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Various tax and fee increases may occur in locations in which the company operates. For example, the Illinois corporate income tax rate was increased effective January 1, 2011. The company cannot predict whether other legislation or regulation will be introduced, the form of any legislation or regulation, or whether any such legislation or regulation will be passed by the legislatures or other governmental bodies. New taxes or an increase in tax rates would increase tax expense and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Changes in the laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by Nicors other energy ventures could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Nicors other energy ventures provide various energy related products and services. These include sales of natural gas and utility bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment and wholesale natural gas supply services. The sale and marketing of these products and services by Nicors other energy ventures are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on, or restrict or prohibit certain activities by, Nicors other energy ventures which could adversely affect the results of ope rations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with AGL Resources The merger may not be completed, which could adversely affect Nicors business operations and stock price. To complete the merger, AGL Resources shareholders must approve the issuance of shares of AGL Resources common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the amendment to AGL Resources amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of directors that may serve on AGL Resources board of directors, and Nicor shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement. In addition, each of AGL Resources and Nicor must also make certain filings with and obtain certain other approvals and consents from various federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities. AGL Resources and Nicor have not obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the merger. Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the merger. If these approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, then neither AGL Resources nor Nicor will be obligated to complete the merger. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains other customary closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived. If AGL Resources and Nicor are unable to complete the merger, Nicor would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: Nicor would not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including increased operating efficiencies; the attention of Nicors management may have been diverted to the merger rather than to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Nicor; the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company; Nicor will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business, which may prevent it from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the merger is pending; and the trading price of Nicor common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Nicor is required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee and the reimbursement of merger related out of pocket expenses if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement. 13 Table of Contents The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on Nicors results of operations or the trading price of Nicor common stock. Nicor is subject to contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder its operations pending the merger. The Merger Agreement restricts Nicor, without AGL Resources consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent Nicor from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The value of shares of AGL Resources common stock to be received by Nicor shareholders in the merger will fluctuate. In the merger, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger (other than shares of Nicor common stock owned by AGL Resources, Nicor or any of their respective subsidiaries and shares of Nicor common stock held by Nicor shareholders who have perfected their dissenters rights) will be converted into the right to receive $21.20 in cash and 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of AGL Resources common stock and Nicor common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the completion of the merger may vary significantly from their market prices on the date of the Merger Agreement, the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and at the date of the special meeting of the shareholders of Nicor that is called to vote to approve the Merger Agreement. These variations may be the result of various factors, including, without limitation: changes in the business, operations or prospects of AGL Resources and or Nicor; speculation regarding the likelihood that the merger will be completed and the timing of the completion; general market and economic conditions; and regulatory developments and or litigation. The merger may not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the Nicor shareholder approval is received. At the time of the Nicor special meeting, Nicor shareholders will not know the exact market value of the AGL Resources common stock that will be received as a result of the merger. The actual market value of shares of AGL Resources common stock, when received by Nicor shareholders, will depend on the market value of those shares on that date. This market value may be significantly less or significantly more than the value used to determine the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the merger, as that determination was made at the time the Merger Agreement was entered into by the parties. Neither AGL Resources nor Nicor is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of a change in the market price for AGL Resources common stock or Nicor common stock. The merger is subject to receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities that could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or that could cause abandonment of the merger. To complete the merger, AGL Resources and Nicor need to obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a number of United States federal and state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities, including, among others, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the ICC and the CPUC. 14 Table of Contents While Nicor believes that they will receive the required statutory approvals and other clearances for the merger, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these approvals and clearances. If such approvals and clearances are received, they may impose terms that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which could permit AGL Resources or Nicor to terminate the Merger Agreement. A substantial delay in obtaining the required authorizations, approvals or consents or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents could prevent the consummation of the merger. Governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. The special meeting at which the Nicor shareholders will vote on the approval of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement may take place before all such approvals have been obtained and, in certain cases where they have not been obtained, before the terms of any conditions to obtain such approvals that may be imposed are known. As a result, if shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is obtained at such meeting, Nicor may make decisions after the special meeting to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further shareholder approval. Nicor will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Nicor. Although Nicor intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Nicors abilities to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Nicor to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with Nicor or not enter into new relationships or transactions. Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite Nicors retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment with Nicor because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Nicors financial results could be adversely affected. Pending shareholder suits could delay or prevent the closing of the merger or otherwise adversely impact the business and operations of Nicor. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources, one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor board of directors breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose ma terial information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources and Nicor aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain circumstances, damages. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of these lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these lawsuits or any other liabilities or costs the parties may incur in connection with the litigation or settlement of these 15 Table of Contents lawsuits. Furthermore, one of the conditions to closing the merger is that there are no injunctions issued by any court preventing the completion of the transactions. No assurance can be given that these lawsuits will not result in such an injunction being issued which could prevent or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Nicor will incur significant transaction, merger related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger. Nicor expects to incur costs associated with combining its operations with those of AGL Resources, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. These costs will be expensed as incurred. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Nicors ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, which could discourage a potential acquirer of Nicor from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Nicor to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million. Under the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted, subject to limited exceptions, from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Nicor and its subsidiaries are restricted from initiating, soliciting, seeking, inducing or intentionally encouraging or facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal with any person. Furthermore, Nicor and its subsidiaries are subject to limitations on their ability to participate in any discussions or negotiations, or to furnish any information to any person that has made an acquisition proposal with respect to Nicor or to approve, endorse or recommend any such acquisition proposal for Nicor. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential change of recommendation by the board of directors of Nicor with respect to the merger related proposals, Nicor must provide AGL Resources with five business days prior notice and, if requested, negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement prior to changing its recommendation. Nicor may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the non solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, Nicor may be required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances related to an alternative acquisition proposal. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Nicor from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the value of the merger consideration proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, Nicor may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring a potentially significant liability to AGL Resources. AGL Resources inability to obtain the financing necessary to complete the transaction could delay or prevent the completion of the merger. AGL Resources intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration with debt financing. To this end, AGL Capital Corporation (a subsidiary of AGL Resources), entered into a bridge facility pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the lenders agree to provide loans to AGL Capital Corporation in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion. AGL Resources and or AGL Capital Corporation may issue debt securities, preferred stock, common equity, or other securities, bank loans, or other debt financings in lieu of all or a portion of the drawing under the bridge facility. 16 Table of Contents Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied and the proceeds of the financing or alternative financing necessary to complete the transaction are not available, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party, so long as such party is not in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement that was a proximate cause of the financing failure. In such event, AGL Resources is required to pay Nicor a financing failure fee of $115 million. The availability of funds under the bridge facility is subject to certain conditions including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect on AGL Resources or Nicor, pro forma compliance with a consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio of 70 percent, the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve certain minimum credit ratings and the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve a certain liquidity level at closing. If AGL Resources is unable to timely obtain the financing because one of the conditions to the financing fails to be satisfied, the closing of the merger could be significantly delayed or may not occur at all. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by its financial advisor was based on the financial analyses it performed, which considered factors such as market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to it, as of the date of its opinion. As a result, this opinion does not reflect changes in events or circumstances after the date of the opinion. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by Nicors financial advisor was provided in connection with, and at the time of, the board of directors evaluation of the merger. The opinion was necessarily based on the financial analyses performed, which considered market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to the financial advisor, as of the date of its opinion, which may have changed after the date of the opinion. The opinion did not speak as of the time that the merger would be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. 17 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Information concerning Nicor and its major subsidiaries properties is included in Item 1 Business, and is incorporated herein by reference. These properties are suitable, adequate and utilized in the companys operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Illinois Attorney General Subpoena. On February 8, 2010, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Illinois (IOAG) issued a subpoena to Nicor to provide documents in connection with an IOAG investigation pursuant to the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act. On November 30, 2010, the IOAG issued Nicor an amended request for information. According to the subpoena, the IOAG investigation relates to billing practices used with certain customer accounts involving government funds. While the company believes its billing practices comply with ICC requirements, the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estima te its potential exposure, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this matter.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from 2008 to 2010 and to discuss business trends that might affect Nicor. Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii. The discussion is organized into seven sections Summary, Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, Other Matters, Outlook, Contingencies and Critical Accounting Estimates. SUMMARY Nicor is a holding company. Gas distribution is Nicors primary business. Nicors subsidiaries include Nicor Gas, one of the nations largest distributors of natural gas, and Tropical Shipping, a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. Nicor also owns several energy related ventures, including Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, which provide energy related products and services to retail markets, Nicor Enerchange, a wholesale natural gas marketing company, and Central Valley, which is developing a natural gas storage facility. Nicor also has equity interests in a cargo container leasing business, a FERC regulated natural gas pipeline, a natural gas storage development project and certain affordable housing investment s. Net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below (in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 138.4 $ 135.5 $ 119.5 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 2.98 $ 2.63 When comparing 2010 results to 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include a $1.3 million pretax reduction ($.02 per share) to the companys previously established reserve for its mercury inspection and repair program. Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect higher operating income in the companys gas distribution business, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping and other energy related businesses, lower corporate operating results, lower equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate. When comparing 2009 results to 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2008 include an unfavorable pretax mercury related reserve adjustment of $0.6 million ($.01 per share). Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect improved operating results in the companys gas distribution business and other energy related businesses and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping business, lower interest income and a higher effective income tax rate. Proposed merger with AGL Resources. In December 2010, Nicor entered into a Merger Agreement with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the second half of 2011. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the ICC. Nicor anticipates that the necessary approvals will be obtained. 23 Table of Contents In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see Nicors Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger related costs. No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger. Rate proceeding. On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent. The order also approved an energy efficiency rider. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher. On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009. Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million. Bad debt rider. In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider. This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases. It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks. As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected. The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12 month period beginning June 2011. Health Care Reform Legislation. In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform. The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012. Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs. Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense. Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the Health Care Act contains other provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits. The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations. Capital market environment. The volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments, exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity. The company continues to review its investments, exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to this past volatility. Operating income. Operating income (loss) by the companys major businesses is presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 194.7 $ 149.7 $ 124.4 Shipping 14.4 29.2 39.3 Other energy ventures 34.4 45.5 25.3 Corporate and eliminations (7.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.0 ) $ 235.7 $ 220.3 $ 185.0 The following summarizes operating income (loss) comparisons by the companys major businesses: Gas distribution operating income increased $45.0 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher gas distribution margin ($47.4 million increase), a favorable mercury related reserve adjustment ($1.3 million) and gains on property sales ($1.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.2 million increase). Gas distribution operating income increased $25.3 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin ($39.0 million increase), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.5 million increase) and operating and maintenance expense ($5.8 million increase). Shipping operating income decreased $14.8 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($7.6 million decrease) and higher operating expenses ($7.2 million increase). Operating revenues were lower due to lower volumes shipped, partially offset by higher average rates. Operating expenses were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower charter costs and lower payroll and benefit related costs. Shipping operating income decreased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($72.6 million decrease), which were partially offset by lower operating costs ($62.5 million decrease). Lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates. Operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs, charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs. Nicors other energy ventures operating income decreased $11.1 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income at Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange ($13.5 million decrease), partially offset by higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($2.3 million increase). Lower operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valu ations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services 25 Table of Contents businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($11.4 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenue ($9.1 million decrease). Nicors other energy ventures operating income increased $20.2 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange ($18.2 million increase) and at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($1.7 million increase). Higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($7.0 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenues ($5.3 million decrease). Nicor Enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. A source of commodity price risk arises as Nicor Enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale. However, gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market, whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. In addition, Nicor Enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utili ty bill management products offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. The gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided. However, the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value. For derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Corporate and eliminations operating income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was impacted by the following items: In 2010, corporate and eliminations operating income included $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of $1.3 million, $3.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather (excludes costs of approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, recorded within other energy ventures). The above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk. The amount of the offset attributable t o the utility bill management products marketed by Nicors other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year, weather patterns, the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas. In 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of $3.1 million. The legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe. The total recovery was $5.0 million, of which $3.1 million was allocated to corporate and $1.9 million was allocated to the gas distribution business (recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense). 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review. The following discussion summarizes the major items impacting Nicors operating income. Operating revenues. Operating revenues by the companys major businesses are presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Shipping 345.0 352.6 425.2 Other energy ventures 218.4 239.0 230.3 Corporate and eliminations (58.0 ) (80.3 ) (85.8 ) $ 2,709.8 $ 2,652.1 $ 3,776.6 Gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review. Gas distribution operating revenues increased $63.6 million in 2010 compared the prior year due to higher natural gas costs (approximately $110 million increase), revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $75 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $25 million decrease). Gas distribution operating revenues decreased $1,066.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs (approximately $900 million decrease), warmer weather in 2009 (approximately $140 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $60 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase). Shipping operating revenues decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($11.8 million decrease), partially offset by higher average rates ($4.2 million increase). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown. Higher average rates were attributable to higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel, partially offset by a reduction in base rates. Shipping operating revenues decreased $72.6 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($44.2 million decrease) and lower average rates ($28.4 million decrease). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown. Lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel. Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues decreased $20.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($11.5 million decrease) and Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($9.1 million decrease). Lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and ser vices businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract attributable to lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. 27 Table of Contents Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues increased $8.7 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($13.9 million increase), partially offset by lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($5.3 million decrease). Higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Lower revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against Nicor Solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products and Nicor Enerchange net revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy. Gas distribution margin. Nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues. Gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, and revenue taxes, for which Nicor Gas earns a small administrative fee. These items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues, with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense, with no direct impact on gas distribution margin. The 2009 rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs. Ad ditionally, in February 2010 the ICC approved the companys bad debt rider. As a result, changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these riders are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense. A reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution revenues $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Cost of gas (1,364.1 ) (1,345.7 ) (2,427.8 ) Revenue tax expense (145.9 ) (148.1 ) (171.1 ) Gas distribution margin $ 694.4 $ 647.0 $ 608.0 Gas distribution margin increased $47.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $8 million decrease), lower interest on customer balances ($5.5 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $4 million decrease). Gas distribution margin increased $39.0 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather (approximately $8 million decrease), lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $5 million decrease) and lower revenue from cost recovery riders (approximately $3 million decrease). Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense. Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense decreased $0.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.9 million decrease), lower pension expense ($4.6 million decrease, net of capitalization), lower billing and call center related costs ($2.9 million decrease), lower costs on legal matters ($2.6 million decrease), higher bad debt expense ($10.6 million increase) and higher costs associated with the energy efficiency program ($8.8 million increase). Bad debt expense in 2010 was $63.8 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Bad debt expense in 2010 includes the recognition of the $31.7 million benefit associated with the net under recovery of bad debt expense from 2008 and 2009; $63.0 million of expense assumed to be collected through base rates; and $32.5 million of expense which is equal to the revenue recognized under the bad debt rider. 28 Table of Contents Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased $5.8 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs ($26.5 million increase of which $21.8 million relates to higher pension expense, net of capitalization), the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs ($3.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to a 2007 investigation of the presence of PCBs in the companys distribution system and $1.9 million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe), higher postage charges ($2.0 million increase) and higher costs on legal matters ($1.8 million increase). Partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense ($17.5 million decrease due to lower revenues attribu table principally to lower natural gas costs), lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.3 million decrease) and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the 2009 rate orders ($5.7 million decrease). Other gas distribution operating expenses. In 2010 and 2008, the company recorded favorable (unfavorable) reserve adjustments of $1.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively, associated with the companys mercury inspection and repair program. Additional information about the companys mercury inspection and repair program is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity. During 2010 and 2008, Nicor Gas realized pretax gains of $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The company periodically assesses its ownership of certain real estate holdings. Shipping operating expenses. Shipping operating expenses increased $7.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher transportation related costs ($8.7 million increase, largely attributable to higher fuel prices) and higher repairs and maintenance costs ($1.9 million increase), partially offset by lower charter costs ($3.6 million decrease) and lower payroll and benefit related costs ($2.0 million decrease). Shipping operating expenses decreased $62.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower transportation related costs ($36.9 million decrease, largely attributable to lower volumes shipped and fuel prices), charter costs ($10.1 million decrease) and payroll and benefit related costs ($5.8 million decrease). Other energy ventures operating expenses. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $9.5 million in 2010 compared to prior year due to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($11.4 million decrease) attributable to lower average cost per utility bill management contract resulting from lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $11.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($7.0 million decrease) and at Nicor Enerchange ($4.3 million decrease). The decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower average costs associated with utility bill management contracts, partially offset by higher average contract volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs attributable to business growth. The decrease in operating expenses at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to lower transportat ion and storage charges attributable to lower natural gas prices. Other corporate expenses and eliminations. Other corporate operating expenses (income) were $6.8 million, $0.6 million and $(2.0) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in other corporate operating expenses for 2010 is $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2008, Nicor recorded a benefit of $3.1 million related to recoveries of previously incurred legal costs. Also included in the amounts for all years presented are certain business development costs. 29 Table of Contents Intercompany eliminations were $(57.0) million, $(76.7) million and $(79.8) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and related primarily to utility bill management products. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower interest on income tax matters ($2.9 million decrease), higher bank commitment fees ($1.7 million increase) and higher average borrowing levels ($1.1 million increase). Interest expense decreased $1.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower average interest rates ($5.3 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of higher interest on income tax matters ($1.9 million increase) and bank commitment fees ($1.5 million increase). Net equity investment income. Net equity investment income decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to the absence of a $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys 50 percent interest in EN Engineering in 2009, partially offset by an increase in income from the companys investment in Triton ($2.5 million increase). Net equity investment income increased $6.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys interest in EN Engineering, partially offset by the absence of income from the companys investment in EN Engineering ($2.8 million decrease) and a decrease in income from the companys investment in Triton ($1.1 million decrease). Equity investment results include $7.8 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for Nicors share of income from Triton. Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower interest on tax matters ($1.1 million decrease). Interest income decreased $6.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of lower average interest rates ($2.5 million decrease), interest on tax matters ($2.2 million decrease) and average investment balances ($1.5 million decrease). Income tax expense. In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations. The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization. Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $2 3 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings. At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 33.5 percent, 32.4 percent and 27.0 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies, partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments. The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

These resources include net cash flow from operating activities, access to capital markets, lines of credit and short term investments. Capital market conditions are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to access capital. Operating cash flows. The gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather, natural gas prices, the timing of collections from customers, natural gas purchasing, and storage and hedging practices. The company relies on short term borrowings, backed by bank lines of credit, to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs. Cash requirements generally increase over the last half of the year due to increases in natural gas purchases, gas in storage and accounts receivable. During the first half of the year, positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable. &#1 60;This cash is typically used to substantially reduce, or eliminate, short term debt during the first half of the year. Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions. These margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices. The company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings and investments. Net cash flow provided from operating activities decreased $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2009/2010 heating season compared to the 2008/2009 heating season and include: a decrease of $178.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and a decrease of $102.8 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. In addition, the company had higher volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Net cash flow provided from operating activities increased $598.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the increase in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2008/2009 heating season compared to the 2007/2008 heating season and include: an increase of $245.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and an increase of $238.6 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the company had lower volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 when compared to 2008. Investing activities. Net cash flow used for investing activities was $229.2 million, $211.5 million and $265.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is an internal measure utilized by management that represents cash additions to property, plant and equipment, adjusted for items including the accrual of work performed through period end and other non cash items, contributions in aid of construction and expenditures associated with asset retirement obligations. Capital expenditures by the companys major businesses are presented in the following table (in millions): Estimated 2011 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 205 $ 198 $ 203 $ 229 Shipping 26 15 22 17 Other energy ventures 129 28 6 4 $ 360 $ 241 $ 231 $ 250 Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $6 million decrease), lower facility construction (approximately $3 million decrease), lower capitalized overhead costs attributable to lower postretirement benefit costs (approximately $2 million decrease) and higher information technology improvements (approximately $8 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2009 versus 2008 due to the impact of lower customer additions (approximately $10 million decrease), information technology improvements (approximately $10 million decrease), facility construction (approximately $9 million decrease) and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $7 million decrease), partially offset by higher capitalized overhead costs attributable to higher postretirement benefit costs (approximately $9 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010. Factors contributing to the expected increase include higher expenditures associated with facility construction and new service additions and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements. Shipping capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to a decrease in progress payments on the construction of a new vessel. Shipping capital expenditures increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to progress payments on the construction of a new vessel, partially offset by a decrease in facility expansion. Shipping capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010 due primarily to increased expenditures related to freight handling equipment, containers and information technology system improvements. Other energy ventures capital expenditures increased in 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to expenditures related to the development of a natural gas storage facility by Central Valley (approximately $18 million increase). 33 Table of Contents Other energy ventures capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $120 million due to the continued development of the storage facility by Central Valley. Included in these capital expenditures is conditioning gas, to ready the field for use, that is expected to be injected in 2011 and withdrawn and sold in 2012. Additional investing activities. Yearly fluctuations in additional investing activities include the following items: 2009 and 2008 reflect increased short term investments primarily at the companys shipping business. In March 2009, the company sold its 50 percent interest in EN Engineering and received cash of $13.0 million. Financing activities. Nicor and Nicor Gas access to financing at competitive rates is, in part, dependent on its credit ratings. The current credit ratings for Nicor Inc. and Nicor Gas are as follows: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Nicor Inc. Commercial Paper A 1+ P 2 F 1 Senior Unsecured Debt AA n/a A Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a Nicor Gas Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 F 1 Senior Secured Debt AA Aa3 AA Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 A+ Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a In December 2010, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas credit ratings. S&P changed Nicor and Nicor Gas outlooks from stable to credit watch with negative implications. Moodys affirmed Nicors outlook as stable, but changed Nicor Gas outlook from stable to negative. Fitch maintained the outlook as stable for both Nicor and Nicor Gas. Both S&P and Moodys attributed the change in outlook to the proposed merger with AGL Resources. Long term debt. The company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt, for construction programs (to the extent not provided by internally generated funds) and for general corporate purposes. In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011. In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired. In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million in First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement. In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $470 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds under the terms of its indenture. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a $225 million capacity, which became effective on March 20, 2009. In 2010, Nicor entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long term fixed rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility. Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. Nicor believes it is in compliance with its debt covenants. Nicors long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. Short term debt. In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011, to replace the $550 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010. These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper. The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. &#1 60;During 2010, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $512 million to no commercial paper and averaged $269 million. During 2009, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $759 million to $216 million and averaged $417 million. The average borrowing levels are calculated using average daily balances for each day for the year. The company expects that funding from commercial paper and related backup line of credit agreements will continue to be available in the foreseeable future and sufficient to meet estimated cash requirements. Common stock. Nicor maintained its quarterly common stock dividend rate during 2010 of $0.465 per common share. The company paid dividends on its common stock of $85.1 million, $84.8 million and $84.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter. Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nicor currently has a dividend reinvestment program that offers the opportunity to holders of Nicor common and preferred shares to purchase additional shares of Nicor common stock by reinvesting the dividends and or making direct cash purchases. Shares are acquired by Nicor on behalf of participants through purchases in the open market. Nicor amended the program in 2009 to allow Nicor to issue new shares of common stock as an alternative to purchasing them in the open market. Any proceeds from newly issued shares may be used for advances to or equity investments in its subsidiaries, for other investment opportunities, or for general corporate purposes. No new shares have been issued since the program was amended in 2009. In 2001, Nicor announced a $50 million common stock repurchase program, under which Nicor may purchase its common stock as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities. There were no repurchases under this program since 2002. As of December 31, 2010, $21.5 million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock. Preferred Stock. In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends. As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share. Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption. 35 Table of Contents Off balance sheet arrangements. Nicor has certain guarantees, as further described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19 Guarantees and Indemnities. The company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual obligations. At December 31, 2010, Nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Purchase obligations $ 480.8 $ 264.8 $ 32.1 $ 5.2 $ 782.9 Long term debt 75.0 425.0 500.0 Fixed interest on long term debt 26.1 51.3 51.3 342.7 471.4 Operating leases 17.5 14.7 5.3 11.5 49.0 $ 599.4 $ 330.8 $ 88.7 $ 784.4 $ 1,803.3 In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above, Nicor has potential liabilities to taxing authorities (unrecognized tax benefits) which are dependent on the resolution of particular income tax positions. The timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with such potential liabilities is uncertain. The company had accrued a liability for estimated unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million at December 31, 2010, for which the amount and timing of payments is uncertain. The company also has long term obligations for postretirement benefits which are not included in the above table. Information regarding the companys obligations for postretirement benefits can be found in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits. Purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing businesses. Natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010. Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the other energy ventures. Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment. Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. OTHER MATTERS Storage Projects. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 20 12. The company estimates the net capital cost for the Central Valley project to be approximately $120 million. 36 Table of Contents Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawgrass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Application for Approval of Energy Efficiency Plan. On September 29, 2010, Nicor Gas filed an application with the ICC seeking approval of an energy efficiency plan. The filing was made pursuant to an Illinois law enacted in 2009 that requires local gas distribution utilities to establish plans to achieve specified energy savings goals beginning in June 2011 and provides utilities with a rider to collect the costs of the plan from customers. Under its proposed plan, the company estimates that it would bill nearly $100 million to customers under the rider, over a three year period commencing June 1, 2011, to fund the costs of various energy savings programs identified in the companys filing. Petition for Re approval of Operating Agreement. On July 1, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a petition seeking re approval from the ICC of the operating agreement that governs many inter company transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. The petition was filed pursuant to a requirement contained in the ICC order approving the companys most recent general rate increase and requested that the operating agreement be re approved without change. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding and are seeking modifications on a prospective basis to the operating agreement. Among the proposals are several by the ICC Staff and intervenors that would preclude Nicor Gas from continuing to provide certain services to support warranty produc ts that are sold by Nicor Services. Specifically, Nicor Services currently uses Nicor Gas personnel to assist in some sales solicitation for these warranty products and to provide repair services for some of these products. Nicor Gas does not believe these proposed modifications are appropriate and is opposing them. If these proposed modifications to the operating agreement are approved by the ICC, it would require changes in the way Nicor Services provides its warranty products and could adversely impact the future profitability of these products. As the ICC will be required to evaluate future transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates in connection with the joint application of AGL Resources, Nicor and Nicor Gas for approval of the merger of AGL Resources and Nicor, Nicor Gas has a motion pending with the ICC to suspend this proceeding. Financial Reform Legislation. Financial Reform Legislation was enacted into law on July 21, 2010, and includes a provision that requires certain over the counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared and also includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation will be established through rulemakings. While the company does not currently believe the legislation will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, the company will continue to evaluate the legislation and future rulemakings. Synthetic Natural Gas Plant Legislation. In January 2011, the Illinois House and Senate passed legislation regarding two proposed synthetic natural gas plants. Unless vetoed by the governor, the legislation will go into effect no later than March 15, 2011 and will require Nicor Gas and other major Illinois natural gas utilities to either: (a) submit to rate cases in 2011, 2013 and 2015, or (b) purchase under long term contracts (30 years for one plant and 10 years for the other) natural gas from the plants at a cost that may exceed the market price of natural gas. The legislation would allow Nicor Gas to recover the gas costs, and any related transportation costs, through the PGA without any further prudence review. Other. Restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to Nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the companys ability to meet its cash obligations. 37 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Nicors 2011 outlook assumes weather based on historical patterns, but excludes, among other things, the impact (including any merger and integration costs incurred in 2011) of the proposed merger with AGL Resources and the ICCs PBR plan/PGA review, other contingencies or future changes in tax law. The companys outlook also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments at Nicor Enerchange and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. While these items could materially affect 2011 earnings, they are currently not estimable. Gas distribution. Nicor Gas estimated operating results will decrease in 2011 as the result of the absence of the prior year $32 million pretax benefit attributable to the ICCs approval of the companys bad debt rider, higher operating and maintenance costs and higher depreciation expense. The company estimates that a 100 degree day variation from normal weather affects Nicor Gas distribution margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1.3 million. The consolidated impact, however, is generally reduced somewhat because of the natural weather hedge attributable to the utility bill management products offered by certain of Nicors other energy ventures. Shipping. Tropical Shippings 2011 operating results are estimated to be higher than 2010 as a result of estimated increases in base rates and cost reduction initiatives. The company also continues to expect relatively low tax costs on operating earnings in 2011 attributable to the 2006 reorganization of certain shipping and related operations. Other energy ventures. The company expects 2011 operating results from its other energy ventures to be similar to 2010s. Other. The company also expects 2011 net income to be adversely impacted by the absence of favorable tax reserve adjustments recognized in 2010 and higher state income taxes. CONTINGENCIES The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition. PBR plan. Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan is currently under ICC review. There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proce edings). As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery. The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter. In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff. The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan. The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan. 38 Table of Contents In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation. The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002. A copy of the Report is available at the Nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the ICC Proceedings. In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls. The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability. Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency. A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million. Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan. In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties. By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999 2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings. In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false. Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers. On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions. On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions. CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings. It is not possible to deter mine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings. In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan. Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT. In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007. In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007. In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively. No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter. Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder. Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Litigation relating to proposed merger. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.). The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Co ok County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 10, 2010; Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 13, 2010; Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 17, 2010; and Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al., filed December 17, 2010). The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages. On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated. Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The final disposition of these shareholder litigation related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition. Mercury.

The application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect Nicors reported results and financial condition. The company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements. These significant policies and estimates are described throughout Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there are numerous areas in which Nicors management makes significant accounting estimates, it believes its critical estimates are those that require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments. Nicors management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors. Its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies, derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, credit risk, unbilled revenues and regulatory assets and liabilities because they are estimates which could materially impact Nicors financial statements. Loss contingencies. Nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss, including related legal defense costs, is reasonably estimable. When only a range of potential loss is estimable, the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss. Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies. These loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time, estimates may change significantly from period to period, and the companys ultimate obligations may differ materiall y from its recorded amounts. Of particular note is the PBR plan contingency at Nicor Gas described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies. Derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in managements assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules. As a result, management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedg e effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. These determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefits. The companys cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions, including life expectancies, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs. Actual experience in any one period, particularly the actual return on plan assets, often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions. When cumulatively significant, the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized into operating income over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans (approximately 9 years for the pen sion plan and 12 years for the health care plan). Additional information is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits, including plan asset investment allocation, estimated future benefit payments, general descriptions of the plans, significant assumptions, the impact of certain changes in assumptions and significant changes in estimates. 41 Table of Contents The companys postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) included in operating income was $19.6 million, $24.6 million and $2.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company expects to record postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) for 2011 of $18.7 million. Significant market declines in the values of plan assets in 2008 caused the increase in postretirement benefit expense for the years after 2008. Actuarial assumptions affecting 2011 include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent and discount rates of 5.40 percent for the companys defined benefit pension plan and 5.20 percent for the health care and other benefits plans, compared with an 8.25 percent rate of return on plan assets and discount rates of 5.45 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Nicor Gas establishes its expected long term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management. Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability based models. The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching st udy using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread. The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market. The discount rate is critical to the measurement of the plans costs. Additionally, the assumed rate of return on plan assets is critical to the determination of the pension plans cost. The following table illustrates the effect of a one percentage point change in these actuarial assumptions on 2010s net benefit cost (in millions): Actuarial assumption Increase (decrease) Effect on net benefit cost Discount rate 1.0 % $(6.2 ) (1.0 %) 7.4 Rate of return on plan assets 1.0 % (3.5 ) (1.0 %) 3.5 Income taxes. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. The evaluation is based on a two step approach. The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes between what the company recognizes as an unrecognized tax benefit and what is actually settled with the taxing authority could be materially different. Credit risk. The company is required to estimate counterparty credit risk in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments. The companys counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies and financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact the companys exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one cou nterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 42 Table of Contents However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this uncertainty, actual losses relating to credit risk could materially vary from Nicors estimates. The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments. Such estimates are based on historical experience, existing economic conditions and certain collection related patterns. Circumstances which could affect these estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, natural gas prices, customer deposits and economic conditions. Actual credit losses could vary materially from Nicors estimates. Nicors allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27.6 million, $33.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as presented on Schedule II in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The impact of credit losses to Nicors results of o perations is substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider that was approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. Unbilled revenues. Nicor Gas accrues revenues for natural gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end. Accrued unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment, including weather factors. These estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur, and variances in estimates can be material. Accrued unbilled revenues for Nicor Gas at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $141.8 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois. As a rate regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures. If Nicor Gas operations become no longe r subject to rate regulation, a write off of net regulatory liabilities would be required. Additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Accounting Policies. 43 Table of Contents CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document includes certain forward looking statements about the expectations of Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Although Nicor believes these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, planned, potential, should, will, would, project, estimate, ultimate, or similar phrases. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the companys forward looking statements due, among other things, to the outcome of the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, the direct or indirect effects of legal contingencies (including litigation) and the resolution of those issues, including the effects of an ICC review, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Specifically with respect to the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, Nicors expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are several factors many beyond the companys control that could cause results to differ significantly from its expectations. Such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that the companys business may suffer as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; the possibility that AGL Resources and Nicor will not receive the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger or that the merger will not be consummated for other reasons; the possibility of adverse decisions in pending and potential state and federal class action lawsuits, including five shareholder suits, relating to the merger; the possibility that the company may not be able to maintain relationships with its employees, suppliers, or customers as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; and the possibility that the Merger Agreement will be terminated under circumstances in which the company would incur termination payment obligations. Other factors that could cause materially different results include, but are not limited to, weather conditions; natural disasters; natural gas and other fuel prices; fair value accounting adjustments; inventory valuation; health care costs; insurance costs or recoveries; legal costs; borrowing needs; interest rates; credit conditions; economic and market conditions; accidents, leaks, equipment failures, service interruptions, environmental pollution, and other operating risks; tourism and construction in the Bahamas and Caribbean region; energy conservation; legislative and regulatory actions; tax rulings or audit results; asset sales; significant unplanned capital needs; future mercury related charges or credits; changes in accounting principles, interpr etations, methods, judgments or estimates; performance of major customers, transporters, suppliers and contractors; labor relations; and acts of terrorism. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing. Nicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations, including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates. Nicors practice is to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods, as deemed appropriate. Commodity price risk. With regard to commodity price risk, the company has established policies and procedures with respect to the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks. Company management oversees compliance with such policies and procedures. Nicors other energy businesses utilize various techniques to limit, measure and monitor market risk, including limits based on volume, dollar amounts, maturity, and in some cases value at risk (VaR). VaR is a tool to assess the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. The company has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected. The companys commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification. In accordance with SEC disclosure requirements, Nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices. Management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary. Losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the 10 percent shift used for the analyses. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is substantially mitigated because of Illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers. However, substantial changes in natural gas prices may impact Nicor Gas earnings by increasing or decreasing the cost of gas used by the company, storage related gas costs, and other operating and financing expenses. The company expects to purchase in 2011 about 2 Bcf of natural gas for its own use and to cover storage related gas costs. The volume of natural gas purchased by the company, which is exposed to market risk, has declined over the last two years as a result of certain changes approved in the 2009 rate orders. The level of natu ral gas prices may also impact customer gas consumption and therefore gas distribution margin. The actual impact of natural gas price fluctuations on Nicor Gas earnings is dependent upon several factors, including the companys hedging practices. The company generally hedges its forecasted company use and storage related gas costs through the use of swap agreements. Nicors other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from purchase and sale agreements, transportation agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management contracts. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Based on Nicors other energy businesses unhedged positions at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent adverse change in natural gas prices would have decreased Nicors earnings for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by about $0.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Nicors other energy businesses entered into derivative instruments to hedge the natural gas commodity price risk associated with its forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the Central Valley natural gas storage facility. At December 31, 2010, these derivatives totaled approximately 1.4 Bcf and had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Enerchange, Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, held derivative contracts with the following net asset (liability) fair values (in millions): Maturity Source of Fair Value Total Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years Prices actively quoted $ (8.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.6 ) Prices correlated to external sources 28.2 18.9 9.3 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (6.9 ) (5.2 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 13.0 $ 9.0 $ 4.0 Actively quoted prices are for those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX. Nicor Enerchange enters into over the counter derivative instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange traded instruments in active markets. Nicor Enerchange uses one or more significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices. Tropical Shippings objective is to substantially mitigate its exposure to higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges. Credit risk. The company has a diversified customer base, which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class and believes that it maintains prudent credit policies. Additionally, the gas distribution business offers options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. This risk has been substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expe nse included in its rates for the respective year. The company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty, customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one counterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this u ncertainty, the company has taken additional steps including, but not limited to, reducing available credit to some of its counterparties. Interest rate risk. Nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates. The company manages its interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. At December 31, 2010, if market rates were to hypothetically increase by 10 percent from Nicors weighted average floating interest rate on commercial paper, interest expense would have increased causing Nicors earnings to decrease by less than $0.1 million in 2010. Nicor holds forward starting interest rate swaps maturing in 2012 with a notional totaling $90 million. These swaps had a net liability fair value of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 . The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices that correlate to external sources. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement and then amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.

Additionally, see the joint proxy / prospectus contained in the regi stration statement on Form S 4 filed by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. Regulation of Nicor Gas, including changes in the regulatory environment in general, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which has general regulatory power over practically all phases of the public utility business in Illinois, including rates and charges, issuance of securities, services and facilities, system of accounts, investments, safety standards, transactions with affiliated interests and other matters. Nicor Gas is permitted by the ICCs PGA regulation to adjust the charge to its sales customers on a monthly basis to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs to acquire the natural gas it delivers to them. The companys gas costs are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC for which the company makes annual filings. The annual prudence reviews for calendar years 1999 2010 are open for review and any disallowance of costs in those proceedings could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, Nicor Gas is permitted by ICC regulations to periodically adjust the charge to its customers to recover the companys prudently incurred actual costs associated with environmental remediation at 7 Table of Contents former manufactured gas plant sites, franchise payments to municipalities, energy efficiency programs and, as approved in February 2010, bad debt expense. These charges are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the ICC and any disallowance of costs by the ICC could adversely affect Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Most of Nicor Gas other charges are changed only through a rate case proceeding with the ICC. The charges established in a rate case proceeding are based on an approved level of operating costs and investment in utility property and are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover those costs and to earn a fair return on that investment based upon an estimated volume of annual natural gas deliveries. To the extent Nicor Gas actual costs to provide utility service are higher than the levels approved by the ICC, or its actual natural gas deliveries are less than the annual volume estimated by the ICC, Nicor Gas results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges th rough a rate case proceeding. Nicor Gas is subject to rules and regulations pertaining to the integrity of its distribution system and environmental compliance. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by any additional laws or regulations that are enacted that require significant increases in the amount of expenditures for system integrity and environmental compliance. The ICC has other rules that impact the operations of utilities in Illinois. Changes in these rules could impact the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas enters into various service agreements with Nicor and its affiliates. Nicor Gas obtains the required ICC approvals for these agreements. The companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a change in law or action by the ICC, new restrictions are imposed that limit or prohibit certain service agreements between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. A change in the ICCs approved rate mechanism for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gas plant sites, or adverse decisions with respect to the prudence of costs actually incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites for which the company may in part be responsible. Management believes that any such costs that are not recoverable from other entities or from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services under an ICC approved mechanism for the recovery of prudently incurred costs. A change in this rate recovery mechanism, however, or a decision by the ICC that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An adverse decision in the proceeding concerning Nicor Gas PBR plan could result in a refund obligation which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2000, Nicor Gas instituted a PBR plan for natural gas costs. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan was terminated effective January 1, 2003. There are allegations that Nicor Gas acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC is reviewing these allegations in a pending proceeding. An adverse decision in this proceeding could result in a refund to ratepayers or other obligations which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 8 Table of Contents Nicor Gas relies on direct connections to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity. If these pipelines or storage facilities were unable to deliver natural gas for any reason it could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas meets its customers peak day, seasonal and annual gas requirements through deliveries of natural gas transported on interstate pipelines, with which it or its natural gas suppliers have contracts, and through withdrawals of natural gas from storage fields it owns or leases. Nicor Gas contracts with multiple pipelines for transportation services. If a pipeline were to fail to perform transportation or storage service, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, on a peak day or other day with high volume gas requirements, Nicor Gas ability to meet all of its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired unless or until alternative arrangements for delivery of supply were put in place. Likewise, if a storage field owned by Nicor Gas, or a principal Nicor Gas owned transmission or distribution pipeline used to deliver natural gas to the market, were to be out of service for any reason, including as a result of war, acts or threats of terrorism, mechanical problems or natural disaster, this could impair Nicor Gas ability to meet its customers full requirements which could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Fluctuations in weather, conservation, economic conditions and use of alternative fuel sources have the potential to adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. When weather conditions are milder than normal, Nicor Gas has historically delivered less natural gas, and consequently may earn less income. Nicor Gas natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating. Typically, about three quarters of the deliveries and revenues occur from October through March. Mild weather in the future could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, factors including, but not limited to, conservation, economic conditions and the use of alternative fuel sources could also result in lower customer demand. Conversely, results from products sold by Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy generally benefit from milder than normal weather. Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy offer utility bill management products that mitigate and or eliminate the risks to customers of variations in weather. Benefits or costs related to these products resulting from variances from normal weather are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. To the extent weather is colder than normal in the future, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Conservation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As a result of recent legislative and regulatory initiatives, the company has put into place programs to promote additional energy efficiency by its customers. Funding for such programs is being recovered through a cost recovery rider. However, the adverse impact of lower deliveries and resulting reduced margin could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition until such time as it files for and obtains ICC approval for new charges through a rate case proceeding. Possible legislation or regulation intended to address concerns about climate change could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Future laws may mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the company and its customers in an effort to address concerns about the possible effect of those emissions on the climate. If enacted, such laws could require the company to reduce emissions and to incur compliance costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents Natural gas commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of the companys businesses which could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicors energy related businesses are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond Nicors control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the level of consumer demand for, and the supply of, natural gas, processing, gathering and transportation availability, the level of imports of, and the price of foreign natural gas, legislatively mandated gas supply purchase obligations, the price and availability of alternative fuel sources, weather conditions, natural disasters and political conditions or hostilities in natural gas producing regions. Any changes in natural gas prices could affect the prices Nicors energy related businesses charge, operating costs and the competitive position of products and services. In accordance with the ICCs PGA regulations, Nicor Gas adjusts its gas cost charges to sales customers on a monthly basis to account for changes in the price of natural gas. However, changes in natural gas prices can also impact certain operating and financing costs that can only be reflected in Nicor Gas charges to customers if approved by the ICC in a rate case. Increases in natural gas prices can also have an adverse effect on natural gas distribution margin because such increases can result in lower customer demand. Nicors other energy businesses are also subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management arrangements. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Nicors use of derivative instruments could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor uses derivative instruments, including futures, options, forwards and swaps, either traded on exchanges or executed over the counter with natural gas merchants as well as financial institutions, to hedge natural gas price risk. Fluctuating natural gas prices cause earnings and financing costs of Nicor to be impacted. The use of derivative instruments that are not perfectly matched to the exposure could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Also, when Nicors derivative instruments either do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Nicor is subject to margin requirements in connection with the use of derivative financial instruments and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely. Adverse decisions in lawsuits seeking a variety of damages allegedly caused by mercury spillage could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs related to its historical use of mercury in various kinds of equipment. Nicor Gas remains a defendant in several private lawsuits, all in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, seeking a variety of unquantified damages (including bodily injury and property damages) allegedly caused by mercury spillage resulting from the removal of mercury containing regulators. Potential liabilities relating to these claims have been assumed by a contractors insurer subject to certain limitations. Adverse decisions regarding these claims, if not fully covered by such insurance, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of Nicor Gas operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, Nicor Gas maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events if not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A significant decline in the market value of investments held within the pension trust maintained by Nicor Gas adversely affects the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor Gas sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and, over the years, has made contributions to a trust to fund future benefit obligations of the pension plan participants. A significant decline in the market value of investments held in the trust of the pension plan unfavorably impacts the benefit costs associated with the pension plan and could adversely affect Nicor Gas liquidity if additional contributions to the trust are required. These impacts, either individually or in aggregate, may adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. An inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of Nicors business plan and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor relies on access to both short and long term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations. Management believes that Nicor and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain disruptions outside of Nicors control or events of default under its debt agreements may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or downgrades to Nicors credit ratings. Furthermore, Nicors ability to incur indebtedness or issue debt securities is restr icted by the covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement. Restrictions on Nicors ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in the rules and regulations of certain regulatory agencies could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shipping is subject to the International Ship and Port facility Security Code and is also subject to the United States Maritime Transportation Security Act, both of which require extensive security assessments, plans and procedures. Tropical Shipping is also subject to the regulations of both the Federal Maritime Commission, and the Surface Transportation Board, other federal agencies as well as local laws, where applicable. Additional costs that could result from changes in the rules and regulations of these regulatory agencies would adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. 11 Table of Contents Tropical Shippings business is dependent on general economic conditions. Changes or downturns in the economy could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Tropical Shipping. Tropical Shippings business consists primarily of the shipment of building materials, food and other necessities from the United States and Canada to developers, manufacturers and residents in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region, as well as tourist related shipments intended for use in hotels and resorts, and on cruise ships. As a result, Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition can be significantly affected by adverse general economic conditions in the United States, Bahamas, Caribbean region and Canada. Also, a shift in buying patterns that results in such goods being sourced directly from other parts of the world, including China and India, rather than the United States and Canada, could significantly affect Tropical Shippings results of o perations, cash flows and financial condition. The occurrence of hurricanes, storms and other natural disasters in Tropical Shippings area of operations could adversely affect its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Tropical Shippings operations are affected by weather conditions in Florida, Canada, the Bahamas and Caribbean regions. During hurricane season in the summer and fall, Tropical Shipping may be subject to revenue loss, higher operating expenses, business interruptions, delays, and ship, equipment and facilities damage which could adversely affect Tropical Shippings results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor has credit risk that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Nicor extends credit to its counterparties. Despite what the company believes to be prudent credit policies and the maintenance of netting arrangements, the company is exposed to the risk that it may not be able to collect amounts owed to it. If counterparties fail to perform and any collateral the company has secured is inadequate, it could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, taxes, environmental issues, billing, credit and collection matters, intersegment services, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the company to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in its financial statements, could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Changes in taxation could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Various tax and fee increases may occur in locations in which the company operates. For example, the Illinois corporate income tax rate was increased effective January 1, 2011. The company cannot predict whether other legislation or regulation will be introduced, the form of any legislation or regulation, or whether any such legislation or regulation will be passed by the legislatures or other governmental bodies. New taxes or an increase in tax rates would increase tax expense and could adversely affect the companys results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 12 Table of Contents Changes in the laws and regulations regarding the sale and marketing of products and services offered by Nicors other energy ventures could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Nicors other energy ventures provide various energy related products and services. These include sales of natural gas and utility bill management services to residential and small commercial customers, the sale, repair, maintenance and warranty of heating, air conditioning and indoor air quality equipment and wholesale natural gas supply services. The sale and marketing of these products and services by Nicors other energy ventures are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations could impose additional costs on, or restrict or prohibit certain activities by, Nicors other energy ventures which could adversely affect the results of ope rations, cash flows and financial condition of Nicor. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with AGL Resources The merger may not be completed, which could adversely affect Nicors business operations and stock price. To complete the merger, AGL Resources shareholders must approve the issuance of shares of AGL Resources common stock as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the amendment to AGL Resources amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of directors that may serve on AGL Resources board of directors, and Nicor shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement. In addition, each of AGL Resources and Nicor must also make certain filings with and obtain certain other approvals and consents from various federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities. AGL Resources and Nicor have not obtained all regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the merger. Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge the merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest as a condition to approving the merger. If these approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, then neither AGL Resources nor Nicor will be obligated to complete the merger. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains other customary closing conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived. If AGL Resources and Nicor are unable to complete the merger, Nicor would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: Nicor would not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including increased operating efficiencies; the attention of Nicors management may have been diverted to the merger rather than to its own operations and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Nicor; the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company; Nicor will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business, which may prevent it from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the merger is pending; and the trading price of Nicor common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Nicor is required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee and the reimbursement of merger related out of pocket expenses if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement. 13 Table of Contents The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on Nicors results of operations or the trading price of Nicor common stock. Nicor is subject to contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement that may hinder its operations pending the merger. The Merger Agreement restricts Nicor, without AGL Resources consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent Nicor from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. The value of shares of AGL Resources common stock to be received by Nicor shareholders in the merger will fluctuate. In the merger, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding immediately prior to completion of the merger (other than shares of Nicor common stock owned by AGL Resources, Nicor or any of their respective subsidiaries and shares of Nicor common stock held by Nicor shareholders who have perfected their dissenters rights) will be converted into the right to receive $21.20 in cash and 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the completion of the merger. The market prices of AGL Resources common stock and Nicor common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the completion of the merger may vary significantly from their market prices on the date of the Merger Agreement, the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and at the date of the special meeting of the shareholders of Nicor that is called to vote to approve the Merger Agreement. These variations may be the result of various factors, including, without limitation: changes in the business, operations or prospects of AGL Resources and or Nicor; speculation regarding the likelihood that the merger will be completed and the timing of the completion; general market and economic conditions; and regulatory developments and or litigation. The merger may not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the Nicor shareholder approval is received. At the time of the Nicor special meeting, Nicor shareholders will not know the exact market value of the AGL Resources common stock that will be received as a result of the merger. The actual market value of shares of AGL Resources common stock, when received by Nicor shareholders, will depend on the market value of those shares on that date. This market value may be significantly less or significantly more than the value used to determine the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the merger, as that determination was made at the time the Merger Agreement was entered into by the parties. Neither AGL Resources nor Nicor is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of a change in the market price for AGL Resources common stock or Nicor common stock. The merger is subject to receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities that could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or that could cause abandonment of the merger. To complete the merger, AGL Resources and Nicor need to obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, a number of United States federal and state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities, including, among others, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the ICC and the CPUC. 14 Table of Contents While Nicor believes that they will receive the required statutory approvals and other clearances for the merger, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these approvals and clearances. If such approvals and clearances are received, they may impose terms that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which could permit AGL Resources or Nicor to terminate the Merger Agreement. A substantial delay in obtaining the required authorizations, approvals or consents or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents could prevent the consummation of the merger. Governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. The special meeting at which the Nicor shareholders will vote on the approval of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement may take place before all such approvals have been obtained and, in certain cases where they have not been obtained, before the terms of any conditions to obtain such approvals that may be imposed are known. As a result, if shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is obtained at such meeting, Nicor may make decisions after the special meeting to waive a condition or approve certain actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further shareholder approval. Nicor will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Nicor. Although Nicor intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair Nicors abilities to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Nicor to seek to change or terminate existing business relationships with Nicor or not enter into new relationships or transactions. Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite Nicors retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue employment with Nicor because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, Nicors financial results could be adversely affected. Pending shareholder suits could delay or prevent the closing of the merger or otherwise adversely impact the business and operations of Nicor. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources, one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor board of directors breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose ma terial information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources and Nicor aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain circumstances, damages. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of these lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these lawsuits or any other liabilities or costs the parties may incur in connection with the litigation or settlement of these 15 Table of Contents lawsuits. Furthermore, one of the conditions to closing the merger is that there are no injunctions issued by any court preventing the completion of the transactions. No assurance can be given that these lawsuits will not result in such an injunction being issued which could prevent or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Nicor will incur significant transaction, merger related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger. Nicor expects to incur costs associated with combining its operations with those of AGL Resources, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. These costs will be expensed as incurred. The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Nicors ability to pursue alternatives to the merger, which could discourage a potential acquirer of Nicor from making an alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Nicor to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million. Under the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted, subject to limited exceptions, from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Nicor and its subsidiaries are restricted from initiating, soliciting, seeking, inducing or intentionally encouraging or facilitating any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal with any person. Furthermore, Nicor and its subsidiaries are subject to limitations on their ability to participate in any discussions or negotiations, or to furnish any information to any person that has made an acquisition proposal with respect to Nicor or to approve, endorse or recommend any such acquisition proposal for Nicor. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential change of recommendation by the board of directors of Nicor with respect to the merger related proposals, Nicor must provide AGL Resources with five business days prior notice and, if requested, negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement prior to changing its recommendation. Nicor may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the non solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, Nicor may be required to pay AGL Resources a termination fee of $67 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances related to an alternative acquisition proposal. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Nicor from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the value of the merger consideration proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, Nicor may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring a potentially significant liability to AGL Resources. AGL Resources inability to obtain the financing necessary to complete the transaction could delay or prevent the completion of the merger. AGL Resources intends to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration with debt financing. To this end, AGL Capital Corporation (a subsidiary of AGL Resources), entered into a bridge facility pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the lenders agree to provide loans to AGL Capital Corporation in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion. AGL Resources and or AGL Capital Corporation may issue debt securities, preferred stock, common equity, or other securities, bank loans, or other debt financings in lieu of all or a portion of the drawing under the bridge facility. 16 Table of Contents Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied and the proceeds of the financing or alternative financing necessary to complete the transaction are not available, the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party, so long as such party is not in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement that was a proximate cause of the financing failure. In such event, AGL Resources is required to pay Nicor a financing failure fee of $115 million. The availability of funds under the bridge facility is subject to certain conditions including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect on AGL Resources or Nicor, pro forma compliance with a consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio of 70 percent, the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve certain minimum credit ratings and the ability of AGL Capital Corporation to achieve a certain liquidity level at closing. If AGL Resources is unable to timely obtain the financing because one of the conditions to the financing fails to be satisfied, the closing of the merger could be significantly delayed or may not occur at all. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by its financial advisor was based on the financial analyses it performed, which considered factors such as market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to it, as of the date of its opinion. As a result, this opinion does not reflect changes in events or circumstances after the date of the opinion. The opinion rendered to the board of directors of Nicor by Nicors financial advisor was provided in connection with, and at the time of, the board of directors evaluation of the merger. The opinion was necessarily based on the financial analyses performed, which considered market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to the financial advisor, as of the date of its opinion, which may have changed after the date of the opinion. The opinion did not speak as of the time that the merger would be completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinion. 17 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.

On February 8, 2010, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Illinois (IOAG) issued a subpoena to Nicor to provide documents in connection with an IOAG investigation pursuant to the Illinois Whistleblower Reward and Protection Act. On November 30, 2010, the IOAG issued Nicor an amended request for information. According to the subpoena, the IOAG investigation relates to billing practices used with certain customer accounts involving government funds. While the company believes its billing practices comply with ICC requirements, the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estima te its potential exposure, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this matter.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from 2008 to 2010 and to discuss business trends that might affect Nicor. Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii. The discussion is organized into seven sections Summary, Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, Other Matters, Outlook, Contingencies and Critical Accounting Estimates. SUMMARY Nicor is a holding company. Gas distribution is Nicors primary business. Nicors subsidiaries include Nicor Gas, one of the nations largest distributors of natural gas, and Tropical Shipping, a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. Nicor also owns several energy related ventures, including Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, which provide energy related products and services to retail markets, Nicor Enerchange, a wholesale natural gas marketing company, and Central Valley, which is developing a natural gas storage facility. Nicor also has equity interests in a cargo container leasing business, a FERC regulated natural gas pipeline, a natural gas storage development project and certain affordable housing investment s. Net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below (in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 138.4 $ 135.5 $ 119.5 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 2.98 $ 2.63 When comparing 2010 results to 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include a $1.3 million pretax reduction ($.02 per share) to the companys previously established reserve for its mercury inspection and repair program. Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect higher operating income in the companys gas distribution business, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping and other energy related businesses, lower corporate operating results, lower equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate. When comparing 2009 results to 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2008 include an unfavorable pretax mercury related reserve adjustment of $0.6 million ($.01 per share). Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect improved operating results in the companys gas distribution business and other energy related businesses and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping business, lower interest income and a higher effective income tax rate. Proposed merger with AGL Resources. In December 2010, Nicor entered into a Merger Agreement with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the second half of 2011. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the ICC. Nicor anticipates that the necessary approvals will be obtained. 23 Table of Contents In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see Nicors Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger related costs. No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger. Rate proceeding. On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent. The order also approved an energy efficiency rider. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher. On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009. Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million. Bad debt rider. In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider. This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases. It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks. As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected. The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12 month period beginning June 2011. Health Care Reform Legislation. In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform. The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012. Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs. Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense. Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the Health Care Act contains other provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits. The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations. Capital market environment. The volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments, exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity. The company continues to review its investments, exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to this past volatility. Operating income. Operating income (loss) by the companys major businesses is presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 194.7 $ 149.7 $ 124.4 Shipping 14.4 29.2 39.3 Other energy ventures 34.4 45.5 25.3 Corporate and eliminations (7.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.0 ) $ 235.7 $ 220.3 $ 185.0 The following summarizes operating income (loss) comparisons by the companys major businesses: Gas distribution operating income increased $45.0 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher gas distribution margin ($47.4 million increase), a favorable mercury related reserve adjustment ($1.3 million) and gains on property sales ($1.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.2 million increase). Gas distribution operating income increased $25.3 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin ($39.0 million increase), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.5 million increase) and operating and maintenance expense ($5.8 million increase). Shipping operating income decreased $14.8 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($7.6 million decrease) and higher operating expenses ($7.2 million increase). Operating revenues were lower due to lower volumes shipped, partially offset by higher average rates. Operating expenses were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower charter costs and lower payroll and benefit related costs. Shipping operating income decreased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($72.6 million decrease), which were partially offset by lower operating costs ($62.5 million decrease). Lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates. Operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs, charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs. Nicors other energy ventures operating income decreased $11.1 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income at Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange ($13.5 million decrease), partially offset by higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($2.3 million increase). Lower operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valu ations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services 25 Table of Contents businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($11.4 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenue ($9.1 million decrease). Nicors other energy ventures operating income increased $20.2 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange ($18.2 million increase) and at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($1.7 million increase). Higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($7.0 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenues ($5.3 million decrease). Nicor Enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. A source of commodity price risk arises as Nicor Enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale. However, gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market, whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. In addition, Nicor Enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utili ty bill management products offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. The gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided. However, the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value. For derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Corporate and eliminations operating income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was impacted by the following items: In 2010, corporate and eliminations operating income included $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of $1.3 million, $3.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather (excludes costs of approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, recorded within other energy ventures). The above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk. The amount of the offset attributable t o the utility bill management products marketed by Nicors other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year, weather patterns, the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas. In 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of $3.1 million. The legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe. The total recovery was $5.0 million, of which $3.1 million was allocated to corporate and $1.9 million was allocated to the gas distribution business (recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense). 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review. The following discussion summarizes the major items impacting Nicors operating income. Operating revenues. Operating revenues by the companys major businesses are presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Shipping 345.0 352.6 425.2 Other energy ventures 218.4 239.0 230.3 Corporate and eliminations (58.0 ) (80.3 ) (85.8 ) $ 2,709.8 $ 2,652.1 $ 3,776.6 Gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review. Gas distribution operating revenues increased $63.6 million in 2010 compared the prior year due to higher natural gas costs (approximately $110 million increase), revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $75 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $25 million decrease). Gas distribution operating revenues decreased $1,066.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs (approximately $900 million decrease), warmer weather in 2009 (approximately $140 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $60 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase). Shipping operating revenues decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($11.8 million decrease), partially offset by higher average rates ($4.2 million increase). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown. Higher average rates were attributable to higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel, partially offset by a reduction in base rates. Shipping operating revenues decreased $72.6 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($44.2 million decrease) and lower average rates ($28.4 million decrease). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown. Lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel. Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues decreased $20.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($11.5 million decrease) and Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($9.1 million decrease). Lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and ser vices businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract attributable to lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. 27 Table of Contents Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues increased $8.7 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($13.9 million increase), partially offset by lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($5.3 million decrease). Higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Lower revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against Nicor Solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products and Nicor Enerchange net revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy. Gas distribution margin. Nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues. Gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, and revenue taxes, for which Nicor Gas earns a small administrative fee. These items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues, with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense, with no direct impact on gas distribution margin. The 2009 rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs. Ad ditionally, in February 2010 the ICC approved the companys bad debt rider. As a result, changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these riders are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense. A reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution revenues $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Cost of gas (1,364.1 ) (1,345.7 ) (2,427.8 ) Revenue tax expense (145.9 ) (148.1 ) (171.1 ) Gas distribution margin $ 694.4 $ 647.0 $ 608.0 Gas distribution margin increased $47.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $8 million decrease), lower interest on customer balances ($5.5 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $4 million decrease). Gas distribution margin increased $39.0 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather (approximately $8 million decrease), lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $5 million decrease) and lower revenue from cost recovery riders (approximately $3 million decrease). Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense. Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense decreased $0.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.9 million decrease), lower pension expense ($4.6 million decrease, net of capitalization), lower billing and call center related costs ($2.9 million decrease), lower costs on legal matters ($2.6 million decrease), higher bad debt expense ($10.6 million increase) and higher costs associated with the energy efficiency program ($8.8 million increase). Bad debt expense in 2010 was $63.8 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Bad debt expense in 2010 includes the recognition of the $31.7 million benefit associated with the net under recovery of bad debt expense from 2008 and 2009; $63.0 million of expense assumed to be collected through base rates; and $32.5 million of expense which is equal to the revenue recognized under the bad debt rider. 28 Table of Contents Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased $5.8 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs ($26.5 million increase of which $21.8 million relates to higher pension expense, net of capitalization), the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs ($3.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to a 2007 investigation of the presence of PCBs in the companys distribution system and $1.9 million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe), higher postage charges ($2.0 million increase) and higher costs on legal matters ($1.8 million increase). Partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense ($17.5 million decrease due to lower revenues attribu table principally to lower natural gas costs), lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.3 million decrease) and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the 2009 rate orders ($5.7 million decrease). Other gas distribution operating expenses. In 2010 and 2008, the company recorded favorable (unfavorable) reserve adjustments of $1.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively, associated with the companys mercury inspection and repair program. Additional information about the companys mercury inspection and repair program is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity. During 2010 and 2008, Nicor Gas realized pretax gains of $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The company periodically assesses its ownership of certain real estate holdings. Shipping operating expenses. Shipping operating expenses increased $7.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher transportation related costs ($8.7 million increase, largely attributable to higher fuel prices) and higher repairs and maintenance costs ($1.9 million increase), partially offset by lower charter costs ($3.6 million decrease) and lower payroll and benefit related costs ($2.0 million decrease). Shipping operating expenses decreased $62.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower transportation related costs ($36.9 million decrease, largely attributable to lower volumes shipped and fuel prices), charter costs ($10.1 million decrease) and payroll and benefit related costs ($5.8 million decrease). Other energy ventures operating expenses. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $9.5 million in 2010 compared to prior year due to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($11.4 million decrease) attributable to lower average cost per utility bill management contract resulting from lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $11.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($7.0 million decrease) and at Nicor Enerchange ($4.3 million decrease). The decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower average costs associated with utility bill management contracts, partially offset by higher average contract volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs attributable to business growth. The decrease in operating expenses at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to lower transportat ion and storage charges attributable to lower natural gas prices. Other corporate expenses and eliminations. Other corporate operating expenses (income) were $6.8 million, $0.6 million and $(2.0) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in other corporate operating expenses for 2010 is $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2008, Nicor recorded a benefit of $3.1 million related to recoveries of previously incurred legal costs. Also included in the amounts for all years presented are certain business development costs. 29 Table of Contents Intercompany eliminations were $(57.0) million, $(76.7) million and $(79.8) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and related primarily to utility bill management products. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower interest on income tax matters ($2.9 million decrease), higher bank commitment fees ($1.7 million increase) and higher average borrowing levels ($1.1 million increase). Interest expense decreased $1.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower average interest rates ($5.3 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of higher interest on income tax matters ($1.9 million increase) and bank commitment fees ($1.5 million increase). Net equity investment income. Net equity investment income decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to the absence of a $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys 50 percent interest in EN Engineering in 2009, partially offset by an increase in income from the companys investment in Triton ($2.5 million increase). Net equity investment income increased $6.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys interest in EN Engineering, partially offset by the absence of income from the companys investment in EN Engineering ($2.8 million decrease) and a decrease in income from the companys investment in Triton ($1.1 million decrease). Equity investment results include $7.8 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for Nicors share of income from Triton. Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower interest on tax matters ($1.1 million decrease). Interest income decreased $6.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of lower average interest rates ($2.5 million decrease), interest on tax matters ($2.2 million decrease) and average investment balances ($1.5 million decrease). Income tax expense. In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations. The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization. Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $2 3 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings. At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 33.5 percent, 32.4 percent and 27.0 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies, partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments. The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

These resources include net cash flow from operating activities, access to capital markets, lines of credit and short term investments. Capital market conditions are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to access capital. Operating cash flows. The gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather, natural gas prices, the timing of collections from customers, natural gas purchasing, and storage and hedging practices. The company relies on short term borrowings, backed by bank lines of credit, to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs. Cash requirements generally increase over the last half of the year due to increases in natural gas purchases, gas in storage and accounts receivable. During the first half of the year, positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable. &#1 60;This cash is typically used to substantially reduce, or eliminate, short term debt during the first half of the year. Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions. These margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices. The company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings and investments. Net cash flow provided from operating activities decreased $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2009/2010 heating season compared to the 2008/2009 heating season and include: a decrease of $178.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and a decrease of $102.8 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. In addition, the company had higher volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Net cash flow provided from operating activities increased $598.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the increase in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2008/2009 heating season compared to the 2007/2008 heating season and include: an increase of $245.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and an increase of $238.6 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the company had lower volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 when compared to 2008. Investing activities. Net cash flow used for investing activities was $229.2 million, $211.5 million and $265.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is an internal measure utilized by management that represents cash additions to property, plant and equipment, adjusted for items including the accrual of work performed through period end and other non cash items, contributions in aid of construction and expenditures associated with asset retirement obligations. Capital expenditures by the companys major businesses are presented in the following table (in millions): Estimated 2011 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 205 $ 198 $ 203 $ 229 Shipping 26 15 22 17 Other energy ventures 129 28 6 4 $ 360 $ 241 $ 231 $ 250 Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $6 million decrease), lower facility construction (approximately $3 million decrease), lower capitalized overhead costs attributable to lower postretirement benefit costs (approximately $2 million decrease) and higher information technology improvements (approximately $8 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2009 versus 2008 due to the impact of lower customer additions (approximately $10 million decrease), information technology improvements (approximately $10 million decrease), facility construction (approximately $9 million decrease) and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $7 million decrease), partially offset by higher capitalized overhead costs attributable to higher postretirement benefit costs (approximately $9 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010. Factors contributing to the expected increase include higher expenditures associated with facility construction and new service additions and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements. Shipping capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to a decrease in progress payments on the construction of a new vessel. Shipping capital expenditures increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to progress payments on the construction of a new vessel, partially offset by a decrease in facility expansion. Shipping capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010 due primarily to increased expenditures related to freight handling equipment, containers and information technology system improvements. Other energy ventures capital expenditures increased in 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to expenditures related to the development of a natural gas storage facility by Central Valley (approximately $18 million increase). 33 Table of Contents Other energy ventures capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $120 million due to the continued development of the storage facility by Central Valley. Included in these capital expenditures is conditioning gas, to ready the field for use, that is expected to be injected in 2011 and withdrawn and sold in 2012. Additional investing activities. Yearly fluctuations in additional investing activities include the following items: 2009 and 2008 reflect increased short term investments primarily at the companys shipping business. In March 2009, the company sold its 50 percent interest in EN Engineering and received cash of $13.0 million. Financing activities. Nicor and Nicor Gas access to financing at competitive rates is, in part, dependent on its credit ratings. The current credit ratings for Nicor Inc. and Nicor Gas are as follows: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Nicor Inc. Commercial Paper A 1+ P 2 F 1 Senior Unsecured Debt AA n/a A Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a Nicor Gas Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 F 1 Senior Secured Debt AA Aa3 AA Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 A+ Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a In December 2010, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas credit ratings. S&P changed Nicor and Nicor Gas outlooks from stable to credit watch with negative implications. Moodys affirmed Nicors outlook as stable, but changed Nicor Gas outlook from stable to negative. Fitch maintained the outlook as stable for both Nicor and Nicor Gas. Both S&P and Moodys attributed the change in outlook to the proposed merger with AGL Resources. Long term debt. The company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt, for construction programs (to the extent not provided by internally generated funds) and for general corporate purposes. In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011. In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired. In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million in First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement. In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $470 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds under the terms of its indenture. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a $225 million capacity, which became effective on March 20, 2009. In 2010, Nicor entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long term fixed rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility. Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. Nicor believes it is in compliance with its debt covenants. Nicors long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. Short term debt. In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011, to replace the $550 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010. These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper. The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. &#1 60;During 2010, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $512 million to no commercial paper and averaged $269 million. During 2009, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $759 million to $216 million and averaged $417 million. The average borrowing levels are calculated using average daily balances for each day for the year. The company expects that funding from commercial paper and related backup line of credit agreements will continue to be available in the foreseeable future and sufficient to meet estimated cash requirements. Common stock. Nicor maintained its quarterly common stock dividend rate during 2010 of $0.465 per common share. The company paid dividends on its common stock of $85.1 million, $84.8 million and $84.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter. Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nicor currently has a dividend reinvestment program that offers the opportunity to holders of Nicor common and preferred shares to purchase additional shares of Nicor common stock by reinvesting the dividends and or making direct cash purchases. Shares are acquired by Nicor on behalf of participants through purchases in the open market. Nicor amended the program in 2009 to allow Nicor to issue new shares of common stock as an alternative to purchasing them in the open market. Any proceeds from newly issued shares may be used for advances to or equity investments in its subsidiaries, for other investment opportunities, or for general corporate purposes. No new shares have been issued since the program was amended in 2009. In 2001, Nicor announced a $50 million common stock repurchase program, under which Nicor may purchase its common stock as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities. There were no repurchases under this program since 2002. As of December 31, 2010, $21.5 million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock. Preferred Stock. In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends. As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share. Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption. 35 Table of Contents Off balance sheet arrangements. Nicor has certain guarantees, as further described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19 Guarantees and Indemnities. The company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual obligations. At December 31, 2010, Nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Purchase obligations $ 480.8 $ 264.8 $ 32.1 $ 5.2 $ 782.9 Long term debt 75.0 425.0 500.0 Fixed interest on long term debt 26.1 51.3 51.3 342.7 471.4 Operating leases 17.5 14.7 5.3 11.5 49.0 $ 599.4 $ 330.8 $ 88.7 $ 784.4 $ 1,803.3 In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above, Nicor has potential liabilities to taxing authorities (unrecognized tax benefits) which are dependent on the resolution of particular income tax positions. The timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with such potential liabilities is uncertain. The company had accrued a liability for estimated unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million at December 31, 2010, for which the amount and timing of payments is uncertain. The company also has long term obligations for postretirement benefits which are not included in the above table. Information regarding the companys obligations for postretirement benefits can be found in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits. Purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing businesses. Natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010. Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the other energy ventures. Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment. Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. OTHER MATTERS Storage Projects. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 20 12. The company estimates the net capital cost for the Central Valley project to be approximately $120 million. 36 Table of Contents Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawgrass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Application for Approval of Energy Efficiency Plan. On September 29, 2010, Nicor Gas filed an application with the ICC seeking approval of an energy efficiency plan. The filing was made pursuant to an Illinois law enacted in 2009 that requires local gas distribution utilities to establish plans to achieve specified energy savings goals beginning in June 2011 and provides utilities with a rider to collect the costs of the plan from customers. Under its proposed plan, the company estimates that it would bill nearly $100 million to customers under the rider, over a three year period commencing June 1, 2011, to fund the costs of various energy savings programs identified in the companys filing. Petition for Re approval of Operating Agreement. On July 1, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a petition seeking re approval from the ICC of the operating agreement that governs many inter company transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. The petition was filed pursuant to a requirement contained in the ICC order approving the companys most recent general rate increase and requested that the operating agreement be re approved without change. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding and are seeking modifications on a prospective basis to the operating agreement. Among the proposals are several by the ICC Staff and intervenors that would preclude Nicor Gas from continuing to provide certain services to support warranty produc ts that are sold by Nicor Services. Specifically, Nicor Services currently uses Nicor Gas personnel to assist in some sales solicitation for these warranty products and to provide repair services for some of these products. Nicor Gas does not believe these proposed modifications are appropriate and is opposing them. If these proposed modifications to the operating agreement are approved by the ICC, it would require changes in the way Nicor Services provides its warranty products and could adversely impact the future profitability of these products. As the ICC will be required to evaluate future transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates in connection with the joint application of AGL Resources, Nicor and Nicor Gas for approval of the merger of AGL Resources and Nicor, Nicor Gas has a motion pending with the ICC to suspend this proceeding. Financial Reform Legislation. Financial Reform Legislation was enacted into law on July 21, 2010, and includes a provision that requires certain over the counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared and also includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation will be established through rulemakings. While the company does not currently believe the legislation will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, the company will continue to evaluate the legislation and future rulemakings. Synthetic Natural Gas Plant Legislation. In January 2011, the Illinois House and Senate passed legislation regarding two proposed synthetic natural gas plants. Unless vetoed by the governor, the legislation will go into effect no later than March 15, 2011 and will require Nicor Gas and other major Illinois natural gas utilities to either: (a) submit to rate cases in 2011, 2013 and 2015, or (b) purchase under long term contracts (30 years for one plant and 10 years for the other) natural gas from the plants at a cost that may exceed the market price of natural gas. The legislation would allow Nicor Gas to recover the gas costs, and any related transportation costs, through the PGA without any further prudence review. Other. Restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to Nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the companys ability to meet its cash obligations. 37 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Nicors 2011 outlook assumes weather based on historical patterns, but excludes, among other things, the impact (including any merger and integration costs incurred in 2011) of the proposed merger with AGL Resources and the ICCs PBR plan/PGA review, other contingencies or future changes in tax law. The companys outlook also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments at Nicor Enerchange and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. While these items could materially affect 2011 earnings, they are currently not estimable. Gas distribution. Nicor Gas estimated operating results will decrease in 2011 as the result of the absence of the prior year $32 million pretax benefit attributable to the ICCs approval of the companys bad debt rider, higher operating and maintenance costs and higher depreciation expense. The company estimates that a 100 degree day variation from normal weather affects Nicor Gas distribution margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1.3 million. The consolidated impact, however, is generally reduced somewhat because of the natural weather hedge attributable to the utility bill management products offered by certain of Nicors other energy ventures. Shipping. Tropical Shippings 2011 operating results are estimated to be higher than 2010 as a result of estimated increases in base rates and cost reduction initiatives. The company also continues to expect relatively low tax costs on operating earnings in 2011 attributable to the 2006 reorganization of certain shipping and related operations. Other energy ventures. The company expects 2011 operating results from its other energy ventures to be similar to 2010s. Other. The company also expects 2011 net income to be adversely impacted by the absence of favorable tax reserve adjustments recognized in 2010 and higher state income taxes. CONTINGENCIES The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition. PBR plan. Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan is currently under ICC review. There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proce edings). As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery. The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter. In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff. The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan. The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan. 38 Table of Contents In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation. The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002. A copy of the Report is available at the Nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the ICC Proceedings. In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls. The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability. Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency. A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million. Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan. In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties. By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999 2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings. In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false. Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers. On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions. On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions. CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings. It is not possible to deter mine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings. In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan. Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT. In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007. In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007. In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively. No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter. Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder. Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Litigation relating to proposed merger. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.). The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Co ok County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 10, 2010; Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 13, 2010; Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 17, 2010; and Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al., filed December 17, 2010). The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages. On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated. Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The final disposition of these shareholder litigation related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition. Mercury. Information about mercury contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Manufactured gas plant sites. The company is conducting environmental investigations and remedial activities at former manufactured gas plant sites. Additional information about these sites is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Manufactured Gas Plant Sites. Municipal tax matters. Information about municipal tax contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Municipal Tax Matters. Other. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. See Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Other. 40 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which regularly require Nicors management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods. The application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect Nicors reported results and financial condition. The company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements. These significant policies and estimates are described throughout Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there are numerous areas in which Nicors management makes significant accounting estimates, it believes its critical estimates are those that require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments. Nicors management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors. Its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies, derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, credit risk, unbilled revenues and regulatory assets and liabilities because they are estimates which could materially impact Nicors financial statements. Loss contingencies. Nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss, including related legal defense costs, is reasonably estimable. When only a range of potential loss is estimable, the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss. Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies. These loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time, estimates may change significantly from period to period, and the companys ultimate obligations may differ materiall y from its recorded amounts. Of particular note is the PBR plan contingency at Nicor Gas described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies. Derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in managements assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules. As a result, management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedg e effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. These determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefits. The companys cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions, including life expectancies, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs. Actual experience in any one period, particularly the actual return on plan assets, often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions. When cumulatively significant, the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized into operating income over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans (approximately 9 years for the pen sion plan and 12 years for the health care plan). Additional information is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits, including plan asset investment allocation, estimated future benefit payments, general descriptions of the plans, significant assumptions, the impact of certain changes in assumptions and significant changes in estimates. 41 Table of Contents The companys postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) included in operating income was $19.6 million, $24.6 million and $2.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company expects to record postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) for 2011 of $18.7 million. Significant market declines in the values of plan assets in 2008 caused the increase in postretirement benefit expense for the years after 2008. Actuarial assumptions affecting 2011 include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent and discount rates of 5.40 percent for the companys defined benefit pension plan and 5.20 percent for the health care and other benefits plans, compared with an 8.25 percent rate of return on plan assets and discount rates of 5.45 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Nicor Gas establishes its expected long term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management. Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability based models. The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching st udy using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread. The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market. The discount rate is critical to the measurement of the plans costs. Additionally, the assumed rate of return on plan assets is critical to the determination of the pension plans cost. The following table illustrates the effect of a one percentage point change in these actuarial assumptions on 2010s net benefit cost (in millions): Actuarial assumption Increase (decrease) Effect on net benefit cost Discount rate 1.0 % $(6.2 ) (1.0 %) 7.4 Rate of return on plan assets 1.0 % (3.5 ) (1.0 %) 3.5 Income taxes. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. The evaluation is based on a two step approach. The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes between what the company recognizes as an unrecognized tax benefit and what is actually settled with the taxing authority could be materially different. Credit risk. The company is required to estimate counterparty credit risk in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments. The companys counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies and financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact the companys exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one cou nterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 42 Table of Contents However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this uncertainty, actual losses relating to credit risk could materially vary from Nicors estimates. The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments. Such estimates are based on historical experience, existing economic conditions and certain collection related patterns. Circumstances which could affect these estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, natural gas prices, customer deposits and economic conditions. Actual credit losses could vary materially from Nicors estimates. Nicors allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27.6 million, $33.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as presented on Schedule II in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The impact of credit losses to Nicors results of o perations is substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider that was approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. Unbilled revenues. Nicor Gas accrues revenues for natural gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end. Accrued unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment, including weather factors. These estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur, and variances in estimates can be material. Accrued unbilled revenues for Nicor Gas at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $141.8 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois. As a rate regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures. If Nicor Gas operations become no longe r subject to rate regulation, a write off of net regulatory liabilities would be required. Additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Accounting Policies. 43 Table of Contents CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document includes certain forward looking statements about the expectations of Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Although Nicor believes these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, planned, potential, should, will, would, project, estimate, ultimate, or similar phrases. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the companys forward looking statements due, among other things, to the outcome of the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, the direct or indirect effects of legal contingencies (including litigation) and the resolution of those issues, including the effects of an ICC review, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Specifically with respect to the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, Nicors expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are several factors many beyond the companys control that could cause results to differ significantly from its expectations. Such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that the companys business may suffer as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; the possibility that AGL Resources and Nicor will not receive the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger or that the merger will not be consummated for other reasons; the possibility of adverse decisions in pending and potential state and federal class action lawsuits, including five shareholder suits, relating to the merger; the possibility that the company may not be able to maintain relationships with its employees, suppliers, or customers as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; and the possibility that the Merger Agreement will be terminated under circumstances in which the company would incur termination payment obligations. Other factors that could cause materially different results include, but are not limited to, weather conditions; natural disasters; natural gas and other fuel prices; fair value accounting adjustments; inventory valuation; health care costs; insurance costs or recoveries; legal costs; borrowing needs; interest rates; credit conditions; economic and market conditions; accidents, leaks, equipment failures, service interruptions, environmental pollution, and other operating risks; tourism and construction in the Bahamas and Caribbean region; energy conservation; legislative and regulatory actions; tax rulings or audit results; asset sales; significant unplanned capital needs; future mercury related charges or credits; changes in accounting principles, interpr etations, methods, judgments or estimates; performance of major customers, transporters, suppliers and contractors; labor relations; and acts of terrorism. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing. Nicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations, including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates. Nicors practice is to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods, as deemed appropriate. Commodity price risk. With regard to commodity price risk, the company has established policies and procedures with respect to the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks. Company management oversees compliance with such policies and procedures. Nicors other energy businesses utilize various techniques to limit, measure and monitor market risk, including limits based on volume, dollar amounts, maturity, and in some cases value at risk (VaR). VaR is a tool to assess the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. The company has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected. The companys commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification. In accordance with SEC disclosure requirements, Nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices. Management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary. Losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the 10 percent shift used for the analyses. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is substantially mitigated because of Illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers. However, substantial changes in natural gas prices may impact Nicor Gas earnings by increasing or decreasing the cost of gas used by the company, storage related gas costs, and other operating and financing expenses. The company expects to purchase in 2011 about 2 Bcf of natural gas for its own use and to cover storage related gas costs. The volume of natural gas purchased by the company, which is exposed to market risk, has declined over the last two years as a result of certain changes approved in the 2009 rate orders. The level of natu ral gas prices may also impact customer gas consumption and therefore gas distribution margin. The actual impact of natural gas price fluctuations on Nicor Gas earnings is dependent upon several factors, including the companys hedging practices. The company generally hedges its forecasted company use and storage related gas costs through the use of swap agreements. Nicors other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from purchase and sale agreements, transportation agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management contracts. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Based on Nicors other energy businesses unhedged positions at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent adverse change in natural gas prices would have decreased Nicors earnings for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by about $0.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Nicors other energy businesses entered into derivative instruments to hedge the natural gas commodity price risk associated with its forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the Central Valley natural gas storage facility. At December 31, 2010, these derivatives totaled approximately 1.4 Bcf and had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Enerchange, Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, held derivative contracts with the following net asset (liability) fair values (in millions): Maturity Source of Fair Value Total Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years Prices actively quoted $ (8.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.6 ) Prices correlated to external sources 28.2 18.9 9.3 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (6.9 ) (5.2 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 13.0 $ 9.0 $ 4.0 Actively quoted prices are for those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX. Nicor Enerchange enters into over the counter derivative instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange traded instruments in active markets. Nicor Enerchange uses one or more significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices. Tropical Shippings objective is to substantially mitigate its exposure to higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges. Credit risk. The company has a diversified customer base, which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class and believes that it maintains prudent credit policies. Additionally, the gas distribution business offers options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. This risk has been substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expe nse included in its rates for the respective year. The company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty, customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one counterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this u ncertainty, the company has taken additional steps including, but not limited to, reducing available credit to some of its counterparties. Interest rate risk. Nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates. The company manages its interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. At December 31, 2010, if market rates were to hypothetically increase by 10 percent from Nicors weighted average floating interest rate on commercial paper, interest expense would have increased causing Nicors earnings to decrease by less than $0.1 million in 2010. Nicor holds forward starting interest rate swaps maturing in 2012 with a notional totaling $90 million. These swaps had a net liability fair value of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 . The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices that correlate to external sources. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement and then amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for factors that can impact year to year comparisons and may affect the future performance of Nicors business. 22 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from 2008 to 2010 and to discuss business trends that might affect Nicor. Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii. The discussion is organized into seven sections Summary, Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, Other Matters, Outlook, Contingencies and Critical Accounting Estimates. SUMMARY Nicor is a holding company. Gas distribution is Nicors primary business. Nicors subsidiaries include Nicor Gas, one of the nations largest distributors of natural gas, and Tropical Shipping, a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. Nicor also owns several energy related ventures, including Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, which provide energy related products and services to retail markets, Nicor Enerchange, a wholesale natural gas marketing company, and Central Valley, which is developing a natural gas storage facility. Nicor also has equity interests in a cargo container leasing business, a FERC regulated natural gas pipeline, a natural gas storage development project and certain affordable housing investment s. Net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below (in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 138.4 $ 135.5 $ 119.5 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 2.98 $ 2.63 When comparing 2010 results to 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include a $1.3 million pretax reduction ($.02 per share) to the companys previously established reserve for its mercury inspection and repair program. Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect higher operating income in the companys gas distribution business, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping and other energy related businesses, lower corporate operating results, lower equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate. When comparing 2009 results to 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2008 include an unfavorable pretax mercury related reserve adjustment of $0.6 million ($.01 per share). Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect improved operating results in the companys gas distribution business and other energy related businesses and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping business, lower interest income and a higher effective income tax rate. Proposed merger with AGL Resources. In December 2010, Nicor entered into a Merger Agreement with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the second half of 2011. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the ICC. Nicor anticipates that the necessary approvals will be obtained. 23 Table of Contents In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see Nicors Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger related costs. No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger. Rate proceeding. On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent. The order also approved an energy efficiency rider. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher. On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009. Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million. Bad debt rider. In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider. This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases. It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks. As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected. The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12 month period beginning June 2011. Health Care Reform Legislation. In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform. The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012. Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs. Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense. Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the Health Care Act contains other provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits. The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations. Capital market environment. The volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments, exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity. The company continues to review its investments, exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to this past volatility. Operating income. Operating income (loss) by the companys major businesses is presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 194.7 $ 149.7 $ 124.4 Shipping 14.4 29.2 39.3 Other energy ventures 34.4 45.5 25.3 Corporate and eliminations (7.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.0 ) $ 235.7 $ 220.3 $ 185.0 The following summarizes operating income (loss) comparisons by the companys major businesses: Gas distribution operating income increased $45.0 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher gas distribution margin ($47.4 million increase), a favorable mercury related reserve adjustment ($1.3 million) and gains on property sales ($1.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.2 million increase). Gas distribution operating income increased $25.3 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin ($39.0 million increase), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.5 million increase) and operating and maintenance expense ($5.8 million increase). Shipping operating income decreased $14.8 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($7.6 million decrease) and higher operating expenses ($7.2 million increase). Operating revenues were lower due to lower volumes shipped, partially offset by higher average rates. Operating expenses were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower charter costs and lower payroll and benefit related costs. Shipping operating income decreased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($72.6 million decrease), which were partially offset by lower operating costs ($62.5 million decrease). Lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates. Operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs, charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs. Nicors other energy ventures operating income decreased $11.1 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income at Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange ($13.5 million decrease), partially offset by higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($2.3 million increase). Lower operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valu ations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services 25 Table of Contents businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($11.4 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenue ($9.1 million decrease). Nicors other energy ventures operating income increased $20.2 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange ($18.2 million increase) and at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($1.7 million increase). Higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($7.0 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenues ($5.3 million decrease). Nicor Enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. A source of commodity price risk arises as Nicor Enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale. However, gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market, whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. In addition, Nicor Enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utili ty bill management products offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. The gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided. However, the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value. For derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Corporate and eliminations operating income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was impacted by the following items: In 2010, corporate and eliminations operating income included $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of $1.3 million, $3.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather (excludes costs of approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, recorded within other energy ventures). The above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk. The amount of the offset attributable t o the utility bill management products marketed by Nicors other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year, weather patterns, the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas. In 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of $3.1 million. The legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe. The total recovery was $5.0 million, of which $3.1 million was allocated to corporate and $1.9 million was allocated to the gas distribution business (recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense). 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review. The following discussion summarizes the major items impacting Nicors operating income. Operating revenues. Operating revenues by the companys major businesses are presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Shipping 345.0 352.6 425.2 Other energy ventures 218.4 239.0 230.3 Corporate and eliminations (58.0 ) (80.3 ) (85.8 ) $ 2,709.8 $ 2,652.1 $ 3,776.6 Gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review. Gas distribution operating revenues increased $63.6 million in 2010 compared the prior year due to higher natural gas costs (approximately $110 million increase), revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $75 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $25 million decrease). Gas distribution operating revenues decreased $1,066.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs (approximately $900 million decrease), warmer weather in 2009 (approximately $140 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $60 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase). Shipping operating revenues decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($11.8 million decrease), partially offset by higher average rates ($4.2 million increase). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown. Higher average rates were attributable to higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel, partially offset by a reduction in base rates. Shipping operating revenues decreased $72.6 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($44.2 million decrease) and lower average rates ($28.4 million decrease). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown. Lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel. Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues decreased $20.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($11.5 million decrease) and Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($9.1 million decrease). Lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and ser vices businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract attributable to lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. 27 Table of Contents Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues increased $8.7 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($13.9 million increase), partially offset by lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($5.3 million decrease). Higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Lower revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against Nicor Solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products and Nicor Enerchange net revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy. Gas distribution margin. Nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues. Gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, and revenue taxes, for which Nicor Gas earns a small administrative fee. These items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues, with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense, with no direct impact on gas distribution margin. The 2009 rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs. Ad ditionally, in February 2010 the ICC approved the companys bad debt rider. As a result, changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these riders are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense. A reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution revenues $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Cost of gas (1,364.1 ) (1,345.7 ) (2,427.8 ) Revenue tax expense (145.9 ) (148.1 ) (171.1 ) Gas distribution margin $ 694.4 $ 647.0 $ 608.0 Gas distribution margin increased $47.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $8 million decrease), lower interest on customer balances ($5.5 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $4 million decrease). Gas distribution margin increased $39.0 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather (approximately $8 million decrease), lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $5 million decrease) and lower revenue from cost recovery riders (approximately $3 million decrease). Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense. Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense decreased $0.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.9 million decrease), lower pension expense ($4.6 million decrease, net of capitalization), lower billing and call center related costs ($2.9 million decrease), lower costs on legal matters ($2.6 million decrease), higher bad debt expense ($10.6 million increase) and higher costs associated with the energy efficiency program ($8.8 million increase). Bad debt expense in 2010 was $63.8 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Bad debt expense in 2010 includes the recognition of the $31.7 million benefit associated with the net under recovery of bad debt expense from 2008 and 2009; $63.0 million of expense assumed to be collected through base rates; and $32.5 million of expense which is equal to the revenue recognized under the bad debt rider. 28 Table of Contents Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased $5.8 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs ($26.5 million increase of which $21.8 million relates to higher pension expense, net of capitalization), the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs ($3.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to a 2007 investigation of the presence of PCBs in the companys distribution system and $1.9 million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe), higher postage charges ($2.0 million increase) and higher costs on legal matters ($1.8 million increase). Partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense ($17.5 million decrease due to lower revenues attribu table principally to lower natural gas costs), lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.3 million decrease) and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the 2009 rate orders ($5.7 million decrease). Other gas distribution operating expenses. In 2010 and 2008, the company recorded favorable (unfavorable) reserve adjustments of $1.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively, associated with the companys mercury inspection and repair program. Additional information about the companys mercury inspection and repair program is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity. During 2010 and 2008, Nicor Gas realized pretax gains of $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The company periodically assesses its ownership of certain real estate holdings. Shipping operating expenses. Shipping operating expenses increased $7.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher transportation related costs ($8.7 million increase, largely attributable to higher fuel prices) and higher repairs and maintenance costs ($1.9 million increase), partially offset by lower charter costs ($3.6 million decrease) and lower payroll and benefit related costs ($2.0 million decrease). Shipping operating expenses decreased $62.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower transportation related costs ($36.9 million decrease, largely attributable to lower volumes shipped and fuel prices), charter costs ($10.1 million decrease) and payroll and benefit related costs ($5.8 million decrease). Other energy ventures operating expenses. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $9.5 million in 2010 compared to prior year due to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($11.4 million decrease) attributable to lower average cost per utility bill management contract resulting from lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $11.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($7.0 million decrease) and at Nicor Enerchange ($4.3 million decrease). The decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower average costs associated with utility bill management contracts, partially offset by higher average contract volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs attributable to business growth. The decrease in operating expenses at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to lower transportat ion and storage charges attributable to lower natural gas prices. Other corporate expenses and eliminations. Other corporate operating expenses (income) were $6.8 million, $0.6 million and $(2.0) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in other corporate operating expenses for 2010 is $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2008, Nicor recorded a benefit of $3.1 million related to recoveries of previously incurred legal costs. Also included in the amounts for all years presented are certain business development costs. 29 Table of Contents Intercompany eliminations were $(57.0) million, $(76.7) million and $(79.8) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and related primarily to utility bill management products. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower interest on income tax matters ($2.9 million decrease), higher bank commitment fees ($1.7 million increase) and higher average borrowing levels ($1.1 million increase). Interest expense decreased $1.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower average interest rates ($5.3 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of higher interest on income tax matters ($1.9 million increase) and bank commitment fees ($1.5 million increase). Net equity investment income. Net equity investment income decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to the absence of a $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys 50 percent interest in EN Engineering in 2009, partially offset by an increase in income from the companys investment in Triton ($2.5 million increase). Net equity investment income increased $6.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys interest in EN Engineering, partially offset by the absence of income from the companys investment in EN Engineering ($2.8 million decrease) and a decrease in income from the companys investment in Triton ($1.1 million decrease). Equity investment results include $7.8 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for Nicors share of income from Triton. Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower interest on tax matters ($1.1 million decrease). Interest income decreased $6.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of lower average interest rates ($2.5 million decrease), interest on tax matters ($2.2 million decrease) and average investment balances ($1.5 million decrease). Income tax expense. In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations. The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization. Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $2 3 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings. At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 33.5 percent, 32.4 percent and 27.0 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies, partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments. The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

These resources include net cash flow from operating activities, access to capital markets, lines of credit and short term investments. Capital market conditions are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to access capital. Operating cash flows. The gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather, natural gas prices, the timing of collections from customers, natural gas purchasing, and storage and hedging practices. The company relies on short term borrowings, backed by bank lines of credit, to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs. Cash requirements generally increase over the last half of the year due to increases in natural gas purchases, gas in storage and accounts receivable. During the first half of the year, positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable. &#1 60;This cash is typically used to substantially reduce, or eliminate, short term debt during the first half of the year. Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions. These margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices. The company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings and investments. Net cash flow provided from operating activities decreased $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2009/2010 heating season compared to the 2008/2009 heating season and include: a decrease of $178.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and a decrease of $102.8 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. In addition, the company had higher volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Net cash flow provided from operating activities increased $598.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the increase in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2008/2009 heating season compared to the 2007/2008 heating season and include: an increase of $245.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and an increase of $238.6 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the company had lower volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 when compared to 2008. Investing activities. Net cash flow used for investing activities was $229.2 million, $211.5 million and $265.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is an internal measure utilized by management that represents cash additions to property, plant and equipment, adjusted for items including the accrual of work performed through period end and other non cash items, contributions in aid of construction and expenditures associated with asset retirement obligations. Capital expenditures by the companys major businesses are presented in the following table (in millions): Estimated 2011 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 205 $ 198 $ 203 $ 229 Shipping 26 15 22 17 Other energy ventures 129 28 6 4 $ 360 $ 241 $ 231 $ 250 Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $6 million decrease), lower facility construction (approximately $3 million decrease), lower capitalized overhead costs attributable to lower postretirement benefit costs (approximately $2 million decrease) and higher information technology improvements (approximately $8 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2009 versus 2008 due to the impact of lower customer additions (approximately $10 million decrease), information technology improvements (approximately $10 million decrease), facility construction (approximately $9 million decrease) and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $7 million decrease), partially offset by higher capitalized overhead costs attributable to higher postretirement benefit costs (approximately $9 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010. Factors contributing to the expected increase include higher expenditures associated with facility construction and new service additions and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements. Shipping capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to a decrease in progress payments on the construction of a new vessel. Shipping capital expenditures increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to progress payments on the construction of a new vessel, partially offset by a decrease in facility expansion. Shipping capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010 due primarily to increased expenditures related to freight handling equipment, containers and information technology system improvements. Other energy ventures capital expenditures increased in 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to expenditures related to the development of a natural gas storage facility by Central Valley (approximately $18 million increase). 33 Table of Contents Other energy ventures capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $120 million due to the continued development of the storage facility by Central Valley. Included in these capital expenditures is conditioning gas, to ready the field for use, that is expected to be injected in 2011 and withdrawn and sold in 2012. Additional investing activities. Yearly fluctuations in additional investing activities include the following items: 2009 and 2008 reflect increased short term investments primarily at the companys shipping business. In March 2009, the company sold its 50 percent interest in EN Engineering and received cash of $13.0 million. Financing activities. Nicor and Nicor Gas access to financing at competitive rates is, in part, dependent on its credit ratings. The current credit ratings for Nicor Inc. and Nicor Gas are as follows: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Nicor Inc. Commercial Paper A 1+ P 2 F 1 Senior Unsecured Debt AA n/a A Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a Nicor Gas Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 F 1 Senior Secured Debt AA Aa3 AA Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 A+ Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a In December 2010, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas credit ratings. S&P changed Nicor and Nicor Gas outlooks from stable to credit watch with negative implications. Moodys affirmed Nicors outlook as stable, but changed Nicor Gas outlook from stable to negative. Fitch maintained the outlook as stable for both Nicor and Nicor Gas. Both S&P and Moodys attributed the change in outlook to the proposed merger with AGL Resources. Long term debt. The company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt, for construction programs (to the extent not provided by internally generated funds) and for general corporate purposes. In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011. In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired. In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million in First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement. In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $470 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds under the terms of its indenture. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a $225 million capacity, which became effective on March 20, 2009. In 2010, Nicor entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long term fixed rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility. Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. Nicor believes it is in compliance with its debt covenants. Nicors long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. Short term debt. In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011, to replace the $550 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010. These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper. The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. &#1 60;During 2010, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $512 million to no commercial paper and averaged $269 million. During 2009, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $759 million to $216 million and averaged $417 million. The average borrowing levels are calculated using average daily balances for each day for the year. The company expects that funding from commercial paper and related backup line of credit agreements will continue to be available in the foreseeable future and sufficient to meet estimated cash requirements. Common stock. Nicor maintained its quarterly common stock dividend rate during 2010 of $0.465 per common share. The company paid dividends on its common stock of $85.1 million, $84.8 million and $84.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter. Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nicor currently has a dividend reinvestment program that offers the opportunity to holders of Nicor common and preferred shares to purchase additional shares of Nicor common stock by reinvesting the dividends and or making direct cash purchases. Shares are acquired by Nicor on behalf of participants through purchases in the open market. Nicor amended the program in 2009 to allow Nicor to issue new shares of common stock as an alternative to purchasing them in the open market. Any proceeds from newly issued shares may be used for advances to or equity investments in its subsidiaries, for other investment opportunities, or for general corporate purposes. No new shares have been issued since the program was amended in 2009. In 2001, Nicor announced a $50 million common stock repurchase program, under which Nicor may purchase its common stock as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities. There were no repurchases under this program since 2002. As of December 31, 2010, $21.5 million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock. Preferred Stock. In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends. As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share. Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption. 35 Table of Contents Off balance sheet arrangements. Nicor has certain guarantees, as further described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19 Guarantees and Indemnities. The company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual obligations. At December 31, 2010, Nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Purchase obligations $ 480.8 $ 264.8 $ 32.1 $ 5.2 $ 782.9 Long term debt 75.0 425.0 500.0 Fixed interest on long term debt 26.1 51.3 51.3 342.7 471.4 Operating leases 17.5 14.7 5.3 11.5 49.0 $ 599.4 $ 330.8 $ 88.7 $ 784.4 $ 1,803.3 In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above, Nicor has potential liabilities to taxing authorities (unrecognized tax benefits) which are dependent on the resolution of particular income tax positions. The timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with such potential liabilities is uncertain. The company had accrued a liability for estimated unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million at December 31, 2010, for which the amount and timing of payments is uncertain. The company also has long term obligations for postretirement benefits which are not included in the above table. Information regarding the companys obligations for postretirement benefits can be found in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits. Purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing businesses. Natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010. Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the other energy ventures. Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment. Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. OTHER MATTERS Storage Projects. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 20 12. The company estimates the net capital cost for the Central Valley project to be approximately $120 million. 36 Table of Contents Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawgrass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Application for Approval of Energy Efficiency Plan. On September 29, 2010, Nicor Gas filed an application with the ICC seeking approval of an energy efficiency plan. The filing was made pursuant to an Illinois law enacted in 2009 that requires local gas distribution utilities to establish plans to achieve specified energy savings goals beginning in June 2011 and provides utilities with a rider to collect the costs of the plan from customers. Under its proposed plan, the company estimates that it would bill nearly $100 million to customers under the rider, over a three year period commencing June 1, 2011, to fund the costs of various energy savings programs identified in the companys filing. Petition for Re approval of Operating Agreement. On July 1, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a petition seeking re approval from the ICC of the operating agreement that governs many inter company transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. The petition was filed pursuant to a requirement contained in the ICC order approving the companys most recent general rate increase and requested that the operating agreement be re approved without change. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding and are seeking modifications on a prospective basis to the operating agreement. Among the proposals are several by the ICC Staff and intervenors that would preclude Nicor Gas from continuing to provide certain services to support warranty produc ts that are sold by Nicor Services. Specifically, Nicor Services currently uses Nicor Gas personnel to assist in some sales solicitation for these warranty products and to provide repair services for some of these products. Nicor Gas does not believe these proposed modifications are appropriate and is opposing them. If these proposed modifications to the operating agreement are approved by the ICC, it would require changes in the way Nicor Services provides its warranty products and could adversely impact the future profitability of these products. As the ICC will be required to evaluate future transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates in connection with the joint application of AGL Resources, Nicor and Nicor Gas for approval of the merger of AGL Resources and Nicor, Nicor Gas has a motion pending with the ICC to suspend this proceeding. Financial Reform Legislation. Financial Reform Legislation was enacted into law on July 21, 2010, and includes a provision that requires certain over the counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared and also includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation will be established through rulemakings. While the company does not currently believe the legislation will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, the company will continue to evaluate the legislation and future rulemakings. Synthetic Natural Gas Plant Legislation. In January 2011, the Illinois House and Senate passed legislation regarding two proposed synthetic natural gas plants. Unless vetoed by the governor, the legislation will go into effect no later than March 15, 2011 and will require Nicor Gas and other major Illinois natural gas utilities to either: (a) submit to rate cases in 2011, 2013 and 2015, or (b) purchase under long term contracts (30 years for one plant and 10 years for the other) natural gas from the plants at a cost that may exceed the market price of natural gas. The legislation would allow Nicor Gas to recover the gas costs, and any related transportation costs, through the PGA without any further prudence review. Other. Restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to Nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the companys ability to meet its cash obligations. 37 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Nicors 2011 outlook assumes weather based on historical patterns, but excludes, among other things, the impact (including any merger and integration costs incurred in 2011) of the proposed merger with AGL Resources and the ICCs PBR plan/PGA review, other contingencies or future changes in tax law. The companys outlook also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments at Nicor Enerchange and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. While these items could materially affect 2011 earnings, they are currently not estimable. Gas distribution. Nicor Gas estimated operating results will decrease in 2011 as the result of the absence of the prior year $32 million pretax benefit attributable to the ICCs approval of the companys bad debt rider, higher operating and maintenance costs and higher depreciation expense. The company estimates that a 100 degree day variation from normal weather affects Nicor Gas distribution margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1.3 million. The consolidated impact, however, is generally reduced somewhat because of the natural weather hedge attributable to the utility bill management products offered by certain of Nicors other energy ventures. Shipping. Tropical Shippings 2011 operating results are estimated to be higher than 2010 as a result of estimated increases in base rates and cost reduction initiatives. The company also continues to expect relatively low tax costs on operating earnings in 2011 attributable to the 2006 reorganization of certain shipping and related operations. Other energy ventures. The company expects 2011 operating results from its other energy ventures to be similar to 2010s. Other. The company also expects 2011 net income to be adversely impacted by the absence of favorable tax reserve adjustments recognized in 2010 and higher state income taxes. CONTINGENCIES The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition. PBR plan. Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan is currently under ICC review. There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proce edings). As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery. The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter. In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff. The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan. The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan. 38 Table of Contents In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation. The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002. A copy of the Report is available at the Nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the ICC Proceedings. In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls. The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability. Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency. A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million. Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan. In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties. By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999 2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings. In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false. Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers. On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions. On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions. CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings. It is not possible to deter mine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings. In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan. Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT. In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007. In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007. In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively. No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter. Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder. Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Litigation relating to proposed merger. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.). The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Co ok County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 10, 2010; Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 13, 2010; Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 17, 2010; and Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al., filed December 17, 2010). The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages. On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated. Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The final disposition of these shareholder litigation related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition. Mercury. Information about mercury contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Manufactured gas plant sites. The company is conducting environmental investigations and remedial activities at former manufactured gas plant sites. Additional information about these sites is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Manufactured Gas Plant Sites. Municipal tax matters. Information about municipal tax contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Municipal Tax Matters. Other. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. See Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Other. 40 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which regularly require Nicors management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods. The application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect Nicors reported results and financial condition. The company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements. These significant policies and estimates are described throughout Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there are numerous areas in which Nicors management makes significant accounting estimates, it believes its critical estimates are those that require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments. Nicors management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors. Its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies, derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, credit risk, unbilled revenues and regulatory assets and liabilities because they are estimates which could materially impact Nicors financial statements. Loss contingencies. Nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss, including related legal defense costs, is reasonably estimable. When only a range of potential loss is estimable, the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss. Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies. These loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time, estimates may change significantly from period to period, and the companys ultimate obligations may differ materiall y from its recorded amounts. Of particular note is the PBR plan contingency at Nicor Gas described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies. Derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in managements assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules. As a result, management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedg e effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. These determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefits. The companys cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions, including life expectancies, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs. Actual experience in any one period, particularly the actual return on plan assets, often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions. When cumulatively significant, the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized into operating income over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans (approximately 9 years for the pen sion plan and 12 years for the health care plan). Additional information is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits, including plan asset investment allocation, estimated future benefit payments, general descriptions of the plans, significant assumptions, the impact of certain changes in assumptions and significant changes in estimates. 41 Table of Contents The companys postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) included in operating income was $19.6 million, $24.6 million and $2.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company expects to record postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) for 2011 of $18.7 million. Significant market declines in the values of plan assets in 2008 caused the increase in postretirement benefit expense for the years after 2008. Actuarial assumptions affecting 2011 include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent and discount rates of 5.40 percent for the companys defined benefit pension plan and 5.20 percent for the health care and other benefits plans, compared with an 8.25 percent rate of return on plan assets and discount rates of 5.45 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Nicor Gas establishes its expected long term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management. Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability based models. The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching st udy using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread. The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market. The discount rate is critical to the measurement of the plans costs. Additionally, the assumed rate of return on plan assets is critical to the determination of the pension plans cost. The following table illustrates the effect of a one percentage point change in these actuarial assumptions on 2010s net benefit cost (in millions): Actuarial assumption Increase (decrease) Effect on net benefit cost Discount rate 1.0 % $(6.2 ) (1.0 %) 7.4 Rate of return on plan assets 1.0 % (3.5 ) (1.0 %) 3.5 Income taxes. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. The evaluation is based on a two step approach. The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes between what the company recognizes as an unrecognized tax benefit and what is actually settled with the taxing authority could be materially different. Credit risk. The company is required to estimate counterparty credit risk in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments. The companys counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies and financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact the companys exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one cou nterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 42 Table of Contents However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this uncertainty, actual losses relating to credit risk could materially vary from Nicors estimates. The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments. Such estimates are based on historical experience, existing economic conditions and certain collection related patterns. Circumstances which could affect these estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, natural gas prices, customer deposits and economic conditions. Actual credit losses could vary materially from Nicors estimates. Nicors allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27.6 million, $33.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as presented on Schedule II in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The impact of credit losses to Nicors results of o perations is substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider that was approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. Unbilled revenues. Nicor Gas accrues revenues for natural gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end. Accrued unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment, including weather factors. These estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur, and variances in estimates can be material. Accrued unbilled revenues for Nicor Gas at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $141.8 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois. As a rate regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures. If Nicor Gas operations become no longe r subject to rate regulation, a write off of net regulatory liabilities would be required. Additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Accounting Policies. 43 Table of Contents CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document includes certain forward looking statements about the expectations of Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Although Nicor believes these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, planned, potential, should, will, would, project, estimate, ultimate, or similar phrases. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the companys forward looking statements due, among other things, to the outcome of the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, the direct or indirect effects of legal contingencies (including litigation) and the resolution of those issues, including the effects of an ICC review, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Specifically with respect to the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, Nicors expectations are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, and there are several factors many beyond the companys control that could cause results to differ significantly from its expectations. Such events, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that the companys business may suffer as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; the possibility that AGL Resources and Nicor will not receive the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger or that the merger will not be consummated for other reasons; the possibility of adverse decisions in pending and potential state and federal class action lawsuits, including five shareholder suits, relating to the merger; the possibility that the company may not be able to maintain relationships with its employees, suppliers, or customers as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the merger; and the possibility that the Merger Agreement will be terminated under circumstances in which the company would incur termination payment obligations. Other factors that could cause materially different results include, but are not limited to, weather conditions; natural disasters; natural gas and other fuel prices; fair value accounting adjustments; inventory valuation; health care costs; insurance costs or recoveries; legal costs; borrowing needs; interest rates; credit conditions; economic and market conditions; accidents, leaks, equipment failures, service interruptions, environmental pollution, and other operating risks; tourism and construction in the Bahamas and Caribbean region; energy conservation; legislative and regulatory actions; tax rulings or audit results; asset sales; significant unplanned capital needs; future mercury related charges or credits; changes in accounting principles, interpr etations, methods, judgments or estimates; performance of major customers, transporters, suppliers and contractors; labor relations; and acts of terrorism. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this filing. Nicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this filing. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations, including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates. Nicors practice is to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods, as deemed appropriate. Commodity price risk. With regard to commodity price risk, the company has established policies and procedures with respect to the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks. Company management oversees compliance with such policies and procedures. Nicors other energy businesses utilize various techniques to limit, measure and monitor market risk, including limits based on volume, dollar amounts, maturity, and in some cases value at risk (VaR). VaR is a tool to assess the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. The company has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected. The companys commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification. In accordance with SEC disclosure requirements, Nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices. Management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary. Losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the 10 percent shift used for the analyses. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is substantially mitigated because of Illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers. However, substantial changes in natural gas prices may impact Nicor Gas earnings by increasing or decreasing the cost of gas used by the company, storage related gas costs, and other operating and financing expenses. The company expects to purchase in 2011 about 2 Bcf of natural gas for its own use and to cover storage related gas costs. The volume of natural gas purchased by the company, which is exposed to market risk, has declined over the last two years as a result of certain changes approved in the 2009 rate orders. The level of natu ral gas prices may also impact customer gas consumption and therefore gas distribution margin. The actual impact of natural gas price fluctuations on Nicor Gas earnings is dependent upon several factors, including the companys hedging practices. The company generally hedges its forecasted company use and storage related gas costs through the use of swap agreements. Nicors other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from purchase and sale agreements, transportation agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management contracts. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Based on Nicors other energy businesses unhedged positions at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent adverse change in natural gas prices would have decreased Nicors earnings for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by about $0.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Nicors other energy businesses entered into derivative instruments to hedge the natural gas commodity price risk associated with its forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the Central Valley natural gas storage facility. At December 31, 2010, these derivatives totaled approximately 1.4 Bcf and had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Enerchange, Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, held derivative contracts with the following net asset (liability) fair values (in millions): Maturity Source of Fair Value Total Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years Prices actively quoted $ (8.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.6 ) Prices correlated to external sources 28.2 18.9 9.3 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (6.9 ) (5.2 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 13.0 $ 9.0 $ 4.0 Actively quoted prices are for those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX. Nicor Enerchange enters into over the counter derivative instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange traded instruments in active markets. Nicor Enerchange uses one or more significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices. Tropical Shippings objective is to substantially mitigate its exposure to higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges. Credit risk. The company has a diversified customer base, which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class and believes that it maintains prudent credit policies. Additionally, the gas distribution business offers options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. This risk has been substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expe nse included in its rates for the respective year. The company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty, customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one counterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this u ncertainty, the company has taken additional steps including, but not limited to, reducing available credit to some of its counterparties. Interest rate risk. Nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates. The company manages its interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. At December 31, 2010, if market rates were to hypothetically increase by 10 percent from Nicors weighted average floating interest rate on commercial paper, interest expense would have increased causing Nicors earnings to decrease by less than $0.1 million in 2010. Nicor holds forward starting interest rate swaps maturing in 2012 with a notional totaling $90 million. These swaps had a net liability fair value of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 . The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices that correlate to external sources. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement and then amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt. For further information about debt securities, interest rates and fair values, see Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 Short Term and Long Term Debt and Note 7 Fair Value Measurements. 46 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The purpose of this financial review is to explain changes in operating results and financial condition from 2008 to 2010 and to discuss business trends that might affect Nicor. Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii. The discussion is organized into seven sections Summary, Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, Other Matters, Outlook, Contingencies and Critical Accounting Estimates. SUMMARY Nicor is a holding company. Gas distribution is Nicors primary business. Nicors subsidiaries include Nicor Gas, one of the nations largest distributors of natural gas, and Tropical Shipping, a transporter of containerized freight in the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. Nicor also owns several energy related ventures, including Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, which provide energy related products and services to retail markets, Nicor Enerchange, a wholesale natural gas marketing company, and Central Valley, which is developing a natural gas storage facility. Nicor also has equity interests in a cargo container leasing business, a FERC regulated natural gas pipeline, a natural gas storage development project and certain affordable housing investment s. Net income and diluted earnings per common share are presented below (in millions, except per share data): 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 138.4 $ 135.5 $ 119.5 Diluted earnings per common share $ 3.02 $ 2.98 $ 2.63 When comparing 2010 results to 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include a $1.3 million pretax reduction ($.02 per share) to the companys previously established reserve for its mercury inspection and repair program. Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect higher operating income in the companys gas distribution business, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping and other energy related businesses, lower corporate operating results, lower equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate. When comparing 2009 results to 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2008 include an unfavorable pretax mercury related reserve adjustment of $0.6 million ($.01 per share). Year over year comparisons (excluding the effect of the mercury related reserve adjustment) reflect improved operating results in the companys gas distribution business and other energy related businesses and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower operating income in the companys shipping business, lower interest income and a higher effective income tax rate. Proposed merger with AGL Resources. In December 2010, Nicor entered into a Merger Agreement with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the second half of 2011. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled, and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and approval by, among others, the ICC. Nicor anticipates that the necessary approvals will be obtained. 23 Table of Contents In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger. As stated above, approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger. The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicors gas distribution subsidiary at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion. The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances. For additional information relating to the proposed merger please see Nicors Form 8 K filed on December 7, 2010. Further information concerning the proposed merger was included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S 4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger related costs. No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger. Rate proceeding. On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent. The order also approved an energy efficiency rider. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009. On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher. On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent. Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009. Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million. Bad debt rider. In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009. On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider. This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases. It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks. As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected. The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million. The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12 month period beginning June 2011. Health Care Reform Legislation. In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform. The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012. Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D. Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs. Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense. Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date. 24 Table of Contents Additionally, the Health Care Act contains other provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits. The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations. Capital market environment. The volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments, exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity. The company continues to review its investments, exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to this past volatility. Operating income. Operating income (loss) by the companys major businesses is presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 194.7 $ 149.7 $ 124.4 Shipping 14.4 29.2 39.3 Other energy ventures 34.4 45.5 25.3 Corporate and eliminations (7.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.0 ) $ 235.7 $ 220.3 $ 185.0 The following summarizes operating income (loss) comparisons by the companys major businesses: Gas distribution operating income increased $45.0 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher gas distribution margin ($47.4 million increase), a favorable mercury related reserve adjustment ($1.3 million) and gains on property sales ($1.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.2 million increase). Gas distribution operating income increased $25.3 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin ($39.0 million increase), partially offset by higher depreciation expense ($6.5 million increase) and operating and maintenance expense ($5.8 million increase). Shipping operating income decreased $14.8 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($7.6 million decrease) and higher operating expenses ($7.2 million increase). Operating revenues were lower due to lower volumes shipped, partially offset by higher average rates. Operating expenses were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs and higher repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower charter costs and lower payroll and benefit related costs. Shipping operating income decreased $10.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues ($72.6 million decrease), which were partially offset by lower operating costs ($62.5 million decrease). Lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates. Operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs, charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs. Nicors other energy ventures operating income decreased $11.1 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income at Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange ($13.5 million decrease), partially offset by higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($2.3 million increase). Lower operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valu ations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services 25 Table of Contents businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($11.4 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenue ($9.1 million decrease). Nicors other energy ventures operating income increased $20.2 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange ($18.2 million increase) and at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($1.7 million increase). Higher operating income at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Higher operating income at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses ($7.0 million decrease), partially offset by lower operating revenues ($5.3 million decrease). Nicor Enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized. A source of commodity price risk arises as Nicor Enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale. However, gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market, whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change. In addition, Nicor Enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utili ty bill management products offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. The gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided. However, the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value. For derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period. Corporate and eliminations operating income for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was impacted by the following items: In 2010, corporate and eliminations operating income included $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of $1.3 million, $3.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively, associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather (excludes costs of approximately $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, recorded within other energy ventures). The above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries. The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk. The amount of the offset attributable t o the utility bill management products marketed by Nicors other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year, weather patterns, the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas. In 2008, corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of $3.1 million. The legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe. The total recovery was $5.0 million, of which $3.1 million was allocated to corporate and $1.9 million was allocated to the gas distribution business (recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense). 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review. The following discussion summarizes the major items impacting Nicors operating income. Operating revenues. Operating revenues by the companys major businesses are presented below (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Shipping 345.0 352.6 425.2 Other energy ventures 218.4 239.0 230.3 Corporate and eliminations (58.0 ) (80.3 ) (85.8 ) $ 2,709.8 $ 2,652.1 $ 3,776.6 Gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review. Gas distribution operating revenues increased $63.6 million in 2010 compared the prior year due to higher natural gas costs (approximately $110 million increase), revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $75 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $25 million decrease). Gas distribution operating revenues decreased $1,066.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs (approximately $900 million decrease), warmer weather in 2009 (approximately $140 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $60 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase). Shipping operating revenues decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($11.8 million decrease), partially offset by higher average rates ($4.2 million increase). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the continued economic slowdown. Higher average rates were attributable to higher cost recovery surcharges for fuel, partially offset by a reduction in base rates. Shipping operating revenues decreased $72.6 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped ($44.2 million decrease) and lower average rates ($28.4 million decrease). Volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown. Lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel. Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues decreased $20.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($11.5 million decrease) and Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($9.1 million decrease). Lower operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to unfavorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses and unfavorable costing of physical sales activity, partially offset by favorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory. Lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and ser vices businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract attributable to lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. 27 Table of Contents Nicors other energy ventures operating revenues increased $8.7 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange ($13.9 million increase), partially offset by lower operating revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($5.3 million decrease). Higher operating revenues at Nicor Enerchange were due to favorable results from the companys risk management services associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by Nicors energy related products and services businesses. Lower revenues at Nicors energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Corporate and eliminations reflects primarily the elimination of gas distribution revenues against Nicor Solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products and Nicor Enerchange net revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy. Gas distribution margin. Nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues. Gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs, which are passed directly through to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, and revenue taxes, for which Nicor Gas earns a small administrative fee. These items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues, with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense, with no direct impact on gas distribution margin. The 2009 rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs. Ad ditionally, in February 2010 the ICC approved the companys bad debt rider. As a result, changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these riders are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense. A reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution revenues $ 2,204.4 $ 2,140.8 $ 3,206.9 Cost of gas (1,364.1 ) (1,345.7 ) (2,427.8 ) Revenue tax expense (145.9 ) (148.1 ) (171.1 ) Gas distribution margin $ 694.4 $ 647.0 $ 608.0 Gas distribution margin increased $47.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to revenue from the bad debt and energy efficiency riders ($32.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively) and the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $20 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather in 2010 (approximately $8 million decrease), lower interest on customer balances ($5.5 million decrease) and lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $4 million decrease). Gas distribution margin increased $39.0 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates (approximately $60 million increase), partially offset by warmer weather (approximately $8 million decrease), lower demand unrelated to weather (approximately $5 million decrease) and lower revenue from cost recovery riders (approximately $3 million decrease). Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense. Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense decreased $0.4 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.9 million decrease), lower pension expense ($4.6 million decrease, net of capitalization), lower billing and call center related costs ($2.9 million decrease), lower costs on legal matters ($2.6 million decrease), higher bad debt expense ($10.6 million increase) and higher costs associated with the energy efficiency program ($8.8 million increase). Bad debt expense in 2010 was $63.8 million compared to $53.2 million in the prior year. Bad debt expense in 2010 includes the recognition of the $31.7 million benefit associated with the net under recovery of bad debt expense from 2008 and 2009; $63.0 million of expense assumed to be collected through base rates; and $32.5 million of expense which is equal to the revenue recognized under the bad debt rider. 28 Table of Contents Gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased $5.8 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs ($26.5 million increase of which $21.8 million relates to higher pension expense, net of capitalization), the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs ($3.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to a 2007 investigation of the presence of PCBs in the companys distribution system and $1.9 million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom Nicor previously did business during the PBR timeframe), higher postage charges ($2.0 million increase) and higher costs on legal matters ($1.8 million increase). Partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense ($17.5 million decrease due to lower revenues attribu table principally to lower natural gas costs), lower company use and storage related gas costs ($7.3 million decrease) and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the 2009 rate orders ($5.7 million decrease). Other gas distribution operating expenses. In 2010 and 2008, the company recorded favorable (unfavorable) reserve adjustments of $1.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively, associated with the companys mercury inspection and repair program. Additional information about the companys mercury inspection and repair program is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Property sale gains and losses vary from year to year depending upon property sales activity. During 2010 and 2008, Nicor Gas realized pretax gains of $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The company periodically assesses its ownership of certain real estate holdings. Shipping operating expenses. Shipping operating expenses increased $7.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher transportation related costs ($8.7 million increase, largely attributable to higher fuel prices) and higher repairs and maintenance costs ($1.9 million increase), partially offset by lower charter costs ($3.6 million decrease) and lower payroll and benefit related costs ($2.0 million decrease). Shipping operating expenses decreased $62.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower transportation related costs ($36.9 million decrease, largely attributable to lower volumes shipped and fuel prices), charter costs ($10.1 million decrease) and payroll and benefit related costs ($5.8 million decrease). Other energy ventures operating expenses. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $9.5 million in 2010 compared to prior year due to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($11.4 million decrease) attributable to lower average cost per utility bill management contract resulting from lower average natural gas prices, partially offset by higher average contract volumes. Nicors other energy ventures operating expenses decreased $11.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses ($7.0 million decrease) and at Nicor Enerchange ($4.3 million decrease). The decrease in operating expenses at Nicors energy related products and services businesses was due to lower average costs associated with utility bill management contracts, partially offset by higher average contract volumes and higher selling, general and administrative costs attributable to business growth. The decrease in operating expenses at Nicor Enerchange was due primarily to lower transportat ion and storage charges attributable to lower natural gas prices. Other corporate expenses and eliminations. Other corporate operating expenses (income) were $6.8 million, $0.6 million and $(2.0) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in other corporate operating expenses for 2010 is $4.6 million of merger related costs. In 2008, Nicor recorded a benefit of $3.1 million related to recoveries of previously incurred legal costs. Also included in the amounts for all years presented are certain business development costs. 29 Table of Contents Intercompany eliminations were $(57.0) million, $(76.7) million and $(79.8) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and related primarily to utility bill management products. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $0.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower interest on income tax matters ($2.9 million decrease), higher bank commitment fees ($1.7 million increase) and higher average borrowing levels ($1.1 million increase). Interest expense decreased $1.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due to lower average interest rates ($5.3 million decrease), partially offset by the impact of higher interest on income tax matters ($1.9 million increase) and bank commitment fees ($1.5 million increase). Net equity investment income. Net equity investment income decreased $7.6 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due to the absence of a $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys 50 percent interest in EN Engineering in 2009, partially offset by an increase in income from the companys investment in Triton ($2.5 million increase). Net equity investment income increased $6.4 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the $10.1 million gain recognized on the sale of the companys interest in EN Engineering, partially offset by the absence of income from the companys investment in EN Engineering ($2.8 million decrease) and a decrease in income from the companys investment in Triton ($1.1 million decrease). Equity investment results include $7.8 million, $5.3 million and $6.4 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for Nicors share of income from Triton. Interest income. Interest income decreased $1.2 million in 2010 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower interest on tax matters ($1.1 million decrease). Interest income decreased $6.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of lower average interest rates ($2.5 million decrease), interest on tax matters ($2.2 million decrease) and average investment balances ($1.5 million decrease). Income tax expense. In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations. The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization. Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation. In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $2 3 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings. At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 33.5 percent, 32.4 percent and 27.0 percent for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies, partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments. The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Nicor Inc.

These resources include net cash flow from operating activities, access to capital markets, lines of credit and short term investments. Capital market conditions are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys ability to access capital. Operating cash flows. The gas distribution business is highly seasonal and operating cash flow may fluctuate significantly during the year and from year to year due to factors such as weather, natural gas prices, the timing of collections from customers, natural gas purchasing, and storage and hedging practices. The company relies on short term borrowings, backed by bank lines of credit, to meet seasonal increases in working capital needs. Cash requirements generally increase over the last half of the year due to increases in natural gas purchases, gas in storage and accounts receivable. During the first half of the year, positive cash flow generally results from the sale of gas in storage and the collection of accounts receivable. &#1 60;This cash is typically used to substantially reduce, or eliminate, short term debt during the first half of the year. Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions. These margin accounts may cause large fluctuations in cash needs or sources in a relatively short period of time due to daily settlements resulting from changes in natural gas futures prices. The company manages these fluctuations with short term borrowings and investments. Net cash flow provided from operating activities decreased $216.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the decrease in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2009/2010 heating season compared to the 2008/2009 heating season and include: a decrease of $178.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and a decrease of $102.8 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. In addition, the company had higher volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2010 when compared to 2009. Net cash flow provided from operating activities increased $598.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. The significant factors contributing to the increase in cash flow are primarily a result of lower average natural gas prices during the 2008/2009 heating season compared to the 2007/2008 heating season and include: an increase of $245.6 million from changes in receivables due to higher receivable balances at the end of 2008 versus 2009; and an increase of $238.6 million from changes in margin accounts related to derivative instruments due to the decline in gas prices. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the company had lower volumes of gas in storage at December 31, 2009 when compared to 2008. Investing activities. Net cash flow used for investing activities was $229.2 million, $211.5 million and $265.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is an internal measure utilized by management that represents cash additions to property, plant and equipment, adjusted for items including the accrual of work performed through period end and other non cash items, contributions in aid of construction and expenditures associated with asset retirement obligations. Capital expenditures by the companys major businesses are presented in the following table (in millions): Estimated 2011 2010 2009 2008 Gas distribution $ 205 $ 198 $ 203 $ 229 Shipping 26 15 22 17 Other energy ventures 129 28 6 4 $ 360 $ 241 $ 231 $ 250 Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009. Factors contributing to the decrease include lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $6 million decrease), lower facility construction (approximately $3 million decrease), lower capitalized overhead costs attributable to lower postretirement benefit costs (approximately $2 million decrease) and higher information technology improvements (approximately $8 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures decreased in 2009 versus 2008 due to the impact of lower customer additions (approximately $10 million decrease), information technology improvements (approximately $10 million decrease), facility construction (approximately $9 million decrease) and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements (approximately $7 million decrease), partially offset by higher capitalized overhead costs attributable to higher postretirement benefit costs (approximately $9 million increase). Gas distribution capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010. Factors contributing to the expected increase include higher expenditures associated with facility construction and new service additions and lower expenditures associated with gas distribution, transmission and storage system improvements. Shipping capital expenditures decreased in 2010 versus 2009 due to a decrease in progress payments on the construction of a new vessel. Shipping capital expenditures increased in 2009 versus 2008 due primarily to progress payments on the construction of a new vessel, partially offset by a decrease in facility expansion. Shipping capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 versus 2010 due primarily to increased expenditures related to freight handling equipment, containers and information technology system improvements. Other energy ventures capital expenditures increased in 2010 versus 2009 due primarily to expenditures related to the development of a natural gas storage facility by Central Valley (approximately $18 million increase). 33 Table of Contents Other energy ventures capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2011 by approximately $120 million due to the continued development of the storage facility by Central Valley. Included in these capital expenditures is conditioning gas, to ready the field for use, that is expected to be injected in 2011 and withdrawn and sold in 2012. Additional investing activities. Yearly fluctuations in additional investing activities include the following items: 2009 and 2008 reflect increased short term investments primarily at the companys shipping business. In March 2009, the company sold its 50 percent interest in EN Engineering and received cash of $13.0 million. Financing activities. Nicor and Nicor Gas access to financing at competitive rates is, in part, dependent on its credit ratings. The current credit ratings for Nicor Inc. and Nicor Gas are as follows: Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Nicor Inc. Commercial Paper A 1+ P 2 F 1 Senior Unsecured Debt AA n/a A Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a Nicor Gas Commercial Paper A 1+ P 1 F 1 Senior Secured Debt AA Aa3 AA Senior Unsecured Debt AA A2 A+ Corporate Credit Rating AA n/a n/a In December 2010, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch affirmed Nicor and Nicor Gas credit ratings. S&P changed Nicor and Nicor Gas outlooks from stable to credit watch with negative implications. Moodys affirmed Nicors outlook as stable, but changed Nicor Gas outlook from stable to negative. Fitch maintained the outlook as stable for both Nicor and Nicor Gas. Both S&P and Moodys attributed the change in outlook to the proposed merger with AGL Resources. Long term debt. The company typically uses the net proceeds from long term debt for refinancing outstanding debt, for construction programs (to the extent not provided by internally generated funds) and for general corporate purposes. In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011. In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired. In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million in First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement. In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds. 34 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had the capacity to issue approximately $470 million of additional First Mortgage Bonds under the terms of its indenture. On February 25, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a shelf registration with a $225 million capacity, which became effective on March 20, 2009. In 2010, Nicor entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long term fixed rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility. Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR. Nicor believes it is in compliance with its debt covenants. Nicors long term debt agreements do not include ratings triggers or material adverse change provisions. Short term debt. In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011, to replace the $550 million, 364 day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010. These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper. The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. &#1 60;During 2010, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $512 million to no commercial paper and averaged $269 million. During 2009, the commercial paper borrowing levels ranged from $759 million to $216 million and averaged $417 million. The average borrowing levels are calculated using average daily balances for each day for the year. The company expects that funding from commercial paper and related backup line of credit agreements will continue to be available in the foreseeable future and sufficient to meet estimated cash requirements. Common stock. Nicor maintained its quarterly common stock dividend rate during 2010 of $0.465 per common share. The company paid dividends on its common stock of $85.1 million, $84.8 million and $84.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter. Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nicor currently has a dividend reinvestment program that offers the opportunity to holders of Nicor common and preferred shares to purchase additional shares of Nicor common stock by reinvesting the dividends and or making direct cash purchases. Shares are acquired by Nicor on behalf of participants through purchases in the open market. Nicor amended the program in 2009 to allow Nicor to issue new shares of common stock as an alternative to purchasing them in the open market. Any proceeds from newly issued shares may be used for advances to or equity investments in its subsidiaries, for other investment opportunities, or for general corporate purposes. No new shares have been issued since the program was amended in 2009. In 2001, Nicor announced a $50 million common stock repurchase program, under which Nicor may purchase its common stock as market conditions permit through open market transactions and to the extent cash flow is available after other cash needs and investment opportunities. There were no repurchases under this program since 2002. As of December 31, 2010, $21.5 million remained authorized for the repurchase of common stock. Preferred Stock. In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends. As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010. In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share. Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption. 35 Table of Contents Off balance sheet arrangements. Nicor has certain guarantees, as further described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19 Guarantees and Indemnities. The company believes the likelihood of any such payment under these guarantees is remote. No liability has been recorded for these guarantees. Contractual obligations. At December 31, 2010, Nicor had contractual obligations with payments due as follows (in millions): Payments due by period Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Purchase obligations $ 480.8 $ 264.8 $ 32.1 $ 5.2 $ 782.9 Long term debt 75.0 425.0 500.0 Fixed interest on long term debt 26.1 51.3 51.3 342.7 471.4 Operating leases 17.5 14.7 5.3 11.5 49.0 $ 599.4 $ 330.8 $ 88.7 $ 784.4 $ 1,803.3 In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table above, Nicor has potential liabilities to taxing authorities (unrecognized tax benefits) which are dependent on the resolution of particular income tax positions. The timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with such potential liabilities is uncertain. The company had accrued a liability for estimated unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million at December 31, 2010, for which the amount and timing of payments is uncertain. The company also has long term obligations for postretirement benefits which are not included in the above table. Information regarding the companys obligations for postretirement benefits can be found in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits. Purchase obligations consist primarily of natural gas purchase agreements, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts in the gas distribution and wholesale natural gas marketing businesses. Natural gas purchase agreements include obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using NYMEX futures prices as of December 31, 2010. Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the other energy ventures. Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment. Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million. OTHER MATTERS Storage Projects. Central Valley is developing an underground natural gas storage facility in the Sacramento River valley of north central California and plans to provide approximately 11 Bcf of working natural gas capacity, offering flexible, high deliverability multi cycle services and interconnection to a regional pipeline. In October 2010, the CPUC approved Central Valleys Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct and operate the storage facility. Central Valley plans to initiate construction activity during the first quarter of 2011 and expects completion during the fourth quarter of 2011, with firm storage services commencing in early 20 12. The company estimates the net capital cost for the Central Valley project to be approximately $120 million. 36 Table of Contents Nicor is also participating in a natural gas storage development joint venture known as Sawgrass Storage. In 2010, Sawgrass Storage initiated the pre filing process with the FERC. Application for Approval of Energy Efficiency Plan. On September 29, 2010, Nicor Gas filed an application with the ICC seeking approval of an energy efficiency plan. The filing was made pursuant to an Illinois law enacted in 2009 that requires local gas distribution utilities to establish plans to achieve specified energy savings goals beginning in June 2011 and provides utilities with a rider to collect the costs of the plan from customers. Under its proposed plan, the company estimates that it would bill nearly $100 million to customers under the rider, over a three year period commencing June 1, 2011, to fund the costs of various energy savings programs identified in the companys filing. Petition for Re approval of Operating Agreement. On July 1, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a petition seeking re approval from the ICC of the operating agreement that governs many inter company transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates. The petition was filed pursuant to a requirement contained in the ICC order approving the companys most recent general rate increase and requested that the operating agreement be re approved without change. A number of parties have intervened in the proceeding and are seeking modifications on a prospective basis to the operating agreement. Among the proposals are several by the ICC Staff and intervenors that would preclude Nicor Gas from continuing to provide certain services to support warranty produc ts that are sold by Nicor Services. Specifically, Nicor Services currently uses Nicor Gas personnel to assist in some sales solicitation for these warranty products and to provide repair services for some of these products. Nicor Gas does not believe these proposed modifications are appropriate and is opposing them. If these proposed modifications to the operating agreement are approved by the ICC, it would require changes in the way Nicor Services provides its warranty products and could adversely impact the future profitability of these products. As the ICC will be required to evaluate future transactions between Nicor Gas and its affiliates in connection with the joint application of AGL Resources, Nicor and Nicor Gas for approval of the merger of AGL Resources and Nicor, Nicor Gas has a motion pending with the ICC to suspend this proceeding. Financial Reform Legislation. Financial Reform Legislation was enacted into law on July 21, 2010, and includes a provision that requires certain over the counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared and also includes provisions under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may impose collateral requirements. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation will be established through rulemakings. While the company does not currently believe the legislation will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, the company will continue to evaluate the legislation and future rulemakings. Synthetic Natural Gas Plant Legislation. In January 2011, the Illinois House and Senate passed legislation regarding two proposed synthetic natural gas plants. Unless vetoed by the governor, the legislation will go into effect no later than March 15, 2011 and will require Nicor Gas and other major Illinois natural gas utilities to either: (a) submit to rate cases in 2011, 2013 and 2015, or (b) purchase under long term contracts (30 years for one plant and 10 years for the other) natural gas from the plants at a cost that may exceed the market price of natural gas. The legislation would allow Nicor Gas to recover the gas costs, and any related transportation costs, through the PGA without any further prudence review. Other. Restrictions imposed by regulatory agencies and loan agreements limiting the amount of subsidiary net assets that can be transferred to Nicor are not expected to have a material impact on the companys ability to meet its cash obligations. 37 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Nicors 2011 outlook assumes weather based on historical patterns, but excludes, among other things, the impact (including any merger and integration costs incurred in 2011) of the proposed merger with AGL Resources and the ICCs PBR plan/PGA review, other contingencies or future changes in tax law. The companys outlook also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments at Nicor Enerchange and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. While these items could materially affect 2011 earnings, they are currently not estimable. Gas distribution. Nicor Gas estimated operating results will decrease in 2011 as the result of the absence of the prior year $32 million pretax benefit attributable to the ICCs approval of the companys bad debt rider, higher operating and maintenance costs and higher depreciation expense. The company estimates that a 100 degree day variation from normal weather affects Nicor Gas distribution margin, net of income taxes, by approximately $1.3 million. The consolidated impact, however, is generally reduced somewhat because of the natural weather hedge attributable to the utility bill management products offered by certain of Nicors other energy ventures. Shipping. Tropical Shippings 2011 operating results are estimated to be higher than 2010 as a result of estimated increases in base rates and cost reduction initiatives. The company also continues to expect relatively low tax costs on operating earnings in 2011 attributable to the 2006 reorganization of certain shipping and related operations. Other energy ventures. The company expects 2011 operating results from its other energy ventures to be similar to 2010s. Other. The company also expects 2011 net income to be adversely impacted by the absence of favorable tax reserve adjustments recognized in 2010 and higher state income taxes. CONTINGENCIES The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition. Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition. PBR plan. Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003. Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market sensitive benchmark. Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers. The PBR plan is currently under ICC review. There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations. On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proce edings). As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery. The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter. In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff. The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan. The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan. 38 Table of Contents In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation. The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002. A copy of the Report is available at the Nicor website and has been previously produced to all parties in the ICC Proceedings. In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls. The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability. Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency. A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million. Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan. In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties. By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls. Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999 2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review. On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings. In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false. Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers. On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions. On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions. CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings. It is not possible to deter mine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings. In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan. Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above. The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT. In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007. In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007. In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively. No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter. Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder. Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Litigation relating to proposed merger. Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.). The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Co ok County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 10, 2010; Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 13, 2010; Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al., filed December 17, 2010; and Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al., filed December 17, 2010). The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders. The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages. On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated. Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. The final disposition of these shareholder litigation related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition. Mercury. Information about mercury contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Mercury. Manufactured gas plant sites. The company is conducting environmental investigations and remedial activities at former manufactured gas plant sites. Additional information about these sites is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Manufactured Gas Plant Sites. Municipal tax matters. Information about municipal tax contingencies is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Municipal Tax Matters. Other. The company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. See Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies Other. 40 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Nicor prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which regularly require Nicors management to exercise judgment in the selection and application of accounting methods. The application of accounting methods includes making estimates using subjective assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The use of estimates and the selection of accounting policies affect Nicors reported results and financial condition. The company has adopted several significant accounting policies and is required to make significant accounting estimates that are important to understanding its financial statements. These significant policies and estimates are described throughout Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there are numerous areas in which Nicors management makes significant accounting estimates, it believes its critical estimates are those that require managements most difficult and subjective or complex judgments. Nicors management has a practice of reviewing its critical accounting estimates and policy decisions with the audit committee of its board of directors. Its critical estimates typically involve loss contingencies, derivative instruments, pension and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, credit risk, unbilled revenues and regulatory assets and liabilities because they are estimates which could materially impact Nicors financial statements. Loss contingencies. Nicor and its subsidiaries record contingent losses as liabilities when a loss is both probable and the amount or range of loss, including related legal defense costs, is reasonably estimable. When only a range of potential loss is estimable, the company records a liability for the minimum anticipated loss. Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and are exposed to various loss contingencies. These loss contingencies are in some cases resolved in stages over time, estimates may change significantly from period to period, and the companys ultimate obligations may differ materiall y from its recorded amounts. Of particular note is the PBR plan contingency at Nicor Gas described in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 20 Contingencies. Derivative instruments. The rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are numerous and complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in managements assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions or new interpretations of accounting rules. As a result, management judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedg e effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment. These determinations and changes in estimates may have a material impact on reported results. Pension and other postretirement benefits. The companys cost of providing postretirement benefits is dependent upon various factors and assumptions, including life expectancies, the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, the long term rate of compensation increase and anticipated health care costs. Actual experience in any one period, particularly the actual return on plan assets, often varies significantly from these mostly long term assumptions. When cumulatively significant, the gains and losses generated from such variances are amortized into operating income over the remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans (approximately 9 years for the pen sion plan and 12 years for the health care plan). Additional information is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10 Postretirement Benefits, including plan asset investment allocation, estimated future benefit payments, general descriptions of the plans, significant assumptions, the impact of certain changes in assumptions and significant changes in estimates. 41 Table of Contents The companys postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) included in operating income was $19.6 million, $24.6 million and $2.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company expects to record postretirement benefit expense (net of capitalization) for 2011 of $18.7 million. Significant market declines in the values of plan assets in 2008 caused the increase in postretirement benefit expense for the years after 2008. Actuarial assumptions affecting 2011 include an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25 percent and discount rates of 5.40 percent for the companys defined benefit pension plan and 5.20 percent for the health care and other benefits plans, compared with an 8.25 percent rate of return on plan assets and discount rates of 5.45 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively, in the prior year. Nicor Gas establishes its expected long term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management. Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability based models. The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching st udy using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread. The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market. The discount rate is critical to the measurement of the plans costs. Additionally, the assumed rate of return on plan assets is critical to the determination of the pension plans cost. The following table illustrates the effect of a one percentage point change in these actuarial assumptions on 2010s net benefit cost (in millions): Actuarial assumption Increase (decrease) Effect on net benefit cost Discount rate 1.0 % $(6.2 ) (1.0 %) 7.4 Rate of return on plan assets 1.0 % (3.5 ) (1.0 %) 3.5 Income taxes. A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination. Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability. The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. The evaluation is based on a two step approach. The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Changes between what the company recognizes as an unrecognized tax benefit and what is actually settled with the taxing authority could be materially different. Credit risk. The company is required to estimate counterparty credit risk in estimating the fair values of certain derivative instruments. The companys counterparties consist primarily of major energy companies and financial institutions. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact the companys exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one cou nterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. 42 Table of Contents However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this uncertainty, actual losses relating to credit risk could materially vary from Nicors estimates. The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments. Such estimates are based on historical experience, existing economic conditions and certain collection related patterns. Circumstances which could affect these estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, natural gas prices, customer deposits and economic conditions. Actual credit losses could vary materially from Nicors estimates. Nicors allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $27.6 million, $33.0 million and $44.9 million, respectively, as presented on Schedule II in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules. The impact of credit losses to Nicors results of o perations is substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider that was approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year. Unbilled revenues. Nicor Gas accrues revenues for natural gas deliveries not yet billed to customers from the last billing date to month end. Accrued unbilled revenue estimates are dependent upon a number of customer usage factors which require management judgment, including weather factors. These estimates are adjusted when actual billings occur, and variances in estimates can be material. Accrued unbilled revenues for Nicor Gas at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $141.8 million and $137.7 million, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities. Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois. As a rate regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures. If Nicor Gas operations become no longe r subject to rate regulation, a write off of net regulatory liabilities would be required. Additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities is presented in Item 8 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Accounting Policies. 43 Table of Contents CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document includes certain forward looking statements about the expectations of Nicor and its subsidiaries and affiliates. Although Nicor believes these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may vary materially from stated expectations. Such forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, planned, potential, should, will, would, project, estimate, ultimate, or similar phrases. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the companys forward looking statements due, among other things, to the outcome of the proposed merger between Nicor and AGL Resources, the direct or indirect effects of legal contingencies (including litigation) and the resolution of those issues, including the effects of an ICC review, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Nicor is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations, including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and fuel commodity prices and interest rates. Nicors practice is to manage these risks utilizing derivative instruments and other methods, as deemed appropriate. Commodity price risk. With regard to commodity price risk, the company has established policies and procedures with respect to the management of such risks and the use of derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to such risks. Company management oversees compliance with such policies and procedures. Nicors other energy businesses utilize various techniques to limit, measure and monitor market risk, including limits based on volume, dollar amounts, maturity, and in some cases value at risk (VaR). VaR is a tool to assess the potential loss for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors, for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level. The company has established exposure limits at such a level that material adverse economic results are not expected. The companys commodity price risk policies and procedures continue to evolve with its businesses and are subject to ongoing review and modification. In accordance with SEC disclosure requirements, Nicor performs sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in earnings based upon a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices. Management does not believe that sensitivity analyses alone provide an accurate or reliable method for monitoring and controlling risks and therefore also relies on the experience and judgment of its management to revise strategies and adjust positions as deemed necessary. Losses in excess of the amounts determined in sensitivity analyses could occur if market prices exceed the 10 percent shift used for the analyses. As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas exposure to market risk caused by changes in commodity prices is substantially mitigated because of Illinois rate regulation allowing for the recovery of prudently incurred natural gas supply costs from customers. However, substantial changes in natural gas prices may impact Nicor Gas earnings by increasing or decreasing the cost of gas used by the company, storage related gas costs, and other operating and financing expenses. The company expects to purchase in 2011 about 2 Bcf of natural gas for its own use and to cover storage related gas costs. The volume of natural gas purchased by the company, which is exposed to market risk, has declined over the last two years as a result of certain changes approved in the 2009 rate orders. The level of natu ral gas prices may also impact customer gas consumption and therefore gas distribution margin. The actual impact of natural gas price fluctuations on Nicor Gas earnings is dependent upon several factors, including the companys hedging practices. The company generally hedges its forecasted company use and storage related gas costs through the use of swap agreements. Nicors other energy businesses are subject to natural gas commodity price risk, arising primarily from purchase and sale agreements, transportation agreements, natural gas inventories and utility bill management contracts. Derivative instruments such as futures, options, forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks. Based on Nicors other energy businesses unhedged positions at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent adverse change in natural gas prices would have decreased Nicors earnings for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by about $0.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Nicors other energy businesses entered into derivative instruments to hedge the natural gas commodity price risk associated with its forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the Central Valley natural gas storage facility. At December 31, 2010, these derivatives totaled approximately 1.4 Bcf and had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million. Gains and losses on these derivatives are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold. 45 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, Nicor Enerchange, Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, held derivative contracts with the following net asset (liability) fair values (in millions): Maturity Source of Fair Value Total Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years Prices actively quoted $ (8.3 ) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.6 ) Prices correlated to external sources 28.2 18.9 9.3 Prices based on models and other valuation methods (6.9 ) (5.2 ) (1.7 ) Total $ 13.0 $ 9.0 $ 4.0 Actively quoted prices are for those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX. Nicor Enerchange enters into over the counter derivative instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange traded instruments in active markets. Nicor Enerchange uses one or more significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices. Tropical Shippings objective is to substantially mitigate its exposure to higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges. Credit risk. The company has a diversified customer base, which limits its exposure to concentrations of credit risk in any one industry or income class and believes that it maintains prudent credit policies. Additionally, the gas distribution business offers options to help customers manage their bills, such as energy assistance programs for low income customers and a budget payment plan that spreads gas bills more evenly throughout the year. This risk has been substantially mitigated by the bad debt rider approved by the ICC on February 2, 2010. The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expe nse included in its rates for the respective year. The company is also exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty, customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed upon terms and conditions. To manage this credit risk, the company believes it maintains prudent credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties. In doing so, the company seeks guarantees or collateral, in the form of cash or letters of credit, acquires credit insurance in certain instances, limits its exposure to any one counterparty, and, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. However, the volatility in the capital markets over the past three years has made it more difficult for the company to assess the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Based on this u ncertainty, the company has taken additional steps including, but not limited to, reducing available credit to some of its counterparties. Interest rate risk. Nicor is exposed to changes in interest rates. The company manages its interest rate risk by issuing primarily fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities, refinancing certain debt and, at times, hedging the interest rate on anticipated borrowings. At December 31, 2010, if market rates were to hypothetically increase by 10 percent from Nicors weighted average floating interest rate on commercial paper, interest expense would have increased causing Nicors earnings to decrease by less than $0.1 million in 2010. Nicor holds forward starting interest rate swaps maturing in 2012 with a notional totaling $90 million. These swaps had a net liability fair value of $2.2 million at December 31, 2010 . The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices that correlate to external sources. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until settlement and then amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt.
