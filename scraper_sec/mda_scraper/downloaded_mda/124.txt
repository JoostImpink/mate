Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. In 2004, the Company adopted a policy to change its fiscal year to a calendar year, effective with the calendar year commencing January 1, 2005. Prior to fiscal year 2005, the Companys 52/53 week fiscal year ended on the Friday closest to the last day of December. Fiscal year ends 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2002 were 52 week years while fiscal year 2003 was a 53 week year. Fiscal year ends were as follows: 2006 December 31, 2006 2005 December 31, 2005 2004 December 31, 2004 2003 January 2, 2004 2002 December 27, 2002 13 Table of Contents Selected Financial Data (in thousands, except per share data) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 118,935 $ 110,897 $ 101,515 $ 96,415 $ 104,383 Gross profit 38,145 33,705 27,723 29,397 33,145 Selling, general and administrative expense 28,641 27,717 28,371 28,635 29,178 Non recurring gain on termination of benefit plan 9,258 Minority interest 151 Operating income 9,504 5,988 8,610 762 3,816 Net income (loss) $ 4,114 $ 2,380 $ 4,618 $ (360 ) $ (1,050 ) Cash Flow Cash provided by operations $ 4,560 $ 12,285 $ 4,200 $ 2,589 $ 12,450 Capital expenditures $ 5,377 $ 3,062 $ 2,009 $ 2,227 $ 3,481 Adjusted working capital (1) $ 23,326 $ 20,709 $ 23,789 $ 24,834 $ 20,955 Total assets $ 72,768 $ 67,753 $ 69,370 $ 76,407 $ 77,576 Current portion of long term debt $ 4,745 $ 4,138 $ 7,605 $ 53 $ 18,363 Long term debt, less current portion 23,884 25,829 16,708 25,371 5,436 Total debt $ 28,629 $ 29,967 $ 24,313 $ 25,424 $ 23,799 Shareholders equity $ 26,546 $ 21,518 $ 29,735 $ 25,418 $ 26,413 Per Share Data Basic net income (loss) $ 1.10 $ 0.48 $ 0.89 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.20 ) Diluted net income (loss) $ 1.05 $ 0.48 $ 0.89 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.20 ) Cash dividends paid $ 0.18 $ 0.00 $ 0.27 $ 0.36 $ 0.36 Weighted average dilutive shares outstanding 3,929 4,961 5,166 5,180 5,232 (1) Adjusted working capital is total current assets less current liabilities excluding the current portion of long term debt shown above. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of mechanical and electronic products used in the process of power transmission for industrial and other commercial applications. Fiscal year 2006 continued to reflect strong demand in the Companys marketplace, particularly for its Mechanical Division products, experienced by the Company beginning in 2004 following a prolonged slump in the industrial markets that began in the second half of 2000. The favorable economic conditions have permitted the Company to be able to continue a disciplined strategy of price increases. In addition, costs for the Companys primary raw materials, principally the costs of scrap steel and ancillary steel based components used in the manufacture of its mechanical products, remained fairly stable throughout 2006 and 2005 following a period of significant volatility and upward cost pressure that occurred in 2004. The Company continued to address other cost reduction activities through expanded lean manufacturing initiatives. Together, these matters contributed to continued improvement in overall profitability for the Company in 2006. 14 Table of Contents The following tables, derived from the Companys audited consolidated financial statements, present selected elements of the Companys operating results, and the changes thereto, for each of the two most recent years compared to the results for the immediately preceding year. Year ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands) 2006 2005 Dollar Change % Change Sales Mechanical Business $ 79,773 $ 72,361 $ 7,412 10.2 % Electronics Business 39,162 38,536 626 1.6 % Total Sales $ 118,935 $ 110,897 $ 8,038 7.2 % Cost of Sales Mechanical Business $ 55,512 $ 52,213 $ 3,299 6.3 % Electronics Business 25,278 24,979 299 1.2 % Total Cost of Sales $ 80,790 $ 77,192 $ 3,598 4.7 % Gross Profit Mechanical Business $ 24,261 $ 20,148 $ 4,113 20.4 % Electronics Business 13,884 13,557 327 2.4 % Total Gross Profit $ 38,145 $ 33,705 $ 4,440 13.2 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 28,641 $ 27,717 $ 924 3.3 % Sales as a percentage of total sales Mechanical Business 67.1 % 65.3 % Electronics Business 32.9 % 34.7 % Total Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Sales as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 69.6 % 72.2 % Electronics Business 64.5 % 64.8 % Total Cost of Sales 67.9 % 69.6 % Gross Profit as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 30.4 % 27.8 % Electronics Business 35.5 % 35.2 % Total Gross Profit 32.1 % 30.4 % SGA Expense as a percentage of total sales 24.1 % 25.0 % Consolidated revenues increased in 2006 by $8.0 million, or 7.2%, with the Companys largest distributor buying $1.5 million, or 8.0% more than in 2005. Overall sales volume growth provided $4.7 million of the increase; product mix and pricing, net of rebates, accounted for $2.5 million; and currency gain contributed $0.8 million. This revenue gain was largely from the Mechanical Business where sales increased 10.2% or $7.4 million over fiscal 2005. Higher volume contributed $4.3 million of this gain; improved pricing added $2.6 million; and $0.5 million of the increase was caused by the favorable effects of the Canadian currency. Electronic Business revenue increased $0.6 million or 1.6% over fiscal 2005, with $0.4 million of this gain from higher volume and $0.2 million increase as a result of favorable currency, largely due to a stronger Euro. The Companys gross profit increased in 2006 by $4.4 million to $38.1 million. Because gross profit increased at a higher rate than sales, gross margin expressed as a percent of net sales rose from 30.4% to 32.1%. Our Mechanical Business was the main contributor to the gross profit rise with a $4.1 million increase in gross profit. Higher volume contributed $2.1 million while favorable pricing provided $2.5 million. This favorable outcome was partly offset by an increase in energy and other costs of operations. Electronic Business gross margin increased by $0.3 million or 2.4%, principally as a result of $0.2 million of higher volume and $0.1 million favorable Euro currency effect. In 2006, selling, general and administrative costs increased $0.9 million compared to 2005, but declined from 25.0% to 24.1% measured as a percentage of net sales. Higher management incentive accruals of $0.5 million and increased freight costs of $0.3 million associated with higher volumes were principal causes of increased SGA costs in 2006. 15 Table of Contents Interest expense and other finance charges increased $1.3 million to $3.6 million compared to the prior year. This increase was principally caused by higher average debt levels and interest rates attributable to the Companys senior subordinated debt arrangements finalized in October of 2005. The Companys income tax rates are lower than statutory rates primarily due to certain income tax credits. The income tax provision for the full year 2006 was $0.5 million higher than amounts provided in the prior year primarily due to increased pre tax profits. As a result of the above, 2006 net income was $4.1 million, or $1.05 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. Diluted net income per share in 2006 increased due to higher income, as well as a lower number of outstanding shares resulting from the Companys buy back of 1.5 million shares in October 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 (in thousands) 2005 2004 Dollar Change % Change Sales Mechanical Business $ 72,361 $ 63,732 $ 8,629 13.5 % Electronics Business 38,536 37,783 753 2.0 % Total Sales $ 110,897 $ 101,515 $ 9,382 9.2 % Cost of Sales Mechanical Business $ 52,213 $ 47,788 $ 4,425 9.3 % Electronics Business 24,979 26,004 (1,025 ) (3.9 %) Total Cost of Sales $ 77,192 $ 73,792 $ 3,400 4.6 % Gross Profit Mechanical Business $ 20,148 $ 15,944 $ 4,204 26.4 % Electronics Business 13,557 11,779 1,778 15.1 % Total Gross Profit $ 33,705 $ 27,723 $ 5,982 21.6 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 27,717 $ 28,371 $ (654 ) (2.3 %) Sales as a percentage of total sales Mechanical Business 65.3 % 62.8 % Electronics Business 34.7 % 37.2 % Total Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Sales as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 72.2 % 75.0 % Electronics Business 64.8 % 68.8 % Total Cost of Sales 69.6 % 72.7 % Gross Profit as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 27.8 % 25.0 % Electronics Business 35.2 % 31.2 % Total Gross Profit 30.4 % 27.3 % SGA Expense as a percentage of total sales 25.0 % 27.9 % The continuing strength in general economic conditions during 2005 helped the Company experience a $9.4 million increase in revenues compared to 2004. The revenue growth can be attributed to three major factors: increased demand or volume for the Companys products, increased prices for those products, and foreign currency fluctuations relative to the United States dollar and the local currency utilized by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The Companys Mechanical Division experienced increased selling volume of $5.8 million, which accounted for nearly two thirds of its total revenue growth. The Company believes that the strong economic recovery, buoyed in part by the market for the Companys products used in oil production, contributed substantially to this increased demand. The Company was also able to increase prices in 2005 for certain of its Mechanical products, contributing approximately $2.1 million to increased revenues for the year. The remainder of the Mechanical Division sales growth related to a stronger Canadian dollar. The Company also experienced a $0.6 million increase in sales of its electronic products 16 Table of Contents attributable to increased sales of products used to produce petroleum and the successful introduction of the Companys new X 4AC drive. The remaining increase in sales revenues related to minor price changes and currency fluctuations. Overall gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 30.4% in 2005 compared to 27.3 % in 2004. This gain can be attributed to $2.0 million of price increases, or 1.9 points, and the absence in 2005 of $1.5 million in non recurring closure costs associated with the closure of the Trenton facility incurred in 2004, or 1.4 points. Gains from currency of approximately $0.3 million and reduced LIFO costs of $0.8 million were largely offset by the higher cost of goods sold for products produced in previous years being recognized in 2005, as the Company made substantial reductions in its inventories from prior year levels. Gross profits of the Companys Mechanical Division increased approximately $4.2 million, to 27.8% of sales in 2005 compared to 25.0% of sales in 2004, principally due to selling price increases, higher sales volume levels and the elimination of the non recurring costs described above, offset by the effects of increased sales of lower margin products, and higher unit costs of goods sold in the current period attributable to goods made in previous years. 2005 production levels were kept lower than sales volume in order to reduce investment in inventory, which declined by $3.4 million. The Electronic Business gross profit increased $1.8 million, to 35.2% of sales compared to 31.2% of sales in 2004. The 4.0 points of margin improvement can be attributable primarily to a lower overall production cost structure, as the Company realized a full year of reduced unit costs attributable to cost savings initiatives undertaken in the second half of 2004. In addition, minor sales volume and product mix gains contributed approximately 1.0 point to this margin improvement. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined $0.7 million in 2005 compared to the previous fiscal year. Due to increased revenue levels, the above decline in these costs resulted in selling, general and administrative expenses being 25.0% of sales in 2005 compared to 27.9% of sales in 2004. The primary reason for the lower costs in 2005 was the $1.1 million decrease in salaries and benefit costs in 2005 principally resulting from restructuring of corporate sales and marketing costs in the second half of 2004, and a $0.3 million decrease in insurance costs. The effects of these cost savings initiatives were offset by the elimination of $0.6 million of amortized gains recognized in 2004 prior to the termination of the Companys post employment healthcare insurance program in the fourth quarter of 2004, and to a lesser extent $0.3 million in management incentive expense recognized in 2005 related to overall improved operating performance. In 2004, the Company continued steps to maintain total healthcare spending at affordable levels. In connection with these efforts, when the Company announced the termination of its post employment healthcare benefit plan in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a pre tax gain aggregating $9.3 million. This item is presented as a non recurring gain in the Companys income statement for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company also recorded $3.6 million deferred tax expense arising from the reduction of a previously recognized deferred tax asset associated with these benefits, resulting in a $1.09 increase in earnings per share in 2004 associated with the plan termination gain. Interest expense increased to $2.3 million in 2005 compared to $1.6 million in 2004. In January 2005, the Company refinanced its variable rate secured revolving credit and term loan agreement, and amended the agreement in July 2005, when the Company extended the agreement for an additional two years to April 2009. This new agreement carries higher stated interest rates. In addition, in October 2005, the Company completed a self tender offer to acquire 1.5 million shares of the Companys then outstanding common stock. This transaction was funded under the terms of a securities purchase agreement whereby the Company obtained $15.0 million from the sale of 12% fixed rate unsecured notes and detachable warrants to acquire shares of Companys common stock. Approximately $0.4 million of increased interest costs can be attributable to the higher secured credit agreement stated rates, as well as general market rate interest cost changes. The remaining $0.3 million increase in interest costs can be attributable to the terms of the unsecured credit agreement. The Companys effective tax rate increased to 35% of pre tax income in 2005, compared to a rate of 34% for 2004, each approximating the statutory rates. After taking into consideration all of the above matters, net income for 2005 was $2.4 million, or $0.48 per share on both a basic and diluted basis. This compares to a net income for 2004 of $4.6 million, or $0.89 per share. After taking into account $5.7 million of non recurring gain related to the termination of the Companys post employment healthcare benefit plan, described above, the Company would have had a net loss of $1.1 million in 2004 on a pro forma basis. 17 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies This discussion and analysis is based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this document. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, post retirement benefits, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see Note 2 to the attached Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, current economic trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies include: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The majority of the Companys accounts receivable are due from selected authorized industrial distributors who resell the Companys products to OEMs and end users for replacement parts. Accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and are stated at amounts due from the customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligations to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowances for doubtful accounts. Product Warranty: In the ordinary course of business, the Company warrants its products against defect in design, materials, and workmanship over various time periods. Warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon managements best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. The warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is not significant to the financial position of the Company for all periods presented. Inventory: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the last in first out basis for a majority of US inventories and the first in first out method for all remaining inventories. The Company has recorded a reserve for obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets: The Company periodically evaluates the realizable value of long lived assets including property, plant and equipment, relying on a number of factors including operating results, budgets, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. The Companys past business acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill, which may result in future impairment expenses. The Companys other intangible assets which primarily consist of product application software, affects the amount of future period amortization expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition: The Companys revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer, the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Company establishes allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts, sales discounts, product warranty and returns based upon historical experience. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included as a component of net sales. 18 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Under the requirements of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, which, if actual experience varies, could result in material adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as follows (dollars in thousands): Less More Contractual Obligations in Than 1 1 3 3 5 Than 5 Thousands Total Year Years Years Years Long Term Debt Obligations $ 29,300 $ 4,744 $ 4,036 $ 147 $ 20,373 Operating Lease Obligations 4,720 1,093 1,505 1,072 1,050 Total $ 34,020 $ 5,837 $ 5,541 $ 1,219 $ 21,423 At December 31, 2006, current and long term debt totaled approximately $28.6 million, net of $0.7 million of unamortized discount, compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2005, and was comprised of $1.1 million and $7.3 million in revolving and term debt, respectively, under a senior secured credit facility; $5.3 million in tax exempt revenue bonds; and $0.6 million of principally foreign revolving and term credits, together with $14.3 million of unsecured subordinated term debt. The Companys effective borrowing rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 for its long term obligations were approximately 9.93% and 9.49%, respectively. The Companys senior secured loan and security agreement, as amended (the Loan Agreement) provides for up to an $18.3 million revolving line of credit and a term loan totaling $7.3 million as of December 31, 2006. The line of credit portion of the Loan Agreement includes existing letters of credit that support $5.3 million of industrial revenue bonds and approximately $1.7 million of obligations under various self insured workers compensation insurance policies. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys domestic assets and pledges of 65% of the outstanding stock of the Companys Canadian, German and Mexican subsidiaries. The Loan Agreement expires in April 2009. All borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear variable interest of a margin plus LIBOR or U.S. Prime Rate, and the term loan is repayable in equal monthly principal installments totaling $1.5 million annually. The average borrowing rates for the Companys short term borrowings under the senior secured credit arrangement at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were 7.86% and 7.97% respectively. At December 31, 2006 the Company had remaining borrowing capacity of $8.3 million. The Loan Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that require the Company to comply with certain financial tests including, among other things, maintaining minimum tangible net worth, having a minimum earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and meeting certain specified leverage and operating ratios, all as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also contains other restrictive covenants that restrict outside investments, capital expenditures, and dividends. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. The Company previously borrowed approximately $3.0 million and $2.3 million by issuing Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the industrial development corporations of the City of San Marcos, Texas and City of Chattanooga, Tennessee, respectively. These bonds bear variable interest rates (3.77% at December 31, 2006) and mature in April 2024 and April 2022. The bonds were issued to finance production facilities for the Companys manufacturing operations located in those cities, and are secured by letters of credit issued under the terms of the Companys Loan Agreement. On October 20, 2005, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for the issuance of $15.0 million of senior subordinated notes valued at $14.24 million and detachable warrants, valued at $0.76 million, to purchase 174,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The senior subordinated notes have a stated rate of 12% (approximate effective rate of 13%), are due on October 12, 2012, and contain customary financial covenants similar to, but less restrictive than, the Companys senior secured bank indebtedness described above. The proceeds from the sale of the notes and detachable warrants were used to acquire 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock at a purchase price of $11.25 million, repay approximately $2.0 million of term debt under the Companys senior secured borrowing agreement, pay $1.0 million of transaction costs related to the stock purchase and related financing transaction, with the balance providing additional working capital. 19 Table of Contents In addition to the above borrowing arrangements, $0.4 million at December 31, 2006 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2005 were outstanding under the terms of an unsecured revolving credit facility and a term loan, each borrowed by the Companys Italian subsidiary. Interest only was payable on the term loan during 2004, and principal repayments commenced beginning in 2005. The rates for these loans ranged from 1.3% to 3.9%. The Company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years. During 2006, the Company generated $4.6 million cash from operating activities, which compares to $12.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for this fluctuation was $2.4 million of increased cash flow from operating results, offset by $10.1 million of decreased cash flow from additional investment in working capital and other operating assets in 2006 compared to 2005. The major reason for the 2006 decrease in cash generated from operating results was the Company using $4.1 million of cash to increase inventory in 2006, compared to positive cash flow generated of $4.8 million from reducing inventory in 2005. Management currently expects that inventory will grow moderately in 2007 in line with demand, while at the same time the Company works to further improve inventory turns through better processes and lean manufacturing initiatives. The Company used $5.5 million and $2.5 million for investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This spending was primarily for capital expenditures of $5.4 million in 2006 and $3.1 million in 2005. The Companys capital investments have been maintained to allow for improvements in operating efficiencies and product quality. In 2007, the Company plans to spend $4.1 million on capital improvements for continued improvement in operating efficiencies and normal capital maintenance projects. The amount of commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2006 was not significant. Cash used in financing activities declined to $2.1 million in 2006 compared to $6.7 million in 2005. Principal uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 included $1.5 million of scheduled repayments of senior secured term debt and payment of $0.7 million of dividends. In 2005, the Company expended $11.5 million in purchase and transaction costs to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in a self tender auction, and repaid approximately $2.0 million of amounts previously borrowed under its secured revolving credit term loans, all funded through the unsecured borrowing described above that, with detachable warrants, provided $15.0 million of financing. In addition, with its earlier refinancing on January 7, 2005 described above, the Company borrowed $18.3 million of revolving debt and $13.0 million of term financing that was used to repay previously outstanding revolving credit. During 2005, $2.4 million of such term debt was repaid as scheduled. The Company paid no dividends in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company suspended its dividend pending the negotiation of its new credit facility, which restricted dividend payments through the first quarter of 2006. The Companys Board of Directors authorized the resumption of dividends in the third quarter of 2006. The Companys ability to continue to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels and demonstrate compliance with its borrowing agreements. The effect of changes in foreign currency rates generated cash of $0.4 million in 2006 compared to a decrease in cash of $0.2 million in 2005 as the dollar weakened compared to the Euro, coupled by a continued weakening against the Canadian dollar and to a lesser extent, a strengthening against the Mexican peso. As a result of all of the above items, the Company experienced a net decrease in cash of $2.5 million in 2006 compared to generating a net increase in cash of $2.9 million in 2005. The Company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the Companys operations for the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, the Companys Off Balance Sheet arrangements, as that term is described by the Securities and Exchange Commission, included $1.8 million and $5.4 million of standby letters or credit to support high loss deductible workers compensation insurance programs and the Companys commitments with respect to industrial revenue bonds, respectively. These letters of credit are provided by the Companys senior secured lender and are renewable on an annual basis. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The use of the last in, first out (LIFO) method of accounting for the majority of inventories results in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets would increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. 20 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a more likely than not threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is required to be adopted by the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements, but is not yet in a position to make this determination. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in the quantification of a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. The Company adopted SAB 108 for its year ending December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its results of operations and financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential change in an assets or financial instruments value caused, for example, by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. The Companys primary market risk exposures are unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, and the interest rate. Monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management. Market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and economic developments, giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings. The Companys financial advisors, both internal and external, provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect managements assessment. Management does not currently hedge its interest or foreign currency exchange risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Sensitivity The Company has operations in several foreign countries, and approximately $31.1 million of the Companys revenue from continuing operations was derived from the Companys operations outside the United States. Accordingly, exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates. No foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates were entered into during 2006 and 2005. The Companys consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and accordingly, changes in the exchange rates between Company subsidiaries local currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results. The Company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally. It is estimated that a 10% change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than $0.2 million. Interest Rate Sensitivity The effective interest rate payable on the Companys borrowings is influenced by the Companys operating performance, degree and composition of leverage, LIBOR, as well as by actions of the Federal Reserve Bank Board in establishing from time to time the Federal Funds Interest Rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the Company. In 2006 as in 2005, in response to improved economic conditions and inflationary tendencies, the Federal Reserve took several actions to increase interest rates. This, along with similar actions of other central 21 Table of Contents banks, led to a rise in LIBOR. This increase was partially offset by the 50 basis point reduction in the interest rates for the Companys senior secured loans in the second quarter of 2006, based on our 2005 operating results. As a result the effective interest rate that the Company paid on its borrowings under its revolving and term secured credit facility increased in 2006. This, coupled with the Companys separate borrowings under the terms of a higher rate subordinated debt in October 2005, contributed to a corresponding increase in the Companys interest expense. To the extent that the Federal Funds Interest Rate and LIBOR continue to rise in the future, the effective interest rate on Companys revolving and term secured facility will increase, and the Companys interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant. Based on the balance outstanding under the Companys secured credit facility at December 31, 2006, a 1% change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by $0.1 million. 22 Table of Contents

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The Company is a worldwide manufacturer of mechanical and electronic products used in the process of power transmission for industrial and other commercial applications. Fiscal year 2006 continued to reflect strong demand in the Companys marketplace, particularly for its Mechanical Division products, experienced by the Company beginning in 2004 following a prolonged slump in the industrial markets that began in the second half of 2000. The favorable economic conditions have permitted the Company to be able to continue a disciplined strategy of price increases. In addition, costs for the Companys primary raw materials, principally the costs of scrap steel and ancillary steel based components used in the manufacture of its mechanical products, remained fairly stable throughout 2006 and 2005 following a period of significant volatility and upward cost pressure that occurred in 2004. The Company continued to address other cost reduction activities through expanded lean manufacturing initiatives. Together, these matters contributed to continued improvement in overall profitability for the Company in 2006. 14 Table of Contents The following tables, derived from the Companys audited consolidated financial statements, present selected elements of the Companys operating results, and the changes thereto, for each of the two most recent years compared to the results for the immediately preceding year. Year ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands) 2006 2005 Dollar Change % Change Sales Mechanical Business $ 79,773 $ 72,361 $ 7,412 10.2 % Electronics Business 39,162 38,536 626 1.6 % Total Sales $ 118,935 $ 110,897 $ 8,038 7.2 % Cost of Sales Mechanical Business $ 55,512 $ 52,213 $ 3,299 6.3 % Electronics Business 25,278 24,979 299 1.2 % Total Cost of Sales $ 80,790 $ 77,192 $ 3,598 4.7 % Gross Profit Mechanical Business $ 24,261 $ 20,148 $ 4,113 20.4 % Electronics Business 13,884 13,557 327 2.4 % Total Gross Profit $ 38,145 $ 33,705 $ 4,440 13.2 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 28,641 $ 27,717 $ 924 3.3 % Sales as a percentage of total sales Mechanical Business 67.1 % 65.3 % Electronics Business 32.9 % 34.7 % Total Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Sales as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 69.6 % 72.2 % Electronics Business 64.5 % 64.8 % Total Cost of Sales 67.9 % 69.6 % Gross Profit as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 30.4 % 27.8 % Electronics Business 35.5 % 35.2 % Total Gross Profit 32.1 % 30.4 % SGA Expense as a percentage of total sales 24.1 % 25.0 % Consolidated revenues increased in 2006 by $8.0 million, or 7.2%, with the Companys largest distributor buying $1.5 million, or 8.0% more than in 2005. Overall sales volume growth provided $4.7 million of the increase; product mix and pricing, net of rebates, accounted for $2.5 million; and currency gain contributed $0.8 million. This revenue gain was largely from the Mechanical Business where sales increased 10.2% or $7.4 million over fiscal 2005. Higher volume contributed $4.3 million of this gain; improved pricing added $2.6 million; and $0.5 million of the increase was caused by the favorable effects of the Canadian currency. Electronic Business revenue increased $0.6 million or 1.6% over fiscal 2005, with $0.4 million of this gain from higher volume and $0.2 million increase as a result of favorable currency, largely due to a stronger Euro. The Companys gross profit increased in 2006 by $4.4 million to $38.1 million. Because gross profit increased at a higher rate than sales, gross margin expressed as a percent of net sales rose from 30.4% to 32.1%. Our Mechanical Business was the main contributor to the gross profit rise with a $4.1 million increase in gross profit. Higher volume contributed $2.1 million while favorable pricing provided $2.5 million. This favorable outcome was partly offset by an increase in energy and other costs of operations. Electronic Business gross margin increased by $0.3 million or 2.4%, principally as a result of $0.2 million of higher volume and $0.1 million favorable Euro currency effect. In 2006, selling, general and administrative costs increased $0.9 million compared to 2005, but declined from 25.0% to 24.1% measured as a percentage of net sales. Higher management incentive accruals of $0.5 million and increased freight costs of $0.3 million associated with higher volumes were principal causes of increased SGA costs in 2006. 15 Table of Contents Interest expense and other finance charges increased $1.3 million to $3.6 million compared to the prior year. This increase was principally caused by higher average debt levels and interest rates attributable to the Companys senior subordinated debt arrangements finalized in October of 2005. The Companys income tax rates are lower than statutory rates primarily due to certain income tax credits. The income tax provision for the full year 2006 was $0.5 million higher than amounts provided in the prior year primarily due to increased pre tax profits. As a result of the above, 2006 net income was $4.1 million, or $1.05 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for fiscal 2005. Diluted net income per share in 2006 increased due to higher income, as well as a lower number of outstanding shares resulting from the Companys buy back of 1.5 million shares in October 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 (in thousands) 2005 2004 Dollar Change % Change Sales Mechanical Business $ 72,361 $ 63,732 $ 8,629 13.5 % Electronics Business 38,536 37,783 753 2.0 % Total Sales $ 110,897 $ 101,515 $ 9,382 9.2 % Cost of Sales Mechanical Business $ 52,213 $ 47,788 $ 4,425 9.3 % Electronics Business 24,979 26,004 (1,025 ) (3.9 %) Total Cost of Sales $ 77,192 $ 73,792 $ 3,400 4.6 % Gross Profit Mechanical Business $ 20,148 $ 15,944 $ 4,204 26.4 % Electronics Business 13,557 11,779 1,778 15.1 % Total Gross Profit $ 33,705 $ 27,723 $ 5,982 21.6 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 27,717 $ 28,371 $ (654 ) (2.3 %) Sales as a percentage of total sales Mechanical Business 65.3 % 62.8 % Electronics Business 34.7 % 37.2 % Total Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of Sales as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 72.2 % 75.0 % Electronics Business 64.8 % 68.8 % Total Cost of Sales 69.6 % 72.7 % Gross Profit as a percentage of sales Mechanical Business 27.8 % 25.0 % Electronics Business 35.2 % 31.2 % Total Gross Profit 30.4 % 27.3 % SGA Expense as a percentage of total sales 25.0 % 27.9 % The continuing strength in general economic conditions during 2005 helped the Company experience a $9.4 million increase in revenues compared to 2004. The revenue growth can be attributed to three major factors: increased demand or volume for the Companys products, increased prices for those products, and foreign currency fluctuations relative to the United States dollar and the local currency utilized by the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The Companys Mechanical Division experienced increased selling volume of $5.8 million, which accounted for nearly two thirds of its total revenue growth. The Company believes that the strong economic recovery, buoyed in part by the market for the Companys products used in oil production, contributed substantially to this increased demand. The Company was also able to increase prices in 2005 for certain of its Mechanical products, contributing approximately $2.1 million to increased revenues for the year. The remainder of the Mechanical Division sales growth related to a stronger Canadian dollar. The Company also experienced a $0.6 million increase in sales of its electronic products 16 Table of Contents attributable to increased sales of products used to produce petroleum and the successful introduction of the Companys new X 4AC drive. The remaining increase in sales revenues related to minor price changes and currency fluctuations. Overall gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 30.4% in 2005 compared to 27.3 % in 2004. This gain can be attributed to $2.0 million of price increases, or 1.9 points, and the absence in 2005 of $1.5 million in non recurring closure costs associated with the closure of the Trenton facility incurred in 2004, or 1.4 points. Gains from currency of approximately $0.3 million and reduced LIFO costs of $0.8 million were largely offset by the higher cost of goods sold for products produced in previous years being recognized in 2005, as the Company made substantial reductions in its inventories from prior year levels. Gross profits of the Companys Mechanical Division increased approximately $4.2 million, to 27.8% of sales in 2005 compared to 25.0% of sales in 2004, principally due to selling price increases, higher sales volume levels and the elimination of the non recurring costs described above, offset by the effects of increased sales of lower margin products, and higher unit costs of goods sold in the current period attributable to goods made in previous years. 2005 production levels were kept lower than sales volume in order to reduce investment in inventory, which declined by $3.4 million. The Electronic Business gross profit increased $1.8 million, to 35.2% of sales compared to 31.2% of sales in 2004. The 4.0 points of margin improvement can be attributable primarily to a lower overall production cost structure, as the Company realized a full year of reduced unit costs attributable to cost savings initiatives undertaken in the second half of 2004. In addition, minor sales volume and product mix gains contributed approximately 1.0 point to this margin improvement. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined $0.7 million in 2005 compared to the previous fiscal year. Due to increased revenue levels, the above decline in these costs resulted in selling, general and administrative expenses being 25.0% of sales in 2005 compared to 27.9% of sales in 2004. The primary reason for the lower costs in 2005 was the $1.1 million decrease in salaries and benefit costs in 2005 principally resulting from restructuring of corporate sales and marketing costs in the second half of 2004, and a $0.3 million decrease in insurance costs. The effects of these cost savings initiatives were offset by the elimination of $0.6 million of amortized gains recognized in 2004 prior to the termination of the Companys post employment healthcare insurance program in the fourth quarter of 2004, and to a lesser extent $0.3 million in management incentive expense recognized in 2005 related to overall improved operating performance. In 2004, the Company continued steps to maintain total healthcare spending at affordable levels. In connection with these efforts, when the Company announced the termination of its post employment healthcare benefit plan in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a pre tax gain aggregating $9.3 million. This item is presented as a non recurring gain in the Companys income statement for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company also recorded $3.6 million deferred tax expense arising from the reduction of a previously recognized deferred tax asset associated with these benefits, resulting in a $1.09 increase in earnings per share in 2004 associated with the plan termination gain. Interest expense increased to $2.3 million in 2005 compared to $1.6 million in 2004. In January 2005, the Company refinanced its variable rate secured revolving credit and term loan agreement, and amended the agreement in July 2005, when the Company extended the agreement for an additional two years to April 2009. This new agreement carries higher stated interest rates. In addition, in October 2005, the Company completed a self tender offer to acquire 1.5 million shares of the Companys then outstanding common stock. This transaction was funded under the terms of a securities purchase agreement whereby the Company obtained $15.0 million from the sale of 12% fixed rate unsecured notes and detachable warrants to acquire shares of Companys common stock. Approximately $0.4 million of increased interest costs can be attributable to the higher secured credit agreement stated rates, as well as general market rate interest cost changes. The remaining $0.3 million increase in interest costs can be attributable to the terms of the unsecured credit agreement. The Companys effective tax rate increased to 35% of pre tax income in 2005, compared to a rate of 34% for 2004, each approximating the statutory rates. After taking into consideration all of the above matters, net income for 2005 was $2.4 million, or $0.48 per share on both a basic and diluted basis. This compares to a net income for 2004 of $4.6 million, or $0.89 per share. After taking into account $5.7 million of non recurring gain related to the termination of the Companys post employment healthcare benefit plan, described above, the Company would have had a net loss of $1.1 million in 2004 on a pro forma basis. 17 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies This discussion and analysis is based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included as part of this document. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, post retirement benefits, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see Note 2 to the attached Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, current economic trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies include: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The majority of the Companys accounts receivable are due from selected authorized industrial distributors who resell the Companys products to OEMs and end users for replacement parts. Accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and are stated at amounts due from the customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligations to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowances for doubtful accounts. Product Warranty: In the ordinary course of business, the Company warrants its products against defect in design, materials, and workmanship over various time periods. Warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon managements best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. The warranty reserve and allowance for product returns is not significant to the financial position of the Company for all periods presented. Inventory: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the last in first out basis for a majority of US inventories and the first in first out method for all remaining inventories. The Company has recorded a reserve for obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required. Impairment of Goodwill and Long Lived Assets: The Company periodically evaluates the realizable value of long lived assets including property, plant and equipment, relying on a number of factors including operating results, budgets, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. The Companys past business acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill, which may result in future impairment expenses. The Companys other intangible assets which primarily consist of product application software, affects the amount of future period amortization expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition: The Companys revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer, the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Company establishes allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts, sales discounts, product warranty and returns based upon historical experience. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included as a component of net sales. 18 Table of Contents Income Taxes: Under the requirements of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, which, if actual experience varies, could result in material adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as follows (dollars in thousands): Less More Contractual Obligations in Than 1 1 3 3 5 Than 5 Thousands Total Year Years Years Years Long Term Debt Obligations $ 29,300 $ 4,744 $ 4,036 $ 147 $ 20,373 Operating Lease Obligations 4,720 1,093 1,505 1,072 1,050 Total $ 34,020 $ 5,837 $ 5,541 $ 1,219 $ 21,423 At December 31, 2006, current and long term debt totaled approximately $28.6 million, net of $0.7 million of unamortized discount, compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2005, and was comprised of $1.1 million and $7.3 million in revolving and term debt, respectively, under a senior secured credit facility; $5.3 million in tax exempt revenue bonds; and $0.6 million of principally foreign revolving and term credits, together with $14.3 million of unsecured subordinated term debt. The Companys effective borrowing rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 for its long term obligations were approximately 9.93% and 9.49%, respectively. The Companys senior secured loan and security agreement, as amended (the Loan Agreement) provides for up to an $18.3 million revolving line of credit and a term loan totaling $7.3 million as of December 31, 2006. The line of credit portion of the Loan Agreement includes existing letters of credit that support $5.3 million of industrial revenue bonds and approximately $1.7 million of obligations under various self insured workers compensation insurance policies. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys domestic assets and pledges of 65% of the outstanding stock of the Companys Canadian, German and Mexican subsidiaries. The Loan Agreement expires in April 2009. All borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear variable interest of a margin plus LIBOR or U.S. Prime Rate, and the term loan is repayable in equal monthly principal installments totaling $1.5 million annually. The average borrowing rates for the Companys short term borrowings under the senior secured credit arrangement at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were 7.86% and 7.97% respectively. At December 31, 2006 the Company had remaining borrowing capacity of $8.3 million. The Loan Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that require the Company to comply with certain financial tests including, among other things, maintaining minimum tangible net worth, having a minimum earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and meeting certain specified leverage and operating ratios, all as defined in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also contains other restrictive covenants that restrict outside investments, capital expenditures, and dividends. At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. The Company previously borrowed approximately $3.0 million and $2.3 million by issuing Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the industrial development corporations of the City of San Marcos, Texas and City of Chattanooga, Tennessee, respectively. These bonds bear variable interest rates (3.77% at December 31, 2006) and mature in April 2024 and April 2022. The bonds were issued to finance production facilities for the Companys manufacturing operations located in those cities, and are secured by letters of credit issued under the terms of the Companys Loan Agreement. On October 20, 2005, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for the issuance of $15.0 million of senior subordinated notes valued at $14.24 million and detachable warrants, valued at $0.76 million, to purchase 174,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The senior subordinated notes have a stated rate of 12% (approximate effective rate of 13%), are due on October 12, 2012, and contain customary financial covenants similar to, but less restrictive than, the Companys senior secured bank indebtedness described above. The proceeds from the sale of the notes and detachable warrants were used to acquire 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock at a purchase price of $11.25 million, repay approximately $2.0 million of term debt under the Companys senior secured borrowing agreement, pay $1.0 million of transaction costs related to the stock purchase and related financing transaction, with the balance providing additional working capital. 19 Table of Contents In addition to the above borrowing arrangements, $0.4 million at December 31, 2006 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2005 were outstanding under the terms of an unsecured revolving credit facility and a term loan, each borrowed by the Companys Italian subsidiary. Interest only was payable on the term loan during 2004, and principal repayments commenced beginning in 2005. The rates for these loans ranged from 1.3% to 3.9%. The Company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years. During 2006, the Company generated $4.6 million cash from operating activities, which compares to $12.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The primary reason for this fluctuation was $2.4 million of increased cash flow from operating results, offset by $10.1 million of decreased cash flow from additional investment in working capital and other operating assets in 2006 compared to 2005. The major reason for the 2006 decrease in cash generated from operating results was the Company using $4.1 million of cash to increase inventory in 2006, compared to positive cash flow generated of $4.8 million from reducing inventory in 2005. Management currently expects that inventory will grow moderately in 2007 in line with demand, while at the same time the Company works to further improve inventory turns through better processes and lean manufacturing initiatives. The Company used $5.5 million and $2.5 million for investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This spending was primarily for capital expenditures of $5.4 million in 2006 and $3.1 million in 2005. The Companys capital investments have been maintained to allow for improvements in operating efficiencies and product quality. In 2007, the Company plans to spend $4.1 million on capital improvements for continued improvement in operating efficiencies and normal capital maintenance projects. The amount of commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2006 was not significant. Cash used in financing activities declined to $2.1 million in 2006 compared to $6.7 million in 2005. Principal uses of cash for financing activities in 2006 included $1.5 million of scheduled repayments of senior secured term debt and payment of $0.7 million of dividends. In 2005, the Company expended $11.5 million in purchase and transaction costs to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in a self tender auction, and repaid approximately $2.0 million of amounts previously borrowed under its secured revolving credit term loans, all funded through the unsecured borrowing described above that, with detachable warrants, provided $15.0 million of financing. In addition, with its earlier refinancing on January 7, 2005 described above, the Company borrowed $18.3 million of revolving debt and $13.0 million of term financing that was used to repay previously outstanding revolving credit. During 2005, $2.4 million of such term debt was repaid as scheduled. The Company paid no dividends in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company suspended its dividend pending the negotiation of its new credit facility, which restricted dividend payments through the first quarter of 2006. The Companys Board of Directors authorized the resumption of dividends in the third quarter of 2006. The Companys ability to continue to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels and demonstrate compliance with its borrowing agreements. The effect of changes in foreign currency rates generated cash of $0.4 million in 2006 compared to a decrease in cash of $0.2 million in 2005 as the dollar weakened compared to the Euro, coupled by a continued weakening against the Canadian dollar and to a lesser extent, a strengthening against the Mexican peso. As a result of all of the above items, the Company experienced a net decrease in cash of $2.5 million in 2006 compared to generating a net increase in cash of $2.9 million in 2005. The Company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the Companys operations for the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, the Companys Off Balance Sheet arrangements, as that term is described by the Securities and Exchange Commission, included $1.8 million and $5.4 million of standby letters or credit to support high loss deductible workers compensation insurance programs and the Companys commitments with respect to industrial revenue bonds, respectively. These letters of credit are provided by the Companys senior secured lender and are renewable on an annual basis. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The use of the last in, first out (LIFO) method of accounting for the majority of inventories results in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets would increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. 20 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a more likely than not threshold. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is required to be adopted by the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on its consolidated financial statements, but is not yet in a position to make this determination. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in the quantification of a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. The Company adopted SAB 108 for its year ending December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its results of operations and financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential change in an assets or financial instruments value caused, for example, by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. The Companys primary market risk exposures are unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and each of the Euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, and the interest rate. Monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management. Market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and economic developments, giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings. The Companys financial advisors, both internal and external, provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect managements assessment. Management does not currently hedge its interest or foreign currency exchange risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Sensitivity The Company has operations in several foreign countries, and approximately $31.1 million of the Companys revenue from continuing operations was derived from the Companys operations outside the United States. Accordingly, exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates. No foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates were entered into during 2006 and 2005. The Companys consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and accordingly, changes in the exchange rates between Company subsidiaries local currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results. The Company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally. It is estimated that a 10% change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than $0.2 million. Interest Rate Sensitivity The effective interest rate payable on the Companys borrowings is influenced by the Companys operating performance, degree and composition of leverage, LIBOR, as well as by actions of the Federal Reserve Bank Board in establishing from time to time the Federal Funds Interest Rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the Company. In 2006 as in 2005, in response to improved economic conditions and inflationary tendencies, the Federal Reserve took several actions to increase interest rates. This, along with similar actions of other central 21 Table of Contents banks, led to a rise in LIBOR. This increase was partially offset by the 50 basis point reduction in the interest rates for the Companys senior secured loans in the second quarter of 2006, based on our 2005 operating results. As a result the effective interest rate that the Company paid on its borrowings under its revolving and term secured credit facility increased in 2006. This, coupled with the Companys separate borrowings under the terms of a higher rate subordinated debt in October 2005, contributed to a corresponding increase in the Companys interest expense. To the extent that the Federal Funds Interest Rate and LIBOR continue to rise in the future, the effective interest rate on Companys revolving and term secured facility will increase, and the Companys interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant. Based on the balance outstanding under the Companys secured credit facility at December 31, 2006, a 1% change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by $0.1 million. 22 Table of Contents
