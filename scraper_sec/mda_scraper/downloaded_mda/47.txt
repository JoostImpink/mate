The operations of the Product Sales segment are located in Burlington, North Carolina, where we maintain the offices, research and development laboratories, production operations, and warehouse/distribution facilities. Key Trends Influencing Our Operating Results Our management believes that there are several notable trends that are currently influencing, and are expected in the foreseeable future to continue to influence, our operating results. These include: Economic Uncertainties Causing Variability in Testing Volumes in the Drugs of Abuse Business In 2011, testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients was lower than in the prior year, which we primarily attributed to lower new job creation and reduced employment levels and corresponding drops in hiring caused by economic uncertainties. We feel economic uncertainties may continue to cause variability in our workplace drugs of abuse testing volume in the foreseeable future. Increased POCT Diagnostic Device Test Competition We have experienced increased competition with respect to our POCT diagnostic tests from systems and products developed by others, many of whom compete solely on price. We have continued to experience increased price competition for certain diagnostic testing devices, particularly in the probation, parole and rehabilitation market. 26 Our Strategy Our strategy is to drive profitable growth by building market share, leveraging our existing infrastructure and technical expertise, and driving innovation. We maintain a disciplined culture, focused on the successful execution of our strategy and plans. Building Market Share We have solid niche positions in large markets, relative to our size, that allow us to build market share by offering high quality products and services that are delivered rapidly, priced competitively, and supported by excellent customer service and value added services. Our value added services include data management, collection site management, training, technical support and expertise, as well as review of drug testing policies for clients. Our success in penetrating new accounts has represented a significant component of our growth in market share. Over the past few years, we have expanded our number of sales representatives which has increased our business from new accounts and helps offset risks from uncertain economic conditions that may cause lower activity from existing workplace drugs of abuse clients. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure and Technical Expertise We leverage our existing infrastructure and technical expertise to facilitate top line growth and improve operating margins. We expanded our clinical laboratory capabilities to include clinical and anatomic pathology, microbiology, molecular diagnostics, and other specialized testing capabilities. This expansion leverages existing capabilities and opens up new revenue opportunities by offering full service testing capabilities to the physician office market. Our LEAN and Six Sigma initiatives support our effort to leverage existing infrastructure by improving quality and productivity, cutting costs, and increasing throughput. LEAN is a highly disciplined process that helps us focus on reducing waste and eliminating unnecessary steps in our business processes. Our Six Sigma initiatives address quality and variability within processes. While all key departments in the Laboratory Services and Product Sales segments have now been through initial LEAN processes, as an organization we recognize that LEAN is an ongoing philosophy, not a project to be finished. Driving Innovation We have continuously introduced a number of innovative products and services, including: In 2011, we introduced a new self contained rapid drug testing device, the EZ SCREEN Cup. This cup can be used in both the government and workplace markets. Designed to meet the needs of non laboratory personnel in order to easily run a drug test with minimal urine handling, the new cup also reduces the chance of specimens leaking during transit to the laboratory due to a new lid design. In 2011 and 2010, we continued the expansion of our prescription management business. We offer a comprehensive testing program serving this market under the name ToxAssure. 27 Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding our business and results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, with no need for managements judgment in their application. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Companys business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Note that the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10 K requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue Recognition, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts: Our sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients, patients and third parties, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance companies. We are seeing an increase in the percentage of revenues that are billed to third party payers and patients as a result of growth in our clinical laboratory. Client sales are recorded at our list price, less any negotiated discount. Net receivables due from clients represented approximately 86% of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011. Patients are billed at established patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with healthcare insurers or physicians on behalf of their patients. Patient billing is increasing as a result of the growth in patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. Collection of receivables due from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay. Net receivables due from patients represented approximately 1% of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011. We bill third party payers at our list price and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. These discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule or estimated fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer. Our third party sales are recorded for each payer using a contracted fee schedule or an estimated fee schedule. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to net revenues. These adjustments are not material to our results of operations in any period presented. We periodically adjust these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends. Net receivables due from third parties represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011. We have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of our receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding. Our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment, and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables, specific account reviews, historical collection experience, and other external factors that could affect the collectability of our receivables. Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible. Our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 was $17.0 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.9 million. 28 Goodwill: Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. The entire amount of goodwill is included within the Laboratory Services segment. The impairment test is performed using a two step process. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any that should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Projected discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate. In developing this discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual forecast for the reporting unit, historical experience, and anticipated future economic conditions. Discount rate assumptions for the reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and our weighted average cost of capital. To assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a market approach which consists of comparisons to comparable publicly traded companies in our industry. At December 31, 2011, our goodwill was $16.0 million. If we experience significant negative economic trends or disruptions to our business, we may be subject to future impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our business, an increase in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows, or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators. Any future impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes: As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies, and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period, we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily consist of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In the future, revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets and liabilities could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period, although our cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) is completely utilized or expires unused. At December 31, 2011, we did not have a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 29 We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. At December 31, 2011, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. Results of Operations In evaluating our financial performance, our management has primarily focused on three objectives: maximizing operating income, increasing our cash flows, and strengthening our balance sheet. The first of these objectives is discussed in this section. The other two are addressed under Liquidity and Capital Resources. To maximize our operating income, we have sought revenue growth, improved gross margin, and reduced selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues. As discussed below, during 2011, we made positive strides on all three fronts. Revenues Year Ended December 31 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Revenues: Laboratory Services Drugs of abuse testing services $ 41,343 $ 39,624 $ 36,040 $ 1,719 4% $ 3,584 10% Clinical & other laboratory services 34,852 29,923 22,885 4,929 17% 7,038 31% Clinical trial services 9,667 7,500 6,926 2,167 29% 574 8% Product Sales 22,287 20,054 18,257 2,233 11% 1,797 10% $ 108,149 $ 97,101 $ 84,108 $ 11,048 11% $ 12,993 15% Our Laboratory Services segment includes revenues from drugs of abuse testing services, clinical & other laboratory services and clinical trial services. Our revenues from drugs of abuse testing increased 4% to $41.3 million in 2011 and 10% to $39.6 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 was due to revenue growth of 14% from new clients, partially offset by a 10% decline in revenue from existing clients. Revenues from our existing client base continue to be negatively impacted by economic conditions. While economic conditions may continue to have a negative impact on laboratory drugs of abuse testing volumes from our existing client base, we have demonstrated a consistent ability to add new business year over year. We will be adding sales resources in this area in 2012 in an effort to maintain market share gains. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to revenue growth from new clients, partially offset by a decline in revenue from existing drugs of abuse clients. Pricing for our workplace drugs of abuse testing services tends to be fairly stable overall; however, the average price per testing specimen can vary slightly from quarter to quarter. Test price can vary by client based on the percentage of samples that test positive for drugs of abuse and the average number of samples per shipment. Revenues from our clinical and other laboratory services increased 17% to $34.9 million and 31% to $29.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The improvement in 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to continued strong growth generated by our expanded clinical laboratory capabilities and diversification initiatives, including testing for prescription management. 30 Revenues from clinical trial services increased 29% to $9.7 million and 8% to $7.5 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The significant increase in 2011 reflects the impact of the reversal of the slow down of projects, which we experienced in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in 2010 over 2009 reflects the return to a more normalized level of activity after being negatively impact by our biopharmaceutical clients deferring projects and slowing down in research and development efforts in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010. Revenues from clinical trial services can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the project nature, size, and the actual timing of clinical trials as shown in the table below: Revenues from clinical trial services: First Second Third Fourth (In thousands) Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Revenues: 2011 $ 2,536 $ 2,323 $ 2,375 $ 2,433 2010 $ 833 $ 2,037 $ 2,358 $ 2,272 Our Product Sales segment includes revenues from point of collection on site testing products (POCT), contract manufacturing services and other diagnostic products. Sales of POCT products, which consist of the PROFILE II, PROFILE II A, PROFILE II ER, PROFILE III ER, PROFILE III, PROFILE III A, PROFILE V, VERDICT II and SURE SCREEN, and EZ SCREEN Cup on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances, increased 14% to $20.3 million in 2011 and 8% to $17.8 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to increased sales of Profile V sold into the hospital market with our MEDTOXScan Reader and increased sales into the government market with our SURE SCREEN devices. The increase in 2010 was largely due to strong sales in the workplace drugs of abuse market with our Profile II A and Profile III A products, and increased sales of Profile V sold into the hospital market with our MEDTOXScan Reader. Overall, pricing for our POCT devices in 2011 was fairly stable with the prior year. Sales of contract manufacturing services decreased 23% to $1.2 million in 2011 as we are phasing out of this business and expect negligible revenue in 2012. Sales of contract manufacturing services increased 13% to $1.6 million in 2010 primarily due to additional revenue from one of our clients whose contract expired on June 30, 2010. Sales of other diagnostic products increased 14% to $0.8 million in 2011 and 59% to $0.7 million in 2010 due to sales of the NexScreen 12 panel diagnostic product which we began distributing in 2010. 31 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 (In thousands) 2011 % of Revenues 2010 % of Revenues 2009 % of Revenues $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Cost of Revenues: Cost of Services $ 54,346 63.3%* $ 49,036 63.6%* $ 45,432 69.0%* $ 5,310 11% $ 3,604 8% Cost of Sales 8,968 40.2%** 8,425 42.0%** 7,781 42.6%** 543 6% 644 8% $ 63,314 58.5% $ 57,461 59.2% $ 53,213 63.3% $ 5,853 10% $ 4,248 8% * Cost of services as a percentage of Laboratory Services revenues ** Cost of sales as a percentage of Product Sales revenues Consolidated gross margin was 41.5% of revenues in 2011, compared to 40.8% of revenues in 2010 and 36.7% of revenues in 2009. Laboratory Services gross margin was 36.7% in 2011, compared to 36.4% in 2010 and 31.0% in 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to a change in test mix and an increase in volume, partially offset by increased transportation expenses as a result of higher fuel costs from our service providers. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to a change in test mix and an increase in volume. Gross margin from Product Sales was 59.8% in 2011, compared to 58.0% in 2010 and 57.4% in 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to sales mix of POCT devices, with an increase in our higher margin PROFILE V devices sold into the hospital market, partially offset by an increase in sales of our lower margin SURE SCREEN devices into the government market. The increase in 2010 primarily reflects a shift in sales mix, with an increase in higher margin Profile devices sold into the workplace and hospital markets and a decrease in sales of lower margin SURE SCREEN devices into the government market. Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 (In thousands) 2011 % of Revenues 2010 % of Revenues 2009 % of Revenues $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Operating Expenses: Selling, general and administrative $ 35,144 32.5% $ 32,691 33.7% $ 26,663 31.7% $ 2,453 8% $ 6,028 23% Research and development 2,519 2.3% 2,261 2.3% 2,264 2.7% 258 11% (3) (1)% $ 37,663 34.8% $ 34,952 36.0% $ 28,927 34.4% $ 2,711 8% $ 6,025 21% Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $35.1 million, or 32.5% of revenues in 2011, compared to $32.7 million, or 33.7% of revenues in 2010 and $26.7 million, or 31.7% of revenues in 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to increased costs associated with the growth in our clinical & other laboratory services business, partially offset by decreased incentive based compensation. Increased expenses associated with the growth in our clinical and other laboratory services business include increased bad debt and billing and collection expenses related to increased third party and patient billings. We recognized approximately $1.6 million of bad debt expense in 2011 which related to a change in estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient and third party receivables at December 31, 2010. The revision was based on our increased experience and the increased actual collection data that we obtained in 2011 relating to these receivables. Bad debt expense was $3.9 million, $2.1 million and $0.6 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to increased costs associated with the growth in clinical revenue and increased incentive based compensation. 32 Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $2.5 million, $2.3 million and $2.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to increased spending for on going product development projects in our Product Sales segment. Other Income (Expense) Other income and expense consists primarily our investment gains/losses, the net expenses associated with our building rental activities and interest expense. Other expense was $161,000 in 2011 compared to other income of $157,000 and $79,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The expense in 2011 was primarily due to increased expenses associated with our building rental activities, as well as an investment loss on our marketable equity securities held in trust for our deferred compensation plans compared to an investment gain in 2010. Our investment loss/gain is offset by a corresponding gain/loss being recorded in SG&A expenses to reflect the change in the retirement plan obligation. Income Taxes In 2011, we recorded $2.6 million in income tax expense, or an effective rate of 36.5%, compared to an effective rate of 37.7% in 2010 and 36.5% in 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital requirements have been funded primarily by various combinations of profitable operations and cash received from our revolving line of credit. Cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We are focusing on increasing our cash flow, while continuing to fund our capital investment, sales and marketing, and research and development initiatives. Our intent is to maintain a solid liquidity position. Net cash provided by operating activities was $14.4 million in 2011 compared to $10.1 million and $5.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in 2011 was attributable to an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, deferred compensation, deferred income taxes and provision for losses on accounts receivable. Our increased revenues in 2011 have continued to drive increases in working capital. The increase in 2010 was attributable to an increase in net earnings, excluding non cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, deferred compensation and provision for losses on accounts receivable. We anticipate fully utilizing our NOLs and expect an increase in income tax payments in 2012. Net cash used in investing activities, consisting of capital expenditures, was $5.9 million in 2011 compared to $5.1 million and $4.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. These expenditures included equipment purchased and costs incurred to upgrade equipment, improve efficiencies and increase service levels to our clients. We expect equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between $6.5 million and $7.0 million in 2012, with increased investment in instrumentation and facility improvements. Such expenditures are expected to be funded through cash provided by operating activities. 33 Net cash used in financing activities was $4.4 million in 2011, compared to $7.8 million and $0.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was high in 2010 due to the payment of a special one time cash dividend of $10.6 million (see below). In 2010, we paid a special one time cash dividend of $1.25 per share. Cash for the dividend was funded from cash on hand and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. We declared the dividend based upon our improving performance, cash balance and anticipated ability to generate cash flow from operations, and therefore believed it was appropriate to return some capital to stockholders through a one time cash dividend. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we repurchased 108,963, 63,355 and 60,644 shares, respectively, of our common stock in the open market for a cost of $1.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The shares repurchased were placed in trust to fund our Long Term Incentive Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. We are a party to a credit security agreement (the "Wells Fargo Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Bank) maturing on August 31, 2013. The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, as amended, consists of a revolving line of credit ("Line of Credit") of up to $12.0 million bearing interest at a fluctuating rate of 1.95% above the daily three month LIBOR, as defined and calculated by the Bank, which was 2.45% at December 31, 2011. Subject to certain conditions, the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit which, if drawn upon, would be deemed advances under the Line of Credit. We are required to pay a fee equal to 0.25% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Line of Credit. We have granted the Bank a first priority security interest in all of the Companys accounts receivable, other rights to payment, general intangibles, inventory, and equipment to secure all indebtedness of the Company to the Bank. Extensions of credit under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement are subject to certain conditions. The Wells Fargo Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining, on a consolidated basis: Tangible Net Worth of not less than $35,000,000 at each month end, with Tangible Net Worth defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets. Current Ratio of not less than 1.45 to 1.0 at each month end, with Current Ratio defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities. Pre tax profit of not less than $1,500,000 on a rolling four quarter basis, determined as of each fiscal quarter end. We were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement at December 31, 2011. We are relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and our Line of Credit to fund our future working capital and asset purchases. At December 31, 2011, we had total borrowing capacity of $12.0 million on our Line of Credit. We did not have an outstanding balance on our Line of Credit at December 31, 2011. 34 In the short term, we believe that the aforementioned resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through 2012. While there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund our future operations beyond 2012, we believe that future profitable operations, as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings, will be the primary means for funding our operations for the long term. We continue to follow a plan which includes (i) aggressively monitoring and controlling costs, (ii) increasing revenues from sales of our existing products and services, (iii) developing new products and services, as well as (iv) selectively pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase our critical mass. However, there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled, revenues can be increased, financing may be obtained, acquisitions successfully consummated, or that we will be profitable. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the Companys financial condition and liquidity position at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period (In thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 2,532 $ 725 $ 1,202 $ 605 $ Total contractual obligations $ 2,532 $ 725 $ 1,202 $ 605 $ The table above excludes our obligation for future payments to participants under our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan of approximately $0.9 million at December 31, 2011 as the specific payment dates and amounts are unknown. Off Balance Sheet Transactions We do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The impact of inflation and changing prices in our last three fiscal years has been primarily limited to salary, laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has historically not been material to our operations. In the future, we may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation, although we are responding to these concerns by offering the highest quality products and services, delivered rapidly, priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers. Seasonality We believe that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening. These seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the year end holiday periods, and other major holidays. In addition, inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow. 35 Impact of New Accounting Standards In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. This new guidance was effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2011, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue, provision for bad debts, and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities. This guidance requires certain health care entities to change the presentation of their statement of income by reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts). Additionally, those health care entities are required to provide enhanced disclosure about their policies for recognizing revenue and assessing bad debts. The guidance also requires disclosures of patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts by major payor source) as well as qualitative and quantitative information about changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. This new guidance was effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will decrease both our gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses. The table below shows the estimated impact on revenues, gross margin, and selling, general and administrative expenses, by quarter in 2011 and 2010, of adopting this guidance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we did not have sales denominated in foreign currencies nor did we have any subsidiaries located in foreign countries. As such, we are not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices. At December 31, 2011, we did not have an outstanding balance on our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding on our line of credit. The line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank bears interest at a variable rate of 1.95% above the daily three month LIBOR, which was 2.45% at December 31, 2011. We have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank due to its variable LIBOR rate pricing. At December 31, 2011, a 1 percentage point change in the prime rate would increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows by less than $0.1 million. 36 We do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
