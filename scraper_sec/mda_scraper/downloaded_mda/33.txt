Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. (Risk Factors) in this annual report on form 10 K. Overview We are engaged in the design, manufacture, and supply of communications equipment, services, and systems for global communications infrastructure markets. Our products are used in the infrastructure for traditional wireless networks, third generation (3G) technologies, voice, data, video and internet services, as well as applications for microwave and satellite communications, and other specialized applications. We operate in two groups comprised of five reportable segments: our Antenna and Cable and Satellite Communications segments comprise our Antenna and Cable Products Group and our Base Station Subsystems, Network Solutions, and Wireless Innovations segments comprise our Wireless Network Solutions Group. With the exception of Satellite Communications, all of our operating segments sell products and services to the wireless infrastructure market. Our financial results are influenced by factors in the markets in which we operate and by our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Marketplace factors include competition for customers, raw material prices, product and price competition, economic conditions in various geographic regions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, fluctuations in customer demand, patent and intellectual property issues, litigation results and legal and regulatory developments. We expect that the marketplace environment will remain highly competitive. Our ability to execute our business strategy successfully will require that we meet a number of challenges, including our ability to accurately forecast sales demand and calibrate our manufacturing to such demand, develop, manufacture and successfully market new and enhanced products and product lines, control overhead spending, successfully integrate acquired businesses, and attract, motivate and retain key personnel to manage our operational, financial and management information systems. On November 6, 2007, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our Satellite Communications business to Resilience Capital Partners (Resilience). We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar year 2007. In fiscal 2007, we acquired EMS Wireless (EMS), a division of EMS Technologies, Inc., a major designer and manufacturer of base station antennas based in Norcross, Georgia. In fiscal 2006, we completed a number of acquisitions. We acquired Skyware Radio Systems GmbH (Skyware), a German manufacturer of electronic products for broadband satellite communications networks and Precision Antennas Ltd. (Precision), a Stratford, England based designer and manufacturer of microwave antennas for use in carrying point to point radio signals, primarily for cellular network backhaul. We also acquired CellSite Industries (CSI), a provider of wireless equipment repair services. We believe the acquisition of CSI provides us with a lower cost platform for warranty and repair services. On June 26, 2007, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with CommScope, Inc. (CommScope). Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Andrew common stock will be converted into the right to receive $15.00, comprised of $13.50 per share in cash and an additional $1.50 per share in either cash, CommScope common stock, or a combination of cash and CommScope common stock totaling $1.50 per share, at CommScopes election. The merger agreement contains termination rights for both CommScope and Andrew. Under certain circumstances, including if our board of directors recommends a superior proposal to our stockholders and the merger agreement is terminated as a result thereof, we would be required to pay CommScope a termination fee of $75 million. Following the close of the transaction, Andrew will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CommScope. The merger is subject to regulatory and governmental reviews in the United States and elsewhere, as well as approval by Andrews shareholders. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our sales for fiscal 2007 were $2,195 million, an increase of 2% from fiscal 2006. The sales increase resulted from incremental year over year sales from recent acquisitions of approximately $49 million, a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $57 million, and increased organic sales growth of microwave and base station antennas. These sales increases were offset by sales declines in Base Station Subsystems and Satellite Communications products. Wireless infrastructure capital investment continued to grow in fiscal 2007 across all major geographic regions except for North America, which was impacted by a reduction in spending by two key customers of over $200 million compared to fiscal 2006. The fundamental sources of wireless infrastructure and network growth include increased minutes of usage, increased use of data applications, and the global growth of wireless subscribers. Sales for fiscal 2006 were $2,146 million, an increase of 9% from fiscal 2005. The sales increase resulted from higher sales in Antenna and Cable Products and Base Station Subsystems offset by an expected sales decline in Network Solutions. Our top 25 customers accounted for 71% of our sales in fiscal 2007 compared to 69% of sales in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. Major OEMs accounted for 44% of our sales in fiscal 2007 compared to 39% in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks accounted for 12% and 11% of our sales, respectively, in fiscal 2007. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, Cingular Wireless accounted for 11% of total sales. Gross profit margin was 21.4% in fiscal 2007, a decrease of 70 basis points from our fiscal 2006 gross profit margin of 22.1%, due mainly to a geographic mix shift in sales and approximately $16 million of costs associated with our transition to new cable and antenna manufacturing facilities in Joliet, Illinois and Goa, India. Gross profit margins decreased slightly from 22.3% in fiscal 2005 to 22.1% in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher commodity costs, especially copper, and a decrease in Network Solutions margin contribution resulting from the completion of United States (U.S.) E 911 upgrade installations. Operating expenses were $586 million in fiscal 2007. Included in operating expenses were $151 million of non cash asset impairments to reduce goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair value, including $108 million of goodwill and $7 million of capitalized software for Base Station Subsystems, $32 million for Satellite Communications goodwill, intangibles and long lived assets, and $4 million of intangible assets and a product license for Network Solutions. Also included in fiscal 2007 operating expenses were $51 million of litigation expenses related to our intellectual property litigation with TruePosition, including a $45 million jury award and $6 million of external legal costs, and $2 million of expenses related to the merger agreement with CommScope. Sales and administrative expenses were $250 million or 11.4% of sales in fiscal 2007 compared to $255 million or 11.9% of sales in fiscal 2006 primarily due to decreased incentive compensation accruals. Research and development expense was $111 million compared to $113 million in fiscal 2006. Operating expenses were $390 million in fiscal 2006, or 18.2% of sales, compared with $359 million in fiscal 2005, or 18.3% of sales. Operating expenses increased $31 million compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to higher sales and administrative costs, which increased from 11.4% of sales in fiscal 2005 to 11.9% of sales in fiscal 2006. Research and development expenses increased $5 million in fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005, but decreased as a percentage of sales from 5.5% in fiscal 2005 to 5.3% in fiscal 2006. We recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $6 million and $8 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. We recorded a loss on the sale of assets of $1 million in 2005. Income tax expense was $34 million in fiscal 2007, $103 million in fiscal 2006 and $24 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in income tax expense in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. In fiscal 2007, we recorded tax expense in international jurisdictions where we are profitable, while we did not record a tax benefit for losses incurred in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where cumulative losses in recent years have resulted in a determination that it is more likely than not that we will not realize those benefits in future periods. Diluted loss per share was $1.04 in fiscal 2007 and $0.22 in fiscal 2006, compared to earnings per share of $0.24 in fiscal 2005. 25 Table of Contents Sales for our five operating segments for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Dollars in millions 2007 % change 2006 % change 2005 Antenna and Cable Products Antenna and Cable $1,412 13 % $1,248 19 % $1,050 Satellite Communications 104 (15 )% 122 (13 )% 140 Total Antenna and Cable Products 1,516 11 % 1,370 15 % 1,190 Wireless Network Solutions Base Station Subsystems 404 (20 )% 505 13 % 446 Network Solutions 87 (4 )% 91 (42 )% 157 Wireless Innovations 188 4 % 180 7 % 168 Total Wireless Network Solutions 679 (13 )% 776 1 % 771 Total Sales $2,195 2 % $2,146 9 % $1,961 Sales by Segment Antenna and Cable sales were $1,412 million in fiscal 2007, a 13% increase from fiscal 2006. Strong microwave antenna, base station antenna and coaxial cable sales, including incremental year over year sales increases of $15 million from the April 2006 acquisition of Precision and $25 million from the December 2007 EMS acquisition, were partially offset by lower sales of cable assemblies and accessories and a decrease in field services. In fiscal 2007, the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific, and Latin America regions had strong sales growth, compared to fiscal 2006, partially offset by lower sales in North America. Sales were $1,248 million in fiscal 2006, an increase of 19% from fiscal 2005, due to growth in all geographic markets. The largest growth areas, in terms of sales dollars contributed, were the EMEA region followed by Asia Pacific and North American regions. The largest product line sales increases were in the coaxial cable and microwave antenna product lines. The increase in EMEA sales was also the result of our acquisition of Precision Antenna, Ltd. in April 2006, which contributed $39 million of revenues in fiscal 2006. Satellite Communications sales were $104 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of 15% from fiscal 2006. The primary decrease was in direct to home products in the North America region. Sales were $122 million in fiscal 2006, a decrease of 13% compared to fiscal 2005. Sales gains in earth station electronics and very small aperture antennas were offset by sales decreases in consumer broadband, earth station antenna and mobile antenna products. The earth station electronics increase in sales was the result of the February 2006 Skyware acquisition. The decrease in mobile antenna products was the result of Andrew exiting that business in fiscal 2005. Base Station Subsystems sales were $404 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of 20% from fiscal 2006. Decreased sales of filters and power amplifiers, primarily in the U.S. from two key customers, were partially offset by approximately $9 million of incremental year over year sales from the acquisition of CSI in May 2006. Base station sales decreases in the North America and EMEA regions were partially offset by increased sales in the Asia Pacific region. Sales were $505 million in fiscal 2006, an increase of 13% from fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher filter and power amplifier sales in North America, which was offset by decreased sales in EMEA. Network Solutions sales were $87 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of 4% from fiscal 2006. The decline in sales was due to lower geolocation product sales and maintenance contract renewals, primarily in the North America market, partially offset by increased sales of geolocation products in the Middle East and increased service revenue. Sales decreased $67 million in fiscal 2006, or 42%, versus fiscal 2005 due primarily to a decline in North American geolocation installations, as major U.S. service providers completed their E 911 equipment upgrades that were mandated by the U.S. government. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the TruePosition litigation ruling, our sales of geolocation products may be adversely affected. Wireless Innovations sales were $188 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 4% from fiscal 2006. Increased repeater product sales were partially offset by decreased project revenue. In fiscal 2007, higher Asia Pacific and North America sales were partially offset by sales decreases in the EMEA region, as compared to fiscal 2006. Sales were $180 million in fiscal 2006, up 7% from fiscal 2005, due to increased RADIAX&reg; sales and repeater product sales primarily in North America and EMEA, both of which have experienced increased demand for greater wireless communication coverage in densely populated urban areas. 26 Table of Contents Sales by Major Geographic Region Dollars in millions 2007 % change 2006 % change 2005 Americas $ 954 (16 )% $ 1,140 6 % $ 1,077 Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) 814 20 % 681 8 % 631 Asia Pacific 427 31 % 325 28 % 253 Total sales $ 2,195 2 % $ 2,146 9 % $ 1,961 Sales in the Americas decreased 16% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to decreases across all segments except Wireless Innovations. Sales to two key customers in North America decreased over $200 million year over year; this was partially offset by increases in sales in Latin America, increased repeater sales, and sales from the acquisition of EMS in December 2006. Sales in the Americas increased 6% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to strong growth in antenna and cable products, power amplifiers and filter sales which were offset by sales decreases in geolocation equipment and satellite products. EMEA sales were $814 million in fiscal 2007, an increase of 20% from fiscal 2006, due to increased Antenna and Cable sales as well as the completion of the initial phase of a significant Middle East geolocation project, partially offset by decreased Base Station Subsystems and Wireless Innovation sales. EMEA sales increased 8% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to strong Antenna and Cable sales, primarily resulting from the acquisition of Precision, offset by lower sales of Base Station Subsystems sales. Asia Pacific sales increased 31% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increased sales of Antenna and Cable and Base Station Subsystems products. Sales increased 28% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to increased Antenna and Cable sales, primarily in India, Indonesia and China. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.4% in fiscal 2007, 22.1% in fiscal 2006, and 22.3% in fiscal 2005. Over the past three years, rising commodity costs, specifically copper, changing product mix and geographic sales mix were significant factors that have adversely impacted our gross profit. The price of copper has increased over 100% over the past two years. We have seen a decrease in higher margin geolocation sales as U.S. service providers have implemented and completed E 911 upgrade installations, partially offset by lower margin international geolocation sales. In addition, gross profit margin decreased in fiscal 2007, due to approximately $16 million of costs incurred to relocate to two new facilities in Joliet, Illinois and Goa, India. Other major factors that have contributed to the decline in gross margin over the past three years are continued price pressure, and higher prices of aluminum, petro chemicals and other commodities. In the last three years, we have experienced significant variability in new lower margin products and services which have put downward pressure on our gross profit margin percentages. Gross Profit By Segment Gross profit margins vary across our operating segments. Generally, Network Solutions and Wireless Innovations gross profit margin percentages are above the corporate average. Network Solutions fiscal 2007 gross margin decreased 1080 basis points from fiscal 2006. The lower margin was due to decreased volume and a change in the geographic mix of sales, as higher margin U.S. geolocation sales were partially replaced with less profitable international geolocation sales in fiscal 2007. Gross margin decreased by 680 basis points in fiscal 2006 versus 2005. Combined with lower fiscal 2006 revenues, Network Solutions fiscal 2006 gross profit dollar contribution decreased 51% or $45 million versus fiscal 2005. Wireless Innovations gross margin increased 330 basis points in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, due to strong repeater product sales. Gross margin increased in fiscal 2006 by 160 basis points versus fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher sales of higher margin RADIAX&reg; cable and repeater products. 27 Table of Contents Antenna and Cables gross margin was slightly below the corporate average at 20.9% for fiscal 2007, primarily due to increased commodity costs and approximately $16 million of costs to relocate to new manufacturing facilities in Joliet, Illinois and Goa, India. These increased costs were partially offset by increased production efficiencies in the new facilities. In fiscal 2006, gross margin was consistent with the corporate average rate of 22.0%, but declined slightly by 10 basis points versus fiscal 2005, due to higher raw material costs. We use commodities such as copper and petrochemicals in the manufacture of our cable products. The most significant of these commodities is copper. The market price of copper has increased from $1.79 per pound as of September 30, 2005 to $3.70 per pound as of September 30, 2007, an increase of 107% over the two year period. We took steps to mitigate the impact of rising copper prices by implementing a copper surcharge and price increase program in fiscal 2006 with all customers in all markets. Implementation of this copper surcharge and price increase program enabled us to partially offset the large increase in the cost of copper. To mitigate some of the fluctuation in copper prices, we buy copper on a forward purchase contract basis for a portion of our projected needs. Additionally, our cable sales in international markets, as a percentage of total sales, have increased in each of the last three years. This has negatively impacted our overall gross margins as certain international service providers generally use smaller diameter, lower margin cable in their networks. Base Station Subsystems is comprised of active components such as filters and power amplifiers that carry a lower gross margin than the overall corporate average. Base Station Subsystems gross margins decreased 340 basis points in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, due to decreased overall sales volumes, higher inventory reserves for slow moving products and a less favorable product mix. Margins increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to decreased warranty and product recall costs. Additionally, we transitioned considerable filter production to our China facility and, in fiscal 2006, we experienced positive results from this transition. Satellite Communications is our lowest gross profit margin segment. In fiscal 2007, gross margin increased 260 basis points from fiscal 2006 due to a sales reduction in lower margin DTH products. In fiscal 2006, margins in this segment decreased 560 basis points versus fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher per unit manufacturing costs of our DTH satellite products, additional costs related to a long term customer contract and transition costs related to our acquisition of Skyware. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $111 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of approximately $2 million from fiscal 2006. Lower R&D spending for Base Station Subsystems and Network Solutions was partially offset by increased R&D costs in the other segments. R&D expenses were 5.1% of sales in fiscal 2007, 5.3% of sales in fiscal 2006, and 5.5% of sales in fiscal 2005. While research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales, they increased $5.1 million in fiscal 2006, or 4.8% from fiscal 2005. The majority of our research and development spending over the last three years has been focused on our active electronic components, especially amplifiers, filters and repeaters and related products. We have continued to invest heavily in the development of new products, specifically our base station antenna and repeater products. Sales and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 11.4% in fiscal 2007, 11.9% in fiscal 2006, and 11.4% in fiscal 2005. Sales and administrative expense decreased $5 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expense. In fiscal 2006, sales and administrative costs increased $32 million, or 14.5%, from fiscal 2005. Factors causing this increase were higher sales expenses to support sales growth in emerging markets and the growing direct to carrier sales channels, higher administrative costs of recent acquisitions that had not been fully integrated, and $4 million of incremental stock option expense. Intangible amortization was $17 million in fiscal 2007, $19 million in fiscal 2006 and $22 million in fiscal 2005. Intangible amortization is primarily related to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the Allen Telecom and Celiant acquisitions. The decrease in intangible amortization in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions. Excluding any new acquisitions, we expect that intangible amortization will decrease to approximately $7 million in fiscal 2008 as more intangible assets become fully amortized. Restructuring expenses were $10 million in fiscal 2007, $8 million in fiscal 2006, and $5 million in fiscal 2005. These costs are primarily severance and other costs associated with integrating our acquisitions, streamlining operations, and other cost cutting initiatives. The expense during fiscal 2007 related to the following segments: Base Station Subsystems, $7 million; Antenna and Cable, $2 million; and unallocated sales and administrative and other segments, $1 million. The majority of the Base Station Subsystems expense resulted from the downsizing of our filter operations in Italy and Mexico. The other expenses were primarily due to cost cutting initiatives to reduce headcount in specific departments. We believe that the outsourcing of filter production and the shifting of production to our low cost China facility, as well as reduced overhead costs associated with these headcount reductions, will increase the future profitability of Base Station Subsystems. We currently estimate the annual benefit from these cost savings to be approximately $2 million, which we began to realize in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we incurred $2 million of severance costs as part of a plan to reorganize our management and operating groups, in addition to other cost cutting initiatives during the year. 28 Table of Contents Merger costs were $2 million in fiscal 2007, consisting of legal and other external costs associated with our pending merger with CommScope. Merger costs were $13 million in fiscal 2006 due to a $10 million fee to terminate our proposed merger with ADC Telecommunications, Inc. and other legal and professional costs related to the merger agreement. . Litigation expenses were $51 million in fiscal 2007. These costs relate to external legal expenses and a $45 million accrual of the unfavorable judgment in the intellectual property litigation with TruePosition. Asset impairment charges were $151 million in fiscal 2007, consisting of non cash asset impairments recorded to reduce goodwill and other long lived assets to fair value, including $108 million of goodwill and $7 million of capitalized software costs for Base Station Subsystems, $32 million for Satellite Communications goodwill, intangible and long lived assets, and $4 million of intangible assets and a product license for Network Solutions. In fiscal 2006, asset impairment charges were $4 million for impaired software costs that were capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The capitalized software impairment charges are for products that we no longer emphasize and for which the future undiscounted cash flows no longer support the assets carrying value. Pension termination gain was $14 million in fiscal 2006 as a result of eliminating pension obligations due to the termination of the frozen Allen Telecom defined benefit plan. In fiscal 2005, we initiated the process of terminating the frozen defined benefit plan assumed as part of the Allen Telecom acquisition. We fully funded and terminated the plan during fiscal 2006 when we purchased a non participating group annuity contract from John Hancock Life Insurance Company for all participants of the Allen Telecom plan. In fiscal 2006, we made additional contributions of $9 million to fully fund the plan. Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a gain of $6 million in fiscal 2007, a gain of $8 million in fiscal 2006, and a loss of $1 million in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2007 gain was primarily the result of the fee we received from the cancellation of the sale of land in Orland Park, Illinois, and the sale of our broadband cable product line. The gain in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of the $9 million gain on the sale of a portion of land at our Orland Park, Illinois facility. In fiscal 2005, we recorded a loss of $1 million from the sale and disposition of certain manufacturing assets. See Note 4, Sale of Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating income (loss) was a loss of $115 million in fiscal 2007, and income of $83 million and $78 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. We use operating income as our internal measurement of segment profit and loss. Operating income (loss) by operating segment for the last three years is as follows: Dollars in millions 2007 2006 2005 Antenna and Cable Products Antenna and Cable $ 216 $ 194 $ 162 Satellite Communications (50 ) (18 ) (6 ) Total Antenna and Cable Products 166 176 156 Wireless Network Solutions Base Station Subsystems (147 ) (7 ) (33 ) Network Solutions (46 ) 10 61 Wireless Innovations 42 35 31 Total Wireless Network Solutions (151 ) 38 59 Items not included in segments Unallocated sales and administrative costs (113 ) (121 ) (114 ) Intangible amortization (17 ) (19 ) (22 ) Merger costs (2 ) (13 ) Pension termination 14 Gain (loss) on sale of assets 2 8 (1 ) Total operating income (loss) $ (115 ) $ 83 $ 78 For purposes of internal management reporting, we do not allocate costs that benefit more than one operating segment. Costs such as finance, accounting, human resources, information systems, legal and executive management are not allocated to operating segments. The only sales and administrative expense that is allocated to operating segments is the cost of our global sales force, which sells all of our products. Antenna and Cables operating income has increased over the last three years due to sales growth partially offset by declining gross profit margins. 29 Table of Contents Base Station Subsystems operating loss in fiscal 2007 was due to lower sales and gross profit margins, and the asset impairment charges of $108 million for goodwill and $7 million for capitalized software costs. Operating loss decreased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to increased direct to carrier revenues, lower warranty costs and higher margins resulting from the transition of substantial filter manufacturing operations to China. In fiscal 2005, Base Station Subsystems operating loss was a result of higher warranty costs, a decrease in filter margins and costs associated with moving filter production to China. Network Solutions operating loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of a $45 million accrual for the TruePosition intellectual property litigation, $3 million of asset impairments and continued decreases in North American geolocation sales. Operating income decreased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, as geolocation sales decreased as a result of the anticipated decline in North American geolocation installations. Continuing a trend from fiscal 2005, most U.S. service providers have substantially completed their E 911 equipment upgrades in fiscal 2006 that were mandated by the U.S. government. Wireless Innovations operating income has continued to grow as this segments sales have increased over the last three years. Profit resulting from higher sales volume was partially offset by increased R&D expenses. Satellite Communications operating loss in fiscal 2007 included $32 million of asset impairment charges and an $18 million loss from operations. The fiscal 2007 $18 million loss from operations was consistent with fiscal 2006. Operating loss increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, due to decreased sales and higher cost of sales due to higher per unit manufacturing costs of DTH satellite products, additional costs related to a long term customer contract and transition costs related to our acquisition of Skyware. Unallocated sales and administrative costs were $113 million in fiscal 2007, a decrease of $8 million from fiscal 2006, primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense. Unallocated sales and administrative costs increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, due to higher administrative costs of recent acquisitions that had not been fully integrated and $4 million of incremental stock option expense. Unallocated sales and administrative costs have decreased as a percentage of sales from 5.7% in fiscal 2005 to 5.6% of sales in fiscal 2006, and 5.1% in fiscal 2007. Other expenses primarily consist of interest expense, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses. Other expenses were $14 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005. Interest expense was $18 million in fiscal 2007, $15 million in fiscal 2006 and $15 million in fiscal 2005. The largest portion of our interest expense was related to the $240 million of convertible notes issued in August 2003 and the long term debt assumed from Allen Telecom. Interest income was $6 million in fiscal 2007, $6 million in fiscal 2006, and $5 million in fiscal 2005. Interest income in fiscal 2005 included $2 million of interest received from a favorable resolution of certain tax related matters. Other expenses were $2 million in fiscal 2007, $5 million in fiscal 2006, and $4 million in fiscal 2005. The majority of other expenses were foreign exchange gains and losses. The foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were primarily due to movements in the British pound, Euro, and Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. Income tax expense was $34 million, $103 million and $24 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and as a percentage of pre tax income (loss) from continuing operations was (26.1)% in fiscal 2007, 149.6% in fiscal 2006, and 38.5% in fiscal 2005. The negative income tax rate for fiscal 2007 results from the inability to book net tax benefits for losses in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to offset the tax expense recorded on income in jurisdictions where we have been historically profitable. Income tax expense for fiscal 2006 was higher than the statutory rate due to an $83.4 million charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets and the establishment of valuation allowances for the tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions which offset the favorable impact of foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates and a $5 million tax benefit from repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was higher than the statutory rate due to an unfavorable geographic mix shift of earnings and the establishment of valuation allowances for tax benefits associated with state and foreign losses. Our effective tax rate is materially affected by the level of pre tax income or loss generated in the U.S., the earnings mix in foreign countries where the statutory rates are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate, and by changes in tax laws. To the extent we are able to generate taxable income in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred taxes, our tax provision will be reduced due to reductions of the valuation allowance as our deferred tax assets are utilized. We are subject to examination of our tax filings by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. We regularly review and assess the potential outcome of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. 30 Table of Contents Net income (loss) available to common shareholders was a loss of $163 million and $34 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders was $39 million in fiscal 2005 and includes preferred stock dividends of $0.2 million. As part of the Allen Telecom acquisition, we issued shares of convertible preferred stock, issuing one share for each share of Allen Telecom convertible preferred stock. In fiscal 2005, we converted all remaining convertible preferred shares into Andrew common shares. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated $57 million of cash from operations in fiscal 2007, despite the significant loss from operations. Cash and cash equivalents were $155 million at September 30, 2007, a decrease of $15 million from September 30, 2006. Working capital was $351 million at September 30, 2007, compared to $585 million at September 30, 2006. The significant decrease in working capital is due to the classification of our $240 million convertible subordinated notes as current liabilities on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2007, as the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes in August 2008. However, we anticipate that these notes will be converted to equity or repurchased in connection with the CommScope acquisition. We believe that our working capital position, ability to generate cash flow from operations, and ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement will allow us to meet our normal operating cash flow needs for the foreseeable future. In fiscal 2005, we entered into a new $250 million revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders that expires in September 2010 (discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under the terms of this facility, we are subject to various quarterly covenant requirements, including maintaining a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to total debt, including letters of credit, maintaining a ratio of EBITDA to senior debt, maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio and limiting the amount of assets that we can dispose of in a fiscal year. These requirements may limit the amount of borrowing under this credit agreement. As of September 30, 2007, we were in violation of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, principally due to the $45 million liability recorded for the TruePosition intellectual property litigation, and the classification of convertible notes as current liabilities, as the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes in August 2008. We obtained a waiver from the lenders that allows us to utilize the entire $250 million until the earlier of December 31, 2007 or the closing of the proposed CommScope transaction. In fiscal 2004, we filed a universal shelf registration statement that allows us to publicly issue up to $750 million of debt or equity through December 2008. This shelf registration statement gives us the flexibility to take advantage of strategic initiatives and other favorable long term opportunities to enhance liquidity. Cash flows. The following table sets forth certain information from our consolidated statements of cash flows: Dollars in millions 2007 2006 2005 Net income (loss) $ (163 ) $ (34 ) $ 39 Non cash charges for depreciation, amortization, asset sales (gains) losses, pension termination gain, stock based compensation, asset impairments and deferred income taxes 228 139 93 Restructuring costs (3 ) (2 ) (7 ) Change in operating assets and liabilities (5 ) (11 ) (36 ) Net cash from operations 57 92 89 Net cash used for investing activities (88 ) (94 ) (76 ) Net cash from (used for) financing activities 2 (19 ) (15 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash 14 2 2 Decrease in cash for the period $ (15 ) $ (19 ) $ Net cash from operations was $57 million, $92 million, and $89 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2007, cash from operations decreased compared to the prior year due to a larger net loss for the year. In fiscal 2006, our net cash from operations was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2005 as increased sales and operating income was offset by higher inventory and accounts receivable amounts in EMEA and Asia Pacific to support our growing business in those geographic markets. 31 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, cash flow from operations was due to a net loss of $163 million, which included non cash charges of $151 million for asset impairments and $79 million for depreciation and amortization and $11 million for stock based compensation. Operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flow from operations by $5 million. During fiscal 2007, operating asset and liability cash inflows were $59 million due to a decrease in inventory caused by higher sales and $18 million due to higher accrued liabilities, which primarily resulted from the TruePosition litigation expense. These cash inflow amounts were offset by cash outflows of $47 million due to an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher sales and $35 million due to an increase in other assets caused by the timing of tax payments and receipts. Accounts receivable was $646 million as of September 30, 2007 compared to $558 million as of September 30, 2006. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 had record sales of $624 million. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 91 days as of September 30, 2007 compared to 80 days and 76 days as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in DSO is primarily due to a higher percentage of fiscal 2007 sales from the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions where collection terms are longer than in the U.S. and consolidation of OEMs in the industry leading to longer payment cycles. Inventory decreased from $388 million as of September 30, 2006 to $364 million as of September 30, 2007. Inventory turns were 5.4x at September 30, 2007 compared to 4.6x and 4.8x at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2006, cash flow from operations was the result of a net loss of $34 million, $79 million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization, a gain on the sale of assets of $9 million, a $14 million non cash gain on the termination of the Allen Telecom pension plan, a net $74 million non cash charge for deferred income taxes, $9 million stock based compensation, cash restructuring costs of $2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a $11 million decrease in cash flow. In fiscal 2005, cash flow from operations was the result of net income of $39 million, $84 million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization, a $6 million non cash charge for deferred income taxes, cash restructuring costs of $7 million, $2 million of stock based compensation, a loss on the sale of assets of $1 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a $36 million decrease in cash flow. To meet increased sales levels, we increased inventory resulting in a $6 million decrease in cash flow. Higher accounts payable and other liabilities increased cash flow by $46 million. Recent legislation enacted in the United Kingdom (U.K.) has accelerated the rate of funding required for the U.K. Pension Plan. In March 2007, we proposed to the U.K. Pensions Regulator a plan to fund a pension deficit as of September 30, 2006, by March 31, 2010. In fiscal 2007, we made cash contributions of $9 million. The following schedule below shows the timing of the additional cash payments we currently intend to make. The schedule is subject to change based on future valuations of the pension plan. Dollars in millions March 2008 March 2009 March 2010 Contribution amount $ 10.1 $ 10.1 $ 2.1 Net cash used for investing activities was $88 million, $94 million and $76 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We spent $58 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 compared to $71 million in fiscal 2006 and $66 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007, we acquired EMS for $49 million and paid additional consideration of $5 million for CSI, which was originally acquired in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, we spent $45 million on the acquisition of businesses. In February 2006, we acquired Skyware for $10 million. In April 2006, Precision was acquired for $28 million and CSI for $6 million. In fiscal 2005, we spent $23 million on acquisitions. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we acquired certain assets of ATC Tower Services, Inc., a provider of site installation services in North America, for $6 million in cash and the assumption of $2 million in capital leases. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we acquired Xenicom Ltd., a United Kingdom based provider of software solutions that help wireless operators plan, launch and manage wireless networks for $11 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we expanded our market leading Geometrix mobile location system product line with the acquisition of certain assets of Nortels mobile location business for $4 million. Also in fiscal 2005, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in a Czech Republic subsidiary that was acquired in the Allen Telecom acquisition for $1 million. Finally, we paid $1 million for a Yantai Fine Cable earn out payment. In fiscal 2007, we received $5 million from the maturity of our note receivable with Cambridge Positioning Systems Ltd. 32 Table of Contents Proceeds from the sale of product lines were $2 million in fiscal 2007 and $9 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007, we sold our Yantai, China facility and inventory and equipment related to our broadband cable product line (the Yantai sale) to Andes Industries, Inc. (Andes) for $2 million in cash and $14 million of notes receivable, payable over a two year period. Concurrent with the sale, we exercised the conversion feature of a note receivable from Andes, obtained in a previous transaction, for a 30% equity ownership interest in Andes. The Yantai sale resulted in a gain of $3 million, of which $2 million was recorded in the statement of operations and the remaining $1 million (30% of the gain) was recorded as a reduction of our investment in Andes. In fiscal 2005, we received net cash proceeds of $9 million from the sale of selected assets of our mobile antenna product line to PCTEL Inc. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment were $16 million in fiscal 2007, $25 million in fiscal 2006, and $6 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2007 we received $9 million in a sale lease back transaction of our Joliet, Illinois facility and $3 million for the sale cancellation and return of escrow funds for the second parcel of land in Orland Park, Illinois, and $4 million from the sale of other fixed assets. In fiscal 2006, we sold a portion of land at our Orland Park, Illinois facility for $9 million, net of transaction costs, and sold certain filter manufacturing assets and inventory to a contract manufacturer for $11 million. The most significant transactions in fiscal 2005 were the sale of a facility in Reynosa, Mexico acquired from Allen Telecom, the sale of unimproved land in Suzhou, China and the sale of a facility in Livonia, Michigan that was acquired from Allen Telecom. We paid $1 million in fiscal 2006 and $2 million in fiscal 2005 to settle patent infringement litigation with TruePosition Inc. as part of litigation brought against Allen Telecom prior to the acquisition by us. This settlement was accounted for as an increase in liabilities assumed from Allen Telecom. Net cash from financing activities was $2 million in fiscal 2007 compared to a use of cash of $19 million and $15 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively. We made payments on our long term debt of $27 million, $9 million, and $15 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We periodically borrow under our various credit agreements to meet our short term cash needs. Net borrowings under these credit agreements were $47 million, $26 million and $16 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Payments to acquire treasury shares were $20 million for 2 million shares in fiscal 2007, $39 million for 4 million shares in fiscal 2006, and $18 million for 1.6 million shares in fiscal 2005. We received cash from the sale of stock under employee and director option plans. Under these plans, we received $4 million, $3 million, and $2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Payments for preferred stock dividends and conversion premium payments were $0.2 million in fiscal 2005. Dividend policy. Although we have never paid dividends to common shareholders, the Board of Directors periodically reviews this practice and, to date, has elected to retain earnings in the business to finance future investments and operations. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The first footnote to our consolidated financial statements (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory reserves, revenue recognition, warranty costs, depreciation and amortization, goodwill and intangible impairments, contingencies, taxes, pension liabilities, and restructuring and merger integration costs. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. A material change in these or other estimates could potentially have a material impact on results of operations. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates: Revenue recognition During fiscal 2007, approximately 91% of our total revenue was recognized when products were shipped and title passed, 3% based on Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, 2% based on EITF No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, 2% based on SOP No. 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, and 2% based on when services were performed. 33 Table of Contents Revenue for software products is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and related interpretations. The fair value of each revenue element is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value determined by stand alone pricing of each element. These contracts typically contain post contract support (PCS) services which are sold both as part of a bundled product offering and as a separate contract. Revenue for PCS services is recognized ratably over the term of the PCS contract. Revenue for certain of our products relates to multiple element contracts. The fair value of these revenue elements is based on negotiated contracts and stand alone pricing for each element. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable. Although we believe that the current allowance is sufficient to cover existing exposures, there can be no assurance against the deterioration of a major customers creditworthiness, or against defaults that are higher than what has been experienced historically. If our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us are overstated, it could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out method. Inventory obsolescence reserves are maintained based on managements estimates, historical experience and forecasted demand for our products. A material change in these estimates could adversely impact gross profit. Warranty Costs We offer warranties on most of our products. The specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending upon the products sold. We accrue for warranty costs based on the number of units sold, the type of products sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We regularly review these forecasts and makes adjustments as needed. If we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, gross profit could be adversely affected. Goodwill We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, July 1, or at an interim date if circumstances dictate. We manage our business as five operating segments. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we determined these operating segments were our reporting units. We test each reporting unit for possible goodwill impairment by comparing each reporting units net book value to fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses as well as fair value on a comparable business basis. We use both the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method and the Comparable Business (CB) method for determining fair value of our reporting units. The CB method is a valuation technique by which the fair value of the equity of a business is estimated by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. The multiples of key metrics of other similar companies (revenue and or EBITDA) are generally applied to the historical or projected results of the business being valued to determine its fair market value. The DCF method considers the future cash flow projections of the business and the value of those projections discounted to the present day. While the use of historical results and future projections can result in different valuations for a company, it is a generally accepted valuation practice to apply more than one valuation technique to establish a range of values for a business. Since each technique relies on different inputs and assumptions, it is unlikely that each technique would yield the same results. However, it is expected that the different techniques would establish a reasonable range. On at least an annual basis, we assess the current business environment, changes in the operations of each reporting unit, deviations from projected results, and the results of the prior year goodwill impairment test. We then determine if the DCF method, the CB method or both will be used in performing the current year goodwill impairment test. When both methods are used for a reporting unit, we consider the similarities of each valuation to the underlying business to determine the weight given to each method. In 2007 and 2006, we weighted the two methods equally in determining the value of the reporting units that used both methods because we believe both methods have an equal probability of providing an appropriate fair value. In fiscal 2007, we used both the DCF and the CB method for all five of our reporting units. In fiscal 2006, we used the DCF method for all reporting units and the CB method for Base Station Subsystems, Wireless Innovations and Satellite Communications as these represented managements best estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit. 34 Table of Contents When using the CB method, we select comparable companies that operate in the same market place as the reporting unit. Because of the limited number of companies that operate in the same market and are of the same size as the reporting unit, we focus on companies that closely match the reporting unit from a product offering and customer base standpoint, regardless of size. When considering the multiples of the comparable companies, we factor in the size of the comparable companies when selecting the appropriate multiple to use in the valuation. Generally, the CB method has resulted in a higher valuation of our reporting units than the DCF method. This is indicative of the future prospects and higher values that the market places on companies that operate in our industry. Although our cash flow forecasts used in the DCF method are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives. If actual results are different from our forecasts, future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill, which could result in non cash charges, adversely affecting our results of operations. In fiscal 2007, we recorded asset impairment charges related to goodwill for two of our reporting units. We recorded an impairment charge for Base Stations Subsystems due to an interim test of goodwill and we recorded an impairment of Satellite Communications goodwill based on our annual impairment test. As a result of the losses generated by the Base Station Subsystems reporting unit in the first six months of fiscal 2007 in excess of our plan, we determined that a potential indicator of impairment had occurred and an interim test for goodwill impairment was required. We performed a step one impairment test, in accordance with paragraph 19 of SFAS 142, on this reporting unit as of March 31, 2007. Based on the test, we determined that a potential indicator of impairment existed and a step two test, in accordance with SFAS 142, was required. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the step two test of the Base Station Subsystems reporting unit and recorded an impairment charge of $108 million. In fiscal 2007, decreased spending levels from two major customers caused us to reevaluate our projected level of sales, earnings and cash flows for the Base Station Subsystems reporting unit. This review resulted in a reduction in projected sales, operating earnings and cash flows, as compared to the July 1, 2006 valuation. The July 1, 2006, valuation included higher sales volumes and a projected sales mix that was more dependent on historically lower margin high volume products. The sales and operating earning projections in the March 31, 2007 valuation include a more focused rationalization of product lines which had the primary effect of decreasing projected sales levels over the next several years. The lower market multiples were based on Base Station Subsystems size and operating results compared to other market participants. The assumptions used in the valuation of Base Station Subsystems as of March 31, 2007 were also used for the July 1, 2007 valuation (listed below). As a result of the announced plan to sell the Satellite Communications business in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we determined a potential indicator of impairment had occurred and an interim test of goodwill was required. We determined at the time that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no impairment existed. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we reevaluated the Satellite Communications business and determined that, as a result of continuing operating losses and lower short term business prospects as compared to previous forecasts, and, despite significant numbers of initial indications of interest, the low number of then remaining substantive bids that had resulted from our effort to sell the Satellite Communications business, the fair value of the Satellite Communications reporting unit was less than its carrying value and an indicator of impairment existed. We performed step two of the goodwill impairment test and recorded an impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, reducing the balance of the Satellite Communications goodwill to zero.

(b) For the 2005 Satellite Communications and Network Solutions valuations, the 2006 valuation of Base Station Subsystems valuation, and the 2007 Satellite Communications and Base Station Subsystems valuations we applied the multiples to projected revenue and EBITDA margins from our DCF model, instead of historical amounts. Historical amounts did not accurately reflect changes in the business and the projected amounts were considered a more accurate view of the reporting units long term performance. (c) EBITDA was not used for the CB method in 2007 as the comparable companies for Wireless Innovations provided an inconsistent range of multiples. The following table illustrates the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the amount of headroom, (which represents the percentage difference between each reporting units fair value and carrying value) as of our annual impairment test, July 1, 2007 and 2006, as follows: Goodwill Headroom (a) September 30, July 1, (In thousands) 2007 2006 2007 2006 Antenna and Cable $233,894 $196,299 154 % 24 % Satellite Communications (b) 14,207 (26 )%(c) 43 % Base Station Subsystems 308,255 411,782 13 % 6 % Network Solutions 117,000 117,178 50 % 7 % Wireless Innovations 141,866 143,200 13 % 45 % (a) Headroom (fair value carrying value)/carrying value (b) Satellite Communications goodwill was written off as of September 30, 2007 (c) As a result of the negative headroom, we had an indicator of impairment and ultimately recorded an impairment charge for Satellite Communications goodwill The increase in Antenna and Cable headroom is due primarily to the use of a lower discount rate and higher long term growth projections. The conservative nature of the projections in comparison to the historical operating results of the reporting unit, as well as market conditions surrounding the industry in which the Antenna and Cable reporting unit operates indicated a need to reduce the discount rate. Satellite Communications, as discussed above, had lower than expected results and thus lower future projections, resulting in an impairment of all of the reporting units goodwill. The decrease in Wireless Innovations headroom was the result of lower projected long term operating margins, as continued increases in revenue growth were more than offset by increased costs to achieve that growth rate. Network Solutions has continued to produce positive results; however, because of the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in the cash flow projections, there is a greater risk of potential future impairment, especially if the business is adversely impacted by the resolution of the TruePosition intellectual property matter. 37 Table of Contents If one or more of these assumptions differ from our forecasts, future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill. The following table illustrates the impact on the amount of headroom of a change to each of the critical assumptions used in the goodwill valuation for 2007: HEADROOM ANALYSIS AS OF JULY 1, 2007 Antenna and Cable SatelliteCommunications (a) Base StationSubsystems NetworkSolutions WirelessInnovations Headroom 154 % (26 )% 13 % 50 % 13 % METHOD USED TEN PERCENTAGE POINT: Decrease in Comparable Business (CB) Weighting 148 % (27 )% 12 % 46 % 11 % Increase in Comparable Business (CB) Weighting 160 % (25 )% 15 % 53 % 15 % DCF METHOD ONE PERCENTAGE POINT: Decrease in Revenue Growth Rate 150 % (27 )% 11 % 47 % 11 % Increase in Revenue Growth Rate 158 % (24 )% 15 % 53 % 15 % Decrease in EBIT Margin 145 % (38 )% 8 % 45 % 8 % Increase in EBIT Margin 163 % (13 )% 18 % 55 % 17 % Decrease in Terminal Growth Rate 143 % (29 )% 9 % 41 % 9 % Increase in Terminal Growth Rate 169 % (21 )% 19 % 61 % 18 % Decrease in Discount Rate 172 % (20 )% 20 % 63 % 19 % Increase in Discount Rate 141 % (30 )% 8 % 40 % 8 % CB METHOD TEN PERCENT: Decrease in Revenue Multiple 147 % (28 )% 10 % 44 % 6 % Increase in Revenue Multiple 162 % (23 )% 17 % 56 % 20 % Decrease in EBITDA Multiple 147 % (28 )% 10 % 44 % NA Increase in EBITDA Multiple 161 % (23 )% 17 % 55 % NA FIVE PERCENTAGE POINT: Decrease in Control Premium 148 % (27 )% 11 % 46 % 11 % Increase in Control Premium 160 % (24 )% 15 % 53 % 15 % (a) As a result of the negative headroom, we had an indicator of impairment and ultimately recorded an impairment charge for Satellite Communications goodwill Income Taxes Our balance sheet reflects significant deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses and tax credits carried forward. To the extent management believes it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration, we are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of the deferred tax assets. The determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated. Changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances have been established for the portion of deferred tax assets representing net U.S. and Italian deferred tax assets (including book and tax asset basis differences, federal and state loss carryforwards, and federal and state tax credit carryforwards) and certain foreign loss carryforwards and book and tax asset basis differences in jurisdictions where management feels future realization is sufficiently uncertain (see Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). No valuation allowances have been established for the remaining net deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, as management expects future taxable income based on a recent history of taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities will make the realization of such deferred tax assets more likely than not. We currently anticipate that we will be required to earn taxable profits of approximately $91 million in various foreign jurisdictions in order to fully utilize our remaining net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are primarily related to book and tax asset basis differences. 38 Table of Contents Restructuring At September 30, 2007, we had a restructuring reserve of $4 million for restructuring and integration activities. These accruals are based on our best estimate of the costs associated with merger integration and restructuring plans, including employee termination costs, lease cancellations, and other costs. If actual costs of these activities differ significantly from these estimates, results of operations could be impacted. Defined Benefit Plans Some of our employees are covered by defined benefit plans. Approximately 700 current and former employees of our United Kingdom subsidiary, Andrew Ltd., participate in a defined benefit plan. The costs and obligations recorded for these plans are dependent upon actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest costs, expected compensation increases, benefits earned, mortality rates, and other factors. If actual results are significantly different than those forecasted or if future changes are made to these assumptions, the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate enables management to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. We estimate that a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased benefit expense in fiscal 2007 by $2 million. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased benefit expense in fiscal 2007 by $1 million. To determine the expected return on plan assets, management considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical returns on plan assets. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets would have decreased or increased pension expense in fiscal 2007 by $1 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2007, we do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements. The term off balance sheet arrangement generally is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we have (i) made guarantees, (ii) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (iii) any obligation under certain derivative instruments or (iv) any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to a company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services within a company. 39 Table of Contents Aggregate Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of September 30, 2007, expected future cash payments under contractual obligations and commitments and the estimated timeframe in which such obligations are expected to be fulfilled were as follows: Payments Due by Period Dollars in millions Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Long term debt (a) $300 $10 $20 $20 $250 Operating leases (b) 148 26 40 27 55 Capital leases (b) 2 1 1 Purchase obligations (c) 137 122 15 Copper purchases (d) 32 32 Benefit plan obligations (e) 34 2 3 3 26 Total $653 $193 $64 $65 $331 (a) Long term debt includes maturities and interest obligations. Included in the long term debt obligations are $240 million of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes due fiscal 2013. We may not redeem the notes prior to August 20, 2008, after which time we may redeem the notes at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Holders may require us to repurchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on August 15, 2008. Therefore, the $240 million convertible notes are classified as current liabilities on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 7, Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements. (b) See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of leases. (c) Purchase obligations of $137 million represent purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory, as well as other goods and services, in the ordinary course of business, and exclude balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. (d) In order to reduce our exposure to copper price fluctuations, we have entered into contracts with various suppliers to purchase approximately 17% of our forecasted copper requirements for fiscal 2008, which represents contracts to purchase 9.7 million pounds of copper for $32 million. (e) Benefit plan obligations of $34 million include estimated future contributions and benefit payments under our defined benefit and post retirement medical and life insurance plans, to the extent the plans are not sufficiently funded. See Note 6, Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of our benefit plan obligations. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. We believe that our existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position. 40 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodities as follows: Interest Rate Risk. We had $345 million in debt outstanding at September 30, 2007 in the form of debt agreements and capital lease obligations at both fixed and variable rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our variable rate debt, which totaled $96 million or 28% of our total debt. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We currently do not use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk. Our international operations represent a substantial portion of our overall operating results and asset base. In many cases, our products are produced at manufacturing facilities in foreign countries to support sales in those markets. During fiscal 2007, sales of products exported from the United States or manufactured abroad were 67% of total sales. Our identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from accounts receivable from customer sales, anticipated purchases of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily manage our foreign currency risk by making use of naturally offsetting positions that include the establishment of local manufacturing facilities that conduct business in local currency. We also selectively utilize derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of exchange fluctuations. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes. These contracts are not designated as hedges for hedge accounting and are marked to market each period. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in all non U.S. dollar currencies would have decreased or increased, respectively, reported net loss by approximately $8 million in fiscal 2007. Commodity Risk. We use various metals in the production of our products. Copper, which is used to manufacture coaxial cable, is the most significant of these metals. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the price of copper. In order to reduce this exposure, we have implemented price increases on our coaxial cable products, and have entered into forward purchase contracts with various copper suppliers. As of September 30, 2007, we entered into contracts to purchase approximately 17% of our forecasted copper requirements for fiscal 2008, which represents contracts to purchase 9.7 million pounds of copper for $32 million. We estimate that a 10% change in the price of copper could increase or decrease the cost of our forecasted fiscal 2008 copper purchases that are not under contract at September 30, 2007 by approximately $18 million. We also use certain petrochemicals for cable coatings, and a 10% change in the price of these petrochemicals would have an estimated $4 million impact on our forecasted cost of products sold in fiscal 2008. 41 Table of Contents
