Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Overview We believe we are a leading technology company that develops innovative and efficacious products for regenerative medicine. We are focused on creating innovative technology platforms that will provide us with a variety of procedural specific biologic products to address the changing needs of orthopedics and healthcare in general. By developing specific products for specific procedures, we believe we will be able to provide the surgeon with the right product at the right time for the right procedure and therefore improve patient outcomes. We are currently focused on three technologies: MagniFuse, Plexur and HCT. Each of these technologies have generated and we expect will continue to generate a variety of procedural specific products allowing us to pursue opportunities in existing and new markets. Our legacy business lines, lead by our proprietary Grafton Technology, have provided us with a base of business. These legacy business lines allow us to cover overhead and manufacturing capacity as we drive the launch of new products from the MagniFuse, Plexur and HCT technologies. We believe the MagniFuse, Plexur and HCT technology platforms will drive our future growth. 19 Table of Contents Our goal is to utilize our technology platforms to develop tissue forms and products (collectively referred to herein as Products) to create procedure specific solutions to repair, replace or heal bone and tissue loss caused by trauma, disease or surgical intervention and to augment prosthetic implant procedures, to facilitate spinal fusion and to replace and or repair damaged ligaments, tendons and other tissues within the human body. We provide our biologic solutions to orthopedic, spinal, trauma, neurosurgical and oral/maxillofacial surgeons for use in various surgical procedures. During 2009, we accomplished the following milestones furthering our efforts to transform the Company to a biologics solutions business: Early in the fourth quarter, we announced the first U.S. spinal surgery using MagnifuseTM PC (Posterior Cervical), which officially marked the start of the controlled release for a family of products based upon the MagnifuseTM technology platform. MagnifuseTM PC was utilized during a posterior cervical fusion surgery and was cited as being easy to use and intuitive with a differentiated self contained delivery system. In the fourth quarter, we signed a multi year tissue supply agreement with Community Tissue Services (CTS) with an initial term spanning 10 years. The agreement replaced a previous contract between the two companies that would have expired in 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, CTS will supply us with whole donors and cortical shafts based upon periodic forecast requirements and available tissue supply. During the fourth quarter, we announced Plexur M was had been utilized in surgeries focused on orthopedic trauma, joint replacements and oncology related procedures. Late in the fourth quarter, we submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA to obtain marketing clearance for the use of our Duratech BioRegeneration Matrix to repair or replace the dura mater in various cranial surgical procedures. We expect to receive preliminary feedback from the FDA regarding the pending application late in the first quarter of 2010. In December 2009, we entered into a $10 million secured credit facility with a bank that will serve to augment our $10.7 million cash position at December 31, 2009 should it be required. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Amount % of Sales Revenue $ 96,678 100.0 % $ 103,814 100.0 % $ 104,277 100.0 % Cost of revenue 49,108 50.8 % 48,770 47.0 % 50,555 48.5 % Gross profit 47,570 49.2 % 55,044 53.0 % 53,722 51.5 % Operating expenses: Marketing, Selling and GA 43,996 45.5 % 45,032 43.4 % 44,801 43.0 % RD 6,486 6.7 % 7,435 7.2 % 5,658 5.4 % Total Operating Expenses 50,482 52.2 % 52,467 50.5 % 50,459 48.4 % Operating income (loss) (2,912 ) 3.0 % 2,577 2.5 % 3,263 3.1 % Other expense (1,370 ) 1.4 % (111 ) 0.1 % (589 ) 0.5 % Income (loss) before income taxes (4,282 ) 4.4 % 2,466 2.4 % 2,674 2.6 % Income tax expense (benefit) (265 ) 0.2 % 263 0.3 % 57 0.1 % Net income (loss) $ (4,017 ) 4.2 % $ 2,203 2.1 % $ 2,617 2.5 % Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ (.22 ) $ .12 $ .15 Diluted $ (.22 ) $ .12 $ .15 Net Income (loss) Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4.0 million or, $.22 diluted loss per share. The net loss included gross profit of $2.8 million related to patent license fees. Compared to 2008, results of operations declined primarily as a result of the decline in revenue and a related decline in units processed which negatively impacted gross margins due to our inability to efficiently absorb fixed costs. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $2.2 million or, $0.12 diluted earnings per share, and resulted from improved gross margins, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses, as compared to 2007. Net income in 2008 also included a gain of $1.0 million from a litigation settlement and $0.5 million in license fee income while 2007 included a charge of $1.0 million related to the settlement of certain litigation. 21 Table of Contents Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue declined to $96.7 million compared to revenue of $103.8 million for the prior year due mainly to our exiting the business of processing tissue for others. We plan to focus our strategic efforts on the introduction of the new products from our technology platforms and the expansion of such products in the market and maintaining our market position of our existing product lines. The following table details the components of our revenue for the years indicated: Percent Change 2009 2008 Year Ended December 31, vs. vs. (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 DBM Segment $ 56,782 $ 61,961 $ 65,794 8 % 6 % Hybrid/Synthetic Segment 3,575 3,087 1,760 16 % 75 % Traditional Tissue Segment 21,534 20,258 17,623 6 % 15 % Spinal Allograft Segment 7,626 8,499 10,739 10 % 21 % Client Services Segment 2,143 8,201 7,621 74 % 8 % Other 5,018 1,808 740 178 % 144 % $ 96,678 $ 103,814 $ 104,277 7 % % 2009 Compared to 2008 DBM Segment revenue, which consists of revenue from the sale of Grafton DBM/Xpanse Bone Inserts and revenue from the processing of private label DBM, declined 8% in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily as a result of the anticipated loss in revenue from the temporary suspension of distributing tissue recovered by our Bulgarian subsidiary and a decline in domestic unit sales volume. Revenue from Grafton DBM/Xpanse Bone Inserts and revenue from private label DBM decreased 9% and 1%, respectively, in 2009 compared to the prior year. Revenue in the Hybrid/Synthetic Segment, which consists of revenue from our Plexur Biocomposites, Magnifuse Technology and GraftCage Spacers, increased 16% in 2009 as compared to 2008 as a result of the introduction of Plexur M and the various Magnifuse tissue products. Traditional Tissue Segment revenue generated from the worldwide distribution of allograft bone tissue grafts increased 6% in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to increased domestic unit sales volume offsetting a decline in international revenue. Revenue in the Spinal Allograft Segment decreased 10% primarily due to a decrease in domestic unit sales volume. We anticipate continued competitive challenges for our spinal allografts in 2010. Client Services Segment revenue, which is generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients, declined as expected in 2009 as compared to 2008. The revenue generated in 2009 relates mainly to the winding down of our relationship with the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF). Revenue in this segment in future years will be insignificant. Other revenue consisted mainly of $3.8 million of patent license fees in 2009 compared to $0.5 million in 2008 and revenue from the international distribution of xenograft products and miscellaneous other revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2009 domestic revenue was $ 76.9 million compared to $82.5 million in 2008, or 80% and 79% of total revenue, respectively. Excluding license fee revenue, in 2009 domestic revenue declined 11% from the prior year. The reduction in domestic revenue for 2009 mainly results from reductions in DBM revenue and client service revenue as a result of the winding down of the MTF relationship. For the year ended December 31, 2009 international revenue was $19.8 million compared to $21.4 million in 2008 or 20% and 21% of total revenue, respectively. The reduction in international revenue for 2009 mainly results from a decline in revenue from the Greek market, as a result of economic and government reimbursement conditions in Greece, and a loss of revenue in a key Asian market. We expect the Greek and Asian markets to recover slowly and therefore do not expect meaningful revenue contribution from these markets in 2010. 22 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 DBM Segment revenue declined 6% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the decline in private label revenue. Revenue from Grafton DBM/Xpanse Bone Inserts and revenue from private label DBM changed 3% and (62)%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007. Revenue from Grafton DBM was negatively impacted in 2008 as a result of a decline in average selling prices. The decline in private label revenue was primarily due to one of our private label DBM customers formally notifying us of their decision not to renew their current agreement with us upon the agreements expiration in March 2009. We recognized $0.5 million of revenue from this customer in the first quarter of 2008 and the customer did not make any purchases thereafter. Revenue in the Hybrid/Synthetic Segment increased 75% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a 139% increase in Plexur P revenue due to increased unit volume. Revenue in our Traditional Tissue Segment increased 15% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 traditional tissue revenue resulted from increased unit sales volume. Revenue in the Spinal Allograft Segment declined 21% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in unit sales volume. Client Services Segment revenue, which is generated by the processing of allograft bone tissue for our clients, mainly MTF, increased 8% in 2008 as compared to 2007. Other revenue consisted mainly of $0.5 million related to license fees, the international distribution of xenograft products and revenue from the distribution of the Kinesis BMAC system. Major Customers In 2009, no customers accounted for more than 10% of revenue. In 2008 and 2007, MTF accounted for 14% and 16%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. Our agreements with MTF expired on December 31, 2008. Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Gross Profit $ 47,570 $ 55,044 $ 53,722 Gross Margin 49.2 % 53.0 % 51.5 % In 2009 gross margin declined from the prior year level primarily due to higher per unit costs due to our inability to efficiently absorb the fixed cost base of our processing facility as a result of the lower unit sales volume. Our patent licensing arrangements contributed $2.8 million and $0.5 million to gross profits in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2008 gross margin increased over the gross margin level in the prior year, primarily due to increased unit processing volumes, processing efficiencies and better management of inventory risk exposures, such as obsolescence. 23 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Percent Change 2009 2008 Year Ended December 31, vs. vs. (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 Marketing, selling and general and administrative $ 43,996 $ 45,032 $ 44,801 2 % 1 % Research development $ 6,486 $ 7,435 $ 5,658 13 % 31 % Total $ 50,482 $ 52,467 $ 50,459 4 % 4 % Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses declined 2% in 2009 compared to the prior year. In 2009, marketing, selling and general and administrative declined primarily due to lower consulting and professional fees. In 2009, research and development expenses decreased 13% as compared to 2008, primarily due to several new tissue technologies and products moving from development to commercialization. Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses in 2008 were relatively flat compared to 2007. In 2008, we had higher non cash compensation costs for equity awards and increased marketing and selling expenses compared to the prior year, offset by lower cash based performance compensation expense. Compensation expense related to our equity award program was $1.7 million in 2008 compared to $0.9 million in 2007. Also in 2007, we incurred $1.0 million in costs associated with the settlement of and legal fees incurred in connection with certain litigation. For 2008, research and development expenses increased 31% as compared to 2007, primarily due to the costs incurred for basic research, product development and process development activities to support the technologies and products we are developing for future commercialization. Operating Income (loss) Percent Change 2009 2008 Year Ended December 31, vs. vs. (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2008 2007 DBM Segment $ 15,742 $ 18,902 $ 20,105 17 % 6 % Hybrid/Synthetic Segment (521 ) 5 277 10520 % 98 % Traditional Tissue Segment 1,272 3,666 2,470 65 % 48 % Spinal Allograft Segment 1,055 286 1,941 269 % 85 % Client Services Segment 1,166 4,454 5,744 74 % 22 % Other 2,461 1,265 334 95 % 279 % 21,175 28,578 30,871 26 % 7 % Corporate (24,087 ) (26,001 ) (27,608 ) 7 % 6 % Operating Income (loss) $ (2,912 ) $ 2,577 $ 3,263 213 % 21 % Product segment operating income is comprised of segment revenue less material and processing cost and selling and marketing expenses. Total product segment operating income for 2009 declined as compared to the prior year principally due to lower gross profit after giving effect to our patent licensing arrangements contributing $2.8 million and $0.5 million to product segment operating income in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Marketing and selling expenses for 2009 were relatively flat compared to 2008. As a result, in 2009 product segment operating income, as a percent of revenue, declined to 22% compared to 28% in the prior year. Costs and expenses associated with Corporate for the year ended December 31, 2009 declined 7% when compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower professional fees and lower performance compensation expense, partially offset by severance costs incurred in late 2009. Total product segment operating income of $28.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 declined 7% compared to 2007. Segment operating income was negatively impacted by higher selling and marketing expenses which were partially offset by a higher gross margins including the effect of $0.5 million in license fee revenue. In 2008 product segment operating income as a percentage of revenue was 28% compared to 30% in the prior year. 24 Table of Contents Costs and expenses associated with Corporate Segment declined 6% for 2008 compared to 2007. In 2008, higher research and development expenses were offset by lower performance compensation expenses while in 2007, we also incurred a litigation settlement of $1.0 million. Other Income (Expense) For the year ended December 31, 2009, other expense of $1.4 million is primarily related to interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income, miscellaneous income and expenses and foreign exchange gains and losses were not significant. For the year ended December 31, 2008, other expenses of $0.1 million primarily represents $1.5 million in interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation offset partially by interest income of $0.4 million and litigation settlement income of $1.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, aggregate foreign exchange gains and losses were not significant. For the year ended December 31, 2007, other expenses of $0.6 million represents $1.6 million of interest expense associated with our capital lease obligation, partially offset by interest income on invested cash balances of $1.0 million. Future foreign exchange gains and losses, including those related to intercompany debt, may have a material impact on our results of operations in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, although the impact of such gains and losses should not have any impact on consolidated cash flows. Income Tax Provision In 2009, as a result of incurring a loss for Federal tax purposes we did not provide for Federal income taxes but did provide a provision for certain state taxes on alternative methods and for foreign taxes. In addition, as a result of settlement of various uncertain tax positions during 2009, the Company recorded an income tax benefit for Federal, state and foreign taxes of $522. In 2008 and 2007, after the application of available net operating loss carryforwards, we provided for Federal income taxes based on the alternative minimum tax method, as well as provided a provision for certain state taxes on alternative methods and foreign taxes. In 2008, we also recorded a charge related to our assessment of uncertain tax positions mainly as a result of an ongoing Federal tax audit. The carryforwards utilized for Federal, state and foreign purposes carried full valuation allowances. Our state income tax benefit in 2007 was primarily due to the reversal of certain domestic state tax reserves and the filing for a state tax refund related to a prior year, partially offset by a provision for minimum state taxes in certain jurisdictions. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company evaluated the continuing need for valuation allowances for its domestic and foreign deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic (Codification) ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. The Company has determined, based on its assessment, that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of such valuation allowances. The Company intends to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances. The Company evaluates its position with respect to the valuation allowance each quarter by taking into consideration numerous factors, including, but not limited to: past, present and forecasted results; the impact in each jurisdiction of operation activities; and the anticipated effects of the Companys strategic plan. We file U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The 2003 through 2009 tax years generally remain subject to examination by Federal, foreign and most state authorities including, but not limited to, the United States, France, Bulgaria and the State of New Jersey. During 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of our 2003 through 2005 Federal tax returns, the State of New Jerseys examination of our 2003 through 2006 state income tax filings and the French tax authoritys audit of the 2006 and 2007 tax filings by our French subsidiary were concluded. The audits resulted in the payment of a minor amount of taxes as a result of the French tax audit. The aggregate amount of our available Federal and State of New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) was not materially impacted. Certain Federal research and development credit carryforwards were eliminated. 25 Table of Contents The components of our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) are substantially comprised of deferred tax assets which are subject to a full valuation allowance. If we prevail in matters for which either a receivable or a liability for a UTB has been established, we are required to pay an amount or utilize NOLs to settle a tax liability, or estimates regarding a UTB change as a result in changes in facts and circumstances, our effective tax rate in a given financial reporting period may be affected. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of UTBs is as follows: (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Unrecognized Tax Benefits, January 1 (excluding interest and penalties) $ 3,854 $ 3,672 $ Additions related to current period tax positions 57 Additions related to prior period tax positions 853 3,615 Reductions related to prior periods tax positions (751 ) (671 ) Reductions related to settlements with taxing authorities (2,378 ) Reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations (663 ) Unrecognized Tax Benefits, December 31 $ 62 $ 3,854 $ 3,672 Accrued interest and penalties, January 1 $ 120 $ $ Additions/reductions charged to expense 120 Reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations (120 ) Accrued interest and penalties, December 31 $ $ 120 $ At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the reduction in net Federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets as a result of UTBs was offset by a similar change in the related valuation allowance. It is expected that the amount of UTBs will change in the next twelve months; however, we do not anticipate the change to be significant. Liquidity and Capital Resources December 31, December 31, (in thousands) 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 10,708 $ 18,823 Working Capital $ 53,301 $ 55,624 Stockholders equity $ 80,286 $ 82,850 Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Summary of cash flow: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (4,955 ) $ 3,373 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,248 ) $ (6,836 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (948 ) $ (454 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash $ 36 $ (37 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (8,115 ) $ (3,954 ) Cash Flow From Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $5.0 million in 2009 compared to $3.4 million provided by operating activities in 2008. The change resulted primarily from the net loss for 2009 compared to a profit in the prior year and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.5 million. During 2009, we increased our investment in tissue inventories by $.7 million. In 2008, we increased our investment in additional tissue inventories by $12.4 which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 million in 2009 compared to $6.8 million in the prior year and principally relates to the funding of capital expenditures and intellectual property. In 2008 capital expenditures included the implementation of a new enterprise software system and expenditures for production equipment and facilities for new products. We anticipate that for 2010, the funding of capital expenditures and patent development will be relatively consistent with our 2009 levels. 26 Table of Contents Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $0.9 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Principal payments on our capital lease obligation were $0.9 million and $0.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2008, cash inflows of $0.5 million were generated from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. Repurchase of Common Stock In December 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $5.0 million of shares of our common stock may be acquired. Stock repurchases may be executed from time to time at current market prices through open market and privately negotiated transactions in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The final number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the level of our cash and cash equivalents, price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. The repurchase program may be terminated at any time without prior notice. During the first quarter of 2009, we repurchased 50,480 shares with an average price paid of $2.02 per share. We made no repurchases during the balance of 2009. Through December 31, 2009, we had acquired 115,670 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $1.96 per share. Further Liquidity and Financing Needs At December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents were $10.7 million, a decline of $8.1 million from cash and cash equivalents of $18.8 million at December 31, 2008. The decline in cash during 2009 was primarily attributable to the net loss, payments to vendors, funding capital expenditures and making required principal payments on our capital lease obligation. For 2010, we have instituted plans to recover some of our investments in working capital, but we will still fund additional investments in capital expenditures and make payments under the capital lease obligation. We are instituting cost reduction programs to align our infrastructure and initiatives with the size of our revenue base. In addition, we are currently focused on the launch of several new tissue products from our new, proprietary technology platforms which we believe will provide revenue growth in future periods. Revenue growth is the most important factor in achieving the benefits of our internal financial model by leveraging our processing operation and back office infrastructure. All of these efforts are important components of our plan to reduce the cash burn rate. Based on our current projections and estimates, we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents, credit facility, cash generated from operations and the favorable cash impact from the actions noted above will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs for the next twelve months. We can provide no assurance our efforts will be successful to recover some of the investments we have made in working capital, that our cost reduction programs will be effective, that our new products will be accepted in the market or that we will realize the benefits of our internal financial model. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including: the progress of our product launches and product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals, if any, which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development; and the resources we devote to the development, manufacture and marketing of our services and products. Should we not attain our current projections and estimates, the pace of new product introductions and development can be effected. We may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans. We can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available or, if available, that such funds will be available on favorable terms. 27 Table of Contents Credit Facility On December 29, 2009, we entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association as lender and agent (PNC). Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and upon request, we may borrow from PNC up to $10.0 million subject to a maximum borrowing base that is based upon an amount equal to 85% of our eligible receivables (as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement) less such reserves as PNC reasonably deems proper and necessary. Under the Credit Agreement, we are permitted to use the proceeds of any such borrowings to satisfy our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at one of three variable rates; PNCs base commercial lending rate plus 2%; the federal funds open rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 3%. In no event will the interest rate be less than 3%. Borrowings are secured by essentially all our assets. Under the Credit Agreement, we are obligated to pay PNC a quarterly facility fee of 0.5% per annum on the unused portion of the Credit Agreement. We are also required to maintain compliance with various financial and other covenants and conditions, including but not limited to, a prohibition on paying cash dividends, a requirement that a fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained beginning on March 31, 2011, and certain limitations on engaging in affiliate transactions, making acquisitions, incurring additional indebtedness and making capital expenditures, the breach of any of which would permit PNC to accelerate the obligations. The Credit Facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions. Such provisions are based upon, in the reasonable opinion of PNC, the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs, financial or otherwise, of us, which impairs the interest of PNC. As of December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and we are in compliance with all covenants. Net Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2009, we had aggregate federal net operating loss carryforwards of $22.0 million and federal research and development and alternative minimum tax credits of $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2025 through 2030. At December 31, 2009, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $30.0 million. State net operating loss carryforwards, which primarily offset New Jersey taxable income, expire in varying amounts beginning in 2012 through 2030. In addition, we had state research and development, manufacturing and other credits of $1.1 primarily to offset New Jersey income taxes, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2010 through 2015. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.

(3) Represents the minimum reimbursement to be made under our agreement with a supplier for their services of donor recovery and donor eligibility related to the allograft bone tissue to be supplied to us over the current term of the agreement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available. These estimates generally include those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories including purchase commitments, deferred processing costs including reserves for rework, excess and obsolescence, long lived assets, asset retirement obligations, income taxes, stock based compensation, contingencies and litigation. We base the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience. If future returns are less than historical experience, a reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue. Alternatively, should returns exceed historical experience, additional allowances would be required, which would reduce revenue. Historically, the amount of returns has not been material. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period operating costs. 29 Table of Contents We recognize patent license fees as other revenue when our performance under the applicable agreement is substantially complete and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue for nonmonetary transactions based on the fair value of the asset received or surrendered, whichever is more clearly evident. We write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess, obsolescence or unmarketable tissue grafts and products equal to the lower of cost or market value. Excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the competitive nature of the market, technological change, expiration and changes in surgeon preference. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required, including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value. In each period, we also assess our production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity, and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs. In periods where our actual process activities are less than historical experience and deemed abnormal, we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we provide reserves, if any, for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues. If actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management, additional reserves may be required; alternatively, if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management, such reserves would be reduced. We continually monitor events and circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets, including property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of long lived assets, other than goodwill, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, or discounted estimated future cash flows if fair value is not readily determinable. Goodwill is tested for impairment, based on fair market value measurements, on an annual basis as of January 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented. The estimates of fair market value and future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual fair market value and cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. We record an asset retirement obligation when an obligation to retire an asset is determined. The asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, if appropriate. We determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and make adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage of time or revisions to either the timing or the amount of the undiscounted cost estimate to retire the asset. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income, in the event that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. We accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income, tax planning strategies, and assessments of the timing of taxability of the tax attributes. We provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon managements assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. 30 Table of Contents We measure stock based compensation cost at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award, which is recognized as an expense generally on a straight line basis over the employees or consultants requisite service period with an equal amount recorded as additional paid in capital, net of income tax benefit, if any, until such time as the fair value has been fully recognized. We account for forfeitures using an estimated rate when determining the fair value of the award. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of pending litigation. When we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability, if any, which may result from any of the pending litigation, we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability, and if appropriate, will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance. If the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than accrued, an expense will be recorded in the period the determination is made. Alternatively, should the outcome or resolution be for less than accrued, we would reduce the expense in the period the determination is made. Recent Accounting Developments From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. Effective for us beginning September 15, 2009, the FASB Codification is the source of authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be applied to nongovernmental entities and rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification superseded all the existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and subsequently, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts but rather issues accounting standards updates. The adoption of the Codification had no material impact on our financial statements. Impact of Inflation and Foreign Currency Exchange Fluctuations The results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies, primarily the euro. As our foreign source revenue grows and represents a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits, foreign currency transaction adjustments may impact our operating results to a greater extent. The majority of our sales to international stocking distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Generally, our results of operations are directly or indirectly positively impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro or a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the other local foreign currencies in countries to which we sell. During the first half of 2009, the U.S. dollar remained flat against the euro whereas during later half of 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro resulting in a foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million for the year. During 2008, the U.S. dollar fluctuated significantly versus the euro especially during the last quarter of the year. At December 31, 2008, the U.S. dollar closed 5% above the prior year end level. However, the average exchange rate for the year was effectively equal to the closing rate at December 31, 2008. As a result of the timing of our various transactions denominated in euros, in 2008 we recognized $0.1 million in foreign exchange losses. In 2007, we recognized foreign currency losses, primarily related to the impact of exchange rates on intercompany indebtedness, of $0.8 million. Litigation We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. For a complete discussion of these matters, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings of Part I of this Form 10 K and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10 K. It is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits. 31 Table of Contents Government Proceedings In December 2008, we were advised that during a November 2008 inspection of donor recovery sites in Bulgaria by the French regulatory agency, afssaps, deficiencies were identified. As a precautionary measure, we temporarily suspended the distribution of allograft tissue grafts processed from tissue recovered by our subsidiary, TB OsteoCentre Bulgaria EAD (OCBG). During the third quarter of 2009, as a result of a notice from afssaps we began the shipment of allograft tissue grafts processed from tissue recovered by OCBG. Suspension of shipment of these products had been self imposed by us since December 2008 as a result of deficiencies unrelated to product contamination. We however, need to complete additional procedures, which we expect to complete in mid 2010, before we release a remaining $500,000 in tissue product. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent, belief or current expectations of Osteotech and our management. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement. We desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions. Accordingly, we have identified in Item 1A of this Form 10 K important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents. We do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this Form 10 K to conform them to actual results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. We do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash or cash equivalents. Accordingly, we are subject to changes in interest rates. Based on our December 31, 2009 cash and cash equivalents, a 1% change in interest rates would impact net income by approximately $0.1 million. Our Credit Agreement entered into in December 2009 is a variable rate facility and as such, the interest cost, should we draw against the facility is, therefore, variable. Credit Risks We sell our products to hospitals in the United States and to stocking distributors internationally. Stocking distributors in turn sell to hospitals or other medical establishments and, in many instances, individual stocking distributors maintain higher individual balances with longer payment terms. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, international stocking distributors accounted for 41% and 30%, respectively, of our accounts receivable. Loss, termination or changes in financial condition of a distributor, as well as a change in medical reimbursement regimens by foreign governments where our products are sold, along with changes in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate; or changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, in international countries where our distributors operate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Foreign Exchange Risks Generally, sales to international stocking distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, in certain instances, we invoice in currencies other than U.S. dollars and also, to a lesser extent, make purchases denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We therefore are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuations, which we do not hedge, and are subject to transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component of other income in the determination of net income. Additionally, the assets and liabilities of our non U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates, while related revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month in which related transactions occur. Translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income. 32 Table of Contents
