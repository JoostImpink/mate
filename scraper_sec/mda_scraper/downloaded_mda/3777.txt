ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary The Company develops, produces, markets and sells innovative, over the counter (OTC) healthcare products with an emphasis on those that utilize unique, novel and or proprietary delivery systems that provide consumers with Better ways to get Better. The Company currently markets its products within the $4.0 billion overall cough and cold category at retail. Our Zicam products are sold in the cold (3 nasal delivery products and 5 oral delivery products), allergy/sinus (3 Zicam nasal delivery), cough (cough sprays and RapidMelt tablets), and multi symptom relief (4 oral delivery products) market groups of the overall cough and cold category. Our Nasal Comfort products are generally sold within the space allocated for allergy and sinus products at retail. We expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within the market groups. Our products are currently available at all of the major food, drug, and mass merchant retailers. The following table details our sales by product class with further details below: Product Class 2006 % 2005 % 2004 % Cold Remedy $ 69,046,345 72 % $ 55,292,673 61 % $ 39,249,136 65 % Allergy/Sinus/Nasal Comfort $ 15,468,683 16 % $ 20,163,688 23 % $ 13,357,491 22 % Cough $ 6,059,285 6 % $ 6,514,769 7 % $ 7,624,308 13 % Multi Symptom Cold/Flu $ 5,656,467 6 % $ 8,489,465 9 % $ 0 n/a Total Net Sales $ 96,230,780 100 % $ 90,460,595 100 % $ 60,230,935 100 % Net sales for 2006 increased to approximately $96.2 million, or 6% above net sales in 2005 of $90.5 million. The increase in net sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of our Cold Remedy line of products, which 20 Table of Contents include the two new Zicam Cold Remedy items that we began shipping in the third quarter of 2006 (Zicam Cold Remedy RapidMelts + Vitamin C and Zicam Cold Remedy ChewCaps). Sales of Zicam Cold Remedy products grew 25% and represented approximately 72% of our net sales. Additionally, sales of allergy/sinus products grew 1% in 2006; returns of Nasal Comfort products in 2006 exceeded sales by approximately $586,000. Cough and multi symptom cold/flu product sales declined approximately 7% and 33%, respectively, in 2006. We began television advertising of our cough and multi symptom cold/flu products in January of 2007. We expect the Zicam brand will continue to grow as we promote consumer awareness of our products, increase distribution of our products, and introduce new items. Net income for 2006 was approximately $4.9 million compared to $3.1 million in 2005. Net income for 2005 included the impact of settling the Arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining product liability lawsuits. The settlement impact was $12.0 million to settle the Arizona litigation and $1.3 million as a reserve for the remaining litigation, less approximately $4.8 million for insurance reimbursement, resulting in an $8.5 million ($5.0 million net of tax) charge (See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings). We expect net income in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales, the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses, and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in the defense of product liability matters. Expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in future periods than the amounts incurred in the same period in earlier years. We expect that advertising expenses will be highest in the fourth and first calendar quarters in conjunction with the cough and cold season. We anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales and the level of marketing and research and development activities. Because of the seasonality of our business, our Board of Directors has approved a change in our fiscal year in order to better align our operations and financial results with the entire cold season (our current fiscal year ends in the middle of the cold season). Our new fiscal year will begin April 1, 2007 and end on March 31, 2008. As in prior years, we believe the second calendar quarter of 2007 will result in a loss. The Companys management reviews several key indicators in evaluating overall performance: 1) We compare our year to date sales and net income performance against our stated annual goal for each. For fiscal 2006, our stated goal was to grow sales 25% to 35% and net income 15% to 25% above the level realized in 2005 (excluding the impact of an $8.5 million charge, net of expected recovery from insurance programs, recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 for settling the Arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining product liability lawsuits). We realized net sales growth of 6% in 2006. We believe the lower than expected sales growth is attributable to a slow start to the 2006/2007 cold season, sales of cough and multi symptom cold/flu items not achieving expected growth rates, and low acceptance of Nasal Comfort. The lower than originally anticipated net income growth is directly related to the lower sales growth we recorded. 2) We monitor our share of the cough and cold market. For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2006, retail sales of our products (as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data, not including our largest customer, Wal Mart) increased approximately 19% over the comparable period in the previous year, while the entire cough and cold category increased approximately 1% over the same period. The increased sales of our products for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2006 achieved a share of approximately 2.7% of the entire cough and cold market compared to a share of 2.3% in 2005, and 1.7% in 2004. 3) We measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products. During 2006, we achieved an average gross margin of 66%, which is below our goal of 70%, and below the average gross margin of 69% realized in 2005 (gross margins on our existing products vary between 50% and 80%). Average gross margins in 2006 were negatively impacted by higher than expected returns of Nasal Comfort and discontinued items, as well as start up costs related to new products and enhancements to existing items. 4) We evaluate our operating performance by reviewing, over time, our ability to decrease administrative and general costs as a percentage of net sales. For 2006, our operating expenses (excluding R&D and product liability litigation related charges) were approximately 48% of our net sales compared to 46% in 2005. Operating expenses for the year, as a percentage of net sales, have been negatively impacted by lower than 21 Table of Contents expected sales growth. Additionally, in 2006, we recorded approximately $800,000, or 1% of net sales, for expense related to responding to the FTC inquiry, which the FTC recently advised us it is no longer pursuing (see Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings FTC Inquiry). 5) We review the distribution of our products by key national retailers. Our ten largest retail customers (based on 2006 sales) carry, on average, 14 of our products (Zicam & Nasal Comfort). Those customers accounted for approximately 73% of our net sales in 2006 and 69% of net sales in 2005. Seasonality and Quarterly Results The products we currently market are seasonal in nature, and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population suffering from colds rises. The Company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities. During the third calendar quarter, the Company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season. Additional sales (re orders) to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population. Retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season, which usually runs from October through March. The Company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the fourth and first quarters of each year. The April to June quarter of each year generally accounts for less than 10% of annual sales. Further, the Company records the expense for annual bonuses awards when goal attainment for the bonus is reached, which is generally reflected in fourth quarter results. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Certain information is set forth below for our quarterly and fiscal operations expressed in $000s and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated: Quarterly Results: 2006 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2006 % NS 2006 % NS 2006 % NS 2006 % NS 2006 % NS $000s Net Sales $ 17,676 $ 8,206 $ 34,121 $ 36,227 $ 96,230 Marketing $ 6,699 38 % $ 1,792 22 % $ 4,136 12 % $ 18,912 52 % $ 31,539 33 % Sales Expense $ 568 3 % $ 336 4 % $ 1,272 4 % $ 1,126 3 % $ 3,302 3 % General & Administrative $ 2,302 13 % $ 3,334 40 % $ 2,925 9 % $ 2,587 7 % $ 11,148 12 % Legal Product Liability $ 1,123 6 % $ 2,117 26 % $ 1,576 5 % $ 1,141 3 % $ 5,957 6 % Total Op Expenses $ 10,692 61 % $ 7,579 92 % $ 9,909 29 % $ 23,766 65 % $ 51,946 54 % R&D $ 1,127 6 % $ 1,863 23 % $ 1,150 3 % $ 545 2 % $ 4,685 5 % 2005 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2005 % NS 2005 % NS 2005 % NS 2005 % NS 2005 % NS $000s Net Sales $ 14,982 $ 6,255 $ 25,203 $ 44,022 $ 90,461 Marketing $ 5,069 34 % $ 1,668 27 % $ 1,981 8 % $ 16,284 37 % $ 25,002 28 % Sales Expense $ 614 4 % $ 431 7 % $ 1,233 5 % $ 3,038 7 % $ 5,316 6 % General & Administrative $ 2,232 15 % $ 1,834 29 % $ 2,277 9 % $ 4,899 11 % $ 11,242 12 % Legal Product Liability $ 909 6 % $ 596 10 % $ 1,517 6 % $ 9,615 22 % $ 12,637 14 % Total Op Expenses $ 8,823 59 % $ 4,529 73 % $ 7,008 28 % $ 33,836 77 % $ 54,197 60 % R&D $ 500 3 % $ 966 15 % $ 784 3 % $ 1,820 4 % $ 4,069 4 % 22 Table of Contents As noted previously, fiscal 2005 product liability litigation reflects $2 million in reimbursement from insurance carriers ($800,000 in Q1, $600,000 in Q2, $300,000 in Q3, and $300,000 in Q4) for defense costs. Additionally fourth quarter 2005 expense reflects recognition of approximately $8.5 million as expense related to settling the Arizona litigation and recording a reserve for the remaining lawsuits ($12.0 million settlement plus $1.3 million for litigation reserves, less $4.8 million of insurance reimbursement). 2004 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2004 % NS 2004 % NS 2004 % NS 2004 % NS 2004 % NS $000s Net Sales $ 12,933 $ 3,392 $ 16,905 $ 27,002 $ 60,231 Marketing $ 4,771 37 % $ 1,216 36 % $ 1,313 8 % $ 9,427 35 % $ 16,726 28 % Sales Expense $ 665 5 % $ 123 4 % $ 862 5 % $ 1,406 5 % $ 3,056 5 % General & Administrative $ 1,981 15 % $ 1,377 41 % $ 1,604 9 % $ 3,347 13 % $ 8,309 14 % Legal Product Liability $ 0 0 % $ 756 22 % $ 1,650 10 % $ 1,365 5 % $ 3,771 6 % Total Op Expenses $ 7,417 57 % $ 3,471 103 % $ 5,429 32 % $ 15,545 58 % $ 31,862 53 % R&D $ 470 4 % $ 522 15 % $ 354 2 % $ 541 2 % $ 1,887 3 % Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill, accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition, accounting for sales returns and allowances associated with our products, and accounting for legal contingencies. Intangible Assets and Goodwill: We recorded approximately $15.0 million in goodwill in connection with the 40% Zicam, LLC interest acquired from Zensano, Inc. in December 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill must be tested when a triggering event occurs or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss. Factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share, a general decline in Zicam product sales, higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters. Any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of Zicam, LLC, or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting Zicam, LLC, could result in an impairment charge, and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our annual valuation of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of 2006 and no impairment was identified. No triggering events have occurred subsequent to the valuation performed in the third quarter of 2006. Income Taxes: In 2005 and 2006, we recorded income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods. In 2005, we fully utilized the tax loss carryforward from prior years. In 2006, we recognized a tax benefit related to the charitable donation of cough products in the second quarter of 2006. We ended 2006 with a tax loss carryforward that we expect to fully utilize in 2007. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when earned, that is, when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which is considered to have occurred upon shipment of finished product. Sales incentives, promotional allowances, and returns are estimated and recognized at 23 Table of Contents the date of shipment based upon historical activity and agreements with customers. The Company evaluates these estimates on a monthly basis and revises them as necessary. Customer Sales Returns and Allowances: The estimate for product returns reflects our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns. Prior to July 2006, we recorded a returns provision of 3% for products in distribution over a year and 7% for new items. We regularly review the similarities and differences of the new products relative to products for which we now have several years of product return experience. In July 2006, we adjusted our returns provision to 3.5% of gross sales for all of our products, including the new items that began shipping in the third quarter of 2006. Additionally, during 2006, we recorded a $2.5 million adjustment to our returns provision to account for increased returns of Nasal Comfort and discontinued products from a large customer. We will review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust the reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop. Should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates, our operating and financial results would be materially affected. Legal Contingencies: We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business. See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings for information regarding our pending litigation. While we are vigorously defending ourself in these proceedings, the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty. At the end of fiscal 2005, the Company has established a reserve of approximately $1.3 million solely for any future payment of settlement or losses related to the cold remedy litigation. This reserve was based on certain assumptions and was the amount that the Company believed that it could reasonably estimate would be spent to resolve the remaining cases. Some of the significant factors that were considered in the establishment of the reserve were: the actual costs incurred by the Company up to that time in resolving several claims; the development of the Companys legal defense strategy and structure in light of the Arizona settlement; and the number of cases that remain pending against the Company. There are events, such as the dismissal of any cases, the outcome of a trial, or rulings on pending evidentiary motions, that may have an impact on the Companys conclusions as to the adequacy of the reserves for the pending product liability lawsuits. Based on the number of pending and settled cases, the Company maintained a reserve of approximately $1.2 million on December 31, 2006. The Company will continue to review the adequacy of the associated reserves on a quarterly basis. The Company followed the guidance of SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, which states the Company is required to accrue a contingent loss when the loss is deemed probable. Results Of Operations For The Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared To The Year Ended December 31, 2005 Certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in $000s and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Net sales $ 96,230 100 % $ 90,460 100 % Cost of sales 32,445 34 28,201 31 Gross profit 63,785 66 62,259 69 Operating expenses 51,946 54 54,196 60 Research & development 4,685 5 4,069 5 Income from operations 7,154 7 3,994 4 Interest and other income 502 1 417 Interest expense 117 Income before income taxes 7,539 8 4,411 4 Provision for income taxes 2,612 3 1,333 1 Net income $ 4,927 5 % $ 3,078 3 % 24 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales for 2006 increased to approximately $96.2 million or 6% above net sales of $90.5 million in 2005. The increase is principally due to an increase in the number of units sold. We did not change the list price for our products during 2006. The increase in net sales is attributable to unit sales growth of Cold Remedy products, primarily oral delivery. We believe the increase in net sales was less than expected due to the slow start to the cold season in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales of our cough and multi symptom cold/flu relief products declined in 2006. We have begun new advertising for these products and anticipate sales increasing in the future. We experienced a large amount of Nasal Comfort returns in 2006 resulting in returns exceeding net sales for these products. We are investigating options to increase consumer acceptance of Nasal Comfort. Cost of Sales The cost of sales for 2006 increased approximately $4.2 million or 15% over the cost of sales in 2005. The increase is due to the higher number of units sold, as well as a higher average unit cost, in 2006. The cost per unit sold in 2006 increased approximately 6% compared to the cost per unit sold in 2005. Cost of goods sold were negatively affected by commercialization of new products, and higher costs associated with increased promotional displays. We expect unit cost reductions in 2007 due to the enhancements in the manufacturing process for our new swab and multi symptom relief products. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2006 increased to approximately $63.8 million or $1.5 million above gross profit in 2005. The increased gross profit is due to the increased sales, partially offset by the higher cost per unit sold. The gross margin percentage achieved in 2006 decreased to 66% compared to the gross margin achieved in 2005 of 69%. The gross margin percentage on our current product offerings vary between 50% and 80%; therefore our average gross margin is affected by the relative mix of products sold. Our average gross margin percentage was below our goal of 70% primarily due to start up costs for new items, a $2.5 million adjustment to our returns provision to account for increased returns of Nasal Comfort and discontinued products, and increased costs for promotional displays. Operating Expenses Operating expense for 2006 decreased to approximately $51.9 million from $54.2 million in 2005. Operating expense for 2006 decreased to approximately $51.9 million from $54.2 million in 2005, principally due to a decrease in product liability expense. In 2005, we recorded charges of $12 million to settle the Arizona litigation (less $4.8 million in expected insurance reimbursement) and $1.3 million to establish a reserve for the remaining litigation. This net decrease in cost of $8.5 million from 2005 was partially offset in 2006 by an increase in defense costs from $4.2 million in 2005 ($6.2 million less $2.0 million in expected insurance recoveries ) to $6.0 million in 2006. Legal costs in 2006 were also impacted by the cost of responding to the inquiry by the FTC. During 2006 marketing and advertising expense increased $6.5 million (approximately $31.5 million in 2006 compared to $25.0 million in 2005). Advertising expense increased approximately $5.5 million to $25.3 million in 2006 from $19.8 million in 2005. Non advertising marketing expense increased $1.0 million, primarily related to consumer research, public relations, and sampling programs. Sales expense decreased $2.0 million during 2006 because bonus amounts for achieving sales goals were not earned. Similarly, labor expense decreased $1.7 million due to the failure to achieve goals related to the payment of officer and management bonuses. Operating expenses were also impacted by a $600,000 cost associated with the charitable donation of cough products in 2006. Research & Development Research and development expense increased from approximately $4.1 million in 2005 to approximately $4.7 million in 2006. Our research and development expenses were related to developing new Zicam products 25 Table of Contents introduced in 2006 and continuing work on our oral care and antacid product developments. We expect to continue investing 4% to 5% of annual net sales on our research and development efforts. Interest & Other Income Other income increased to $0.5 million in 2006, approximately $80,000 higher than 2005 due to higher interest income. Interest Expense In July 2006, we borrowed $4 million against our credit facility with Comerica Bank to fund seasonal working capital needs, resulting in approximately $116,000 in interest expense. We repaid the borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2006 and ended the year with no debt outstanding. We did not incur any interest expense during 2005. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income tax for 2006 increased to approximately $7.5 million from $4.4 million in 2005. The increase is related to the increase in sales and gross profit. Additionally, in 2005 there was an $8.5 million charge related to the settlement of litigation (net of insurance reimbursement) and the establishment of a reserve for remaining lawsuits. We expect that income in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our current products, new product introductions, and year over year changes in our advertising, research and development, and legal expenses. Provision for Income Tax Expense In 2006, we recorded a provision for income tax expense at our combined federal and state estimated, effective tax rates of 39%. We also recognized tax credits related to the charitable donation of cough product and investment in research and development. Net Income Net income increased approximately $1.8 million, or 60%, to approximately $4.9 million in 2006, compared to net income for 2005 of approximately $3.1 million. The increase reflects the higher sales and gross margin dollars in 2006. Net income in 2005 was adversely affected by litigation settlements and reserves (see Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings). 26 Table of Contents Results Of Operations For The Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared To The Year Ended December 31, 2004 Certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in $000s and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Net sales $ 90,460 100 % $ 60,231 100 % Cost of sales 28,201 31 18,405 31 Gross profit 62,259 69 41,826 69 Operating expenses 54,196 60 31,862 53 Research & development 4,069 5 1,887 3 Income from operations 3,994 4 8,077 13 Interest and other income 417 370 1 Interest expense 40 Income before income taxes 4,411 4 8,407 14 Provision for income taxes 1,333 1 3,450 6 Net income $ 3,078 3 % $ 4,957 8 % Net Sales Net sales for 2005 were approximately $90.5 million, or 50% above net sales of $60.2 million in 2004. During 2005 we did not change the list price for our products, although our cough and multi symptom flu products have a list price below our cold remedy and allergy/sinus products. Approximately 42% of the $30.2 million increase in net sales was attributable to sales of the new Zicam flu relief and Nasal Comfort products introduced in the third quarter of 2005, while approximately 53% of the increase was due to increased unit sales of our Zicam Cold Remedy products, particularly the oral products introduced in 2003. The remainder of the increase was due to a 19% increase in unit sales of Zicam allergy and sinus products, offsetting a decline of approximately $1.1 million in Zicam Cough Mist sales. Cost of Sales The cost of sales for 2005 increased approximately $9.8 million or 53% over the cost of sales in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the higher number of units sold in 2005. The cost per unit sold in 2005 increased approximately 3% compared to the cost per unit sold in 2004. The higher average cost per unit is due to higher costs for the new flu relief and Nasal Comfort products introduced during 2005. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2005 was approximately $62.3 million, or 49% above gross profit in 2004, primarily due to the increase in sales. The gross margin percentage achieved in 2005 remained unchanged from the prior years gross margin of 69%. The gross margin percentage on our products is between 50% and 80%. Gross margin will continue to be affected by the relative mix of products sold. Average gross margin percentages were below our goal of 70% primarily due to higher costs for new items, particularly our flu products, and increased freight charges. Operating Expenses Operating expense for 2005 increased to approximately $54.2 million from $31.9 million in 2004. The increase was due to $8.5 million recognized for litigation resolution ($12.0 million for the Arizona settlement plus $1.3 million as a reserve for litigation, less $4.8 million for expected reimbursement from our insurance companies). Legal expense for product liability defense increased to approximately $4.2 million ($6.2 million 27 Table of Contents for 2005 legal defense expense less $2.0 million for reimbursement from our insurance carriers for legal expenses incurred in 2004 and 2005) compared to legal expense for product liability defense of $3.8 million in 2004. Also contributing to higher expense was an increase in marketing and advertising expenses of $8.3 million (approximately $25.0 million in 2005 compared to $16.7 million in 2004). Advertising expense increased approximately $5.0 million to $19.8 million in 2005 from $14.8 million in 2004. Non advertising marketing expense increased $3.3 million, primarily related to consumer research, public relations, and sampling programs. Sales expense increased $2.3 million during 2005 primarily due to increased expense for our retail coverage and higher sales commission expense of $1.8 million. Our labor expense increased $1.8 million, which is related to the addition of 11 new employees in 2005, and the recording of year end bonuses awarded for achieving annual goals. We also experienced an increase of $1.2 million for our general and administrative expenses. The majority of this increase is due to increased quality control and customer service expense. Research and Development Research and development expense increased from approximately $1.9 million in 2004 to $4.1 million in 2005. We continue to invest in research and development efforts and remain focused on developing new products. Interest & Other Income Other income increased to $0.4 million in 2005, approximately $50,000 higher than 2004. The increase was attributable to interest income associated with our increased cash position and higher interest rates. Interest Expense We did not incur any interest expense during 2005. In July 2004, we borrowed $2 million against our credit facility with Comerica Bank, resulting in $40,000 in interest expense. We repaid the borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2004 and ended the year with no debt outstanding. Income Before Income Taxes Income before income tax for 2005 decreased 48% to approximately $4.4 million from $8.4 million in 2004. The decrease was due to the recording of $8.5 million related to the settlement of litigation and the reserve for remaining lawsuits, which offsets the increase in sales of $30.3 million and gross profit of $20.4 million. We expect that income in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our current products, new product introductions, and year over year changes in our advertising, research and development, and legal expenses. Provision for Income Tax Expense In 2005, we recorded a provision for income tax expense at our combined federal and state estimated, effective tax rates. We also recognized approximately $477,000 in tax credits. Due to our higher income base and the elimination of our tax loss carry forward, we were able to realize a credit of $302,000 for alternative minimum tax payments made in prior years and $175,000 in tax credits due to higher research and development spending. Net Income Net income decreased approximately $1.9 million, or 38%, to approximately $3.1 million in 2005 compared to net income for 2004 of approximately $5.0 million. The decrease in net income is due to our higher sales and gross margin being offset by litigation costs, settlements, and reserves. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital increased to $37.6 million as of December 31, 2006 from $27.5 million as of December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $10.1 million. During 2006, we experienced an increase in available cash of approximately $1.7 million. 28 Table of Contents The principal use of cash in operations was $12.0 million paid to settle the Arizona consolidated litigation, offset by approximately $3.4 million received for insurance reimbursements. Cash increased due to approximately $2.5 million received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. During 2006, $4.5 million of restricted cash, associated with our prior self funded insurance program, was released in April (see below) and the Company reinvested approximately $4.2 million to complete a new automated manufacturing line to produce our swab product. Additionally, during 2006 the Company acquired approximately $364,000 of tooling related to our new Zicam products, and invested $250,000 in our new research and development facility. The Companys principal source of liquidity is cash generated from sales of our products to retailers and distributors. The majority of sales are given 30 day credit terms; however, payment terms are occasionally extended, as retailers begin to increase inventory of our products prior to the onset of the cough and cold season. The Company records an estimated allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts, which is reviewed on a monthly basis. We believe our allowance as of December 31, 2006 is adequate. The change in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses largely reflects the increase in the Companys business and reflects the seasonal nature of the Companys business. The Company records the bulk of its sales, which is reflected in higher accounts receivable, in the third, fourth and first calendar quarters; builds inventory during the second through fourth quarter periods; and advertises its products, which is the largest component of accrued expenses, in the fourth and first quarters. Although affected by the build up of inventory in the second through fourth quarters, accounts payable and accrued expenses are more significantly affected by advertising spending, which largely occurs in the fourth and first quarters. Generally, to the extent our operations are profitable, our business is cash flow positive. We do have working capital requirements arising from the increase of inventory and accounts receivable in excess of the increase in accounts payable, but these vary throughout the year reflecting the seasonal nature of our business. Historically, the Company has had very low capital expenditures since we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our products. Typical capital expenditures include investments in technology, office furniture, and leasehold improvements, and small tooling requirements. However, during 2006 the Company spent approximately $4.2 million for an automated manufacturing line that will produce our swab products. In addition, the Company occasionally provides deposits and prepayments to our manufacturers to improve and increase manufacturing capabilities for our products. During 2007 the Company expects to invest approximately $500,000 in equipment for our new research and development facility. In April 2004, we established a fully funded deductible insurance program through a product liability insurance carrier. Under the program, we agreed to reimburse our insurer for its claims administration expenses and for amounts paid out by it in settlement of product liability claims filed after the initial date of the program and which are not covered by insurance programs from prior years. The terms of the program required us to maintain an irrevocable, evergreen letter of credit issued by a bank or other financial institution to secure our reimbursement obligations to our insurer. We had a $5.0 million letter of credit with Comerica Bank and had reserved an equal amount of cash to secure repayments of amounts that become due under the letter of credit. The $5.0 million reserve was classified as restricted cash on the December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet and was invested in an interest bearing certificate of deposit. The settlement of the consolidated Arizona litigation in January of 2006 exhausted this policy. In April 2006, we replaced the self funded insurance program with a limited traditional insurance program. This new insurance program does not cover lawsuits existing prior to April 2006, and only applies to any new claims made after the new policy became effective. The new policy requires a $500,000 letter of credit instead of a $5.0 million letter of credit, as was required under the previous policy. We have a $4.0 million credit facility with Comerica Bank that was renewed in 2005 and expires in July 2007. The interest rate under the new credit facility is prime plus 0.25% (or 8.5% at December 31, 2006). In July 2006, we borrowed $4 million under the facility to support our working capital requirements in the third quarter of 2006. We fully repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of 2006. We are in compliance with the earnings and financial covenants contained in the credit facility. We believe that our existing capital resources and our credit line will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the next 12 months. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We have entered into certain long term contractual obligations that will require various payments over future periods as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due by Period as of December 31, 2006 Less Than 1 3 3 5 After Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In thousands of dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Capital Lease Obligations 0 0 0 0 0 Operating Lease Obligations 687 274 315 98 0 Purchase Obligations 4,125 4,125 0 0 0 Other Long Term Liabilities Reflected on the Companys Balance Sheet under GAAP 0 0 0 0 0 Total $ 4,812 $ 4,399 $ 315 $ 98 $ 0 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to measure the cost of services received in exchange for equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award, with that cost being recognized to expense over the requisite service or vesting period. SFAS No. 123R allows for the use of the Black Scholes or a lattice option pricing model to value such equity instruments. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model in valuing such equity instruments. Upon adoption, the Company transitioned to SFAS No. 123R using the Modified Prospective Application (MPA) transition method, whereby compensation cost is recognized for new awards and awards modified after the effective date, and to that portion of outstanding awards for which part or all of the requisite service will be rendered on or after the effective date, with prior periods stock based compensation for option plan activity still presented on a pro forma basis. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, for the full year 2006, the Company recognized pre tax charges of $150,800 as compensation expense, approximately $93,000 after tax, related to unvested options as of January 1, 2006. The Company is expecting to recognize additional pre tax charges of $41,478 during 2007 in association with the non vested stock options. These charges will not affect the Companys cash position. The Company anticipates future option grants will be minimal and has a preference for granting restricted stock awards in the future. On February 7, 2005, the Companys Compensation Committee approved a new executive stock ownership requirement and approved the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options previously granted under the Companys option plans, including those granted to executive officers and directors, for which the option exercise price was above the closing price on February 7, 2005. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The interpretation applies to tax positions within the scope of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Interpretation 48 is a two step process for recognition and evaluation of tax positions. It requires the Company to assess whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and then to determine the amount of the tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company will implement Interpretation No. 48 at the beginning of its next fiscal year and transition period beginning January 1, 2007. Adoption of FIN 48 is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities that use fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 will apply whenever another US GAAP standard requires (or permits) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of 30 Table of Contents fair value to any new circumstances. We will adopt SFAS 157 in the first quarter of 2008 and have begun the process of evaluating the expected impact of SFAS 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements in determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company has adopted SAB No. 108 as of December 31, 2006 and its adoption did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. The FASB issued SFAS No. 159 to mitigate earnings volatility that arises when financial assets and liabilities are measured differently, and to expand the use of fair value measurement for financial instruments. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with Comerica Bank. At no time during fiscal 2005 did we have any outstanding balance against this line of credit. In July 2006, we borrowed $4 million against our credit facility with Comerica Bank. The primary purpose for the borrowing was to provide additional liquidity as we built inventory for expected increases in sales during the second half of 2006. We generally extend payment terms for customers during the third quarter as customers purchase new products and build inventory for the upcoming cough and cold season. We repaid the debt in the fourth quarter of 2006 and ended fiscal 2006 with no debt. Consequently, we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we did not participate in any market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107. We believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases (of which there were none in fiscal 2006) or commodity price risk.
