ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW As a result of the Aviall acquisition, the Company is now the largest and most diversified independent gas turbine engine repair and overhaul company in the world. Under current managements direction, internal growth and strategic acquisitions have increased the Companys net sales from $62.0 million in 1992 to $397.9 million in 1996. Similarly, net income has increased from $2.5 million in 1992 to $11.8 million in 1996. The 1994 acquisition of Greenwich Connecticut assets and the 1996 acquisition of the Aviall Business have diversified further the Companys servicing capabilities, adding the Pratt & Whitney JT8D 200, PW 100 and GG4, the CFM International CFM56 series, the GE CF6 80, and the International Aero Engine V2500 engine lines to the Companys service lines. Furthermore, these acquisitions have increased market share and provided access to previously unavailable markets. Income from operations as a percentage of sales has declined from 12.5% in fiscal 1993 to 8.0% in fiscal 1996. This decline primarily resulted from the acquisitions of the Greenwich Connecticut and Aviall Business assets, both of which had significantly lower operating margins than the Company at the time of such acquisitions. Also impacting operating margins were competitive pricing pressures within the Companys markets and a greater proportion of revenues generated under long term contracts. These long term contracts historically carry lower margins but provide more predictable and steady streams of revenue. No assurance can be given however, that any or all of these agreements will be renewed or extended on terms which are commercially favorable to the Company. In such connection, the renewal of a significant long term agreement with USAir, which expired in October 1996, was awarded to GE, and another long term agreement with Southwest Airlines expiring in March 1997 is currently under competitive bid. The integration of these operations has generated, and is expected to continue generating, cost savings from productivity improvements and the elimination of duplicative overhead expenses. Management believes that these factors, coupled with the Companys entrepreneurial approach and commitment to remain a high quality, efficient provider of gas turbine engine services, will enable the Company to maintain its position as a successful competitor in the global marketplace. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 1996 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1995 Net sales for fiscal year 1996 increased 102.7% to $397.9 million, from $196.3 million for fiscal year 1995. This increase is attributable primarily to the operations of the former Aviall Business, which generated net sales of approximately $162.2 million since their acquisition on June 10, 1996. In addition, revenues from the Companys pre acquisition operations increased by approximately $39.4 million, or 20% when compared to fiscal 1995. Gross profit for fiscal 1996 increased 75.2% to $55.0 million, or 13.8% of net sales, from $31.4 million or 16.0% of net sales, for fiscal 1995. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to the higher sales volume in fiscal 1996. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of work performed under long term contracts assumed from Aviall that have not been generating margins as high as the Companys pre acquisition operations. The Company is continuing the implementation of its integration plan, which is engineered to coordinate production efforts, reduce turnaround times, and minimize duplication of support functions in purchasing, technical and field services, and management information systems. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1996 increased 68.9% to $23.0 million, or 5.8% of net sales, from $13.6 million, or 6.9% of net sales for fiscal 1995. The increase was primarily due to the addition of marketing and administrative expenses in support of the increased business activity that has resulted from the acquisition of the Aviall Business, as well as the 20% increase in revenues generated by the Companys pre acquisition operations. 16 Interest expense for fiscal 1996 increased 59.2% to $12.7 million, or 3.2% of net sales, from $8.0 million, or 4.0% of net sales, for fiscal 1995, primarily due to approximately $5.0 million of interest accrued through September 30 from the sale of $160 million of 10.5% senior notes on June 5, 1996. As a result of the above factors, net income for fiscal year 1996 increased 90.2% to $11.8 million, or $.83 per share on 14.3 million average shares of Common Stock outstanding (fully diluted) compared to $6.2 million or $.54 per share on 12.8 million average shares of Common Stock outstanding (fully diluted) for fiscal year 1995. FISCAL 1995 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1994 Net sales for fiscal 1995 increased 86.6% to $196.3 million, from $105.2 million for fiscal 1994. This increase resulted from strong sales gains in all four of the Companys marketing and technical units and the Companys ability to capitalize on the trend toward outsourcing in the commercial aviation and military markets. Additionally, fiscal 1995 marked the Companys first full year of sales produced by Greenwich Connecticut, with Greenwich Connecticut sales of $72.4 million in fiscal 1995, as compared to sales of $28.9 million for only five and one half months of fiscal 1994. Gross profit for fiscal 1995 increased 81.7% to $31.4 million, or 16.0% of net sales, from $17.3 million or 16.4% of net sales, for fiscal 1994. This increase in gross profit is primarily due to the Companys increased net sales during the period. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the timing of the integration of the operations of Greenwich Connecticut and a shift in product mix to a greater proportion of low and medium by pass engines. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1995 increased 94.7% to $13.6 million, or 7.0% of net sales, from $7.0 million, or 6.6% of net sales for fiscal 1994. The increase was primarily due to the addition of marketing and administrative expenses from increased business activity, a full year of Greenwich Connecticut operations, the write off of uncollectible accounts and the higher incentive bonus expense related to the Companys financial performance. Interest expense for fiscal 1995 increased 67.1% to $8.0 million, or 4.0% of net sales, from $4.8 million, or 4.5% of net sales, for fiscal 1994, primarily due to an increase in the Companys average borrowings during the period as a result of increased business activity and the acquisition of Greenwich Connecticut. As a result of the above factors, net income increased 85.3% to $6.2 million, or 3.2% of net sales, for fiscal 1995, from $3.3 million, or 3.2% of net sales, for fiscal 1994. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since the consummation of the Aviall Acquisition, the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the New Credit Facility, the Companys primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Facility. In addition, other sources of liquidity have been advance payments for power station installations and other customer progress payments. Since the Aviall acquisition, and through November 30, 1996, the Company had borrowed aproximately $53.7 million additional under the New Credit Facility in order to restock former Aviall Business inventories to an adequate level, purchase additional inventory and aircraft engines required to service certain customers under new and existing contracts, and to fund expenditures related to the integration of the former Aviall Business with the Companys operations. The Company will be required to borrow additional amounts under the New Credit Facility in the near future in order to fund current asset increases in support of business growth, reduce accounts payable, fund further integration expenses, and satisfy interest payment obligations under the Senior Notes. The Companys liquidity has been affected by the substantial indebtedness the Company has incurred in connection with the financing of the Aviall acquisition, which has substantially increased the Companys cash requirements for debt service and has imposed various operating restrictions. The New Credit Facility and the Indenture under which the Notes were offered contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, make certain investments, transact with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. See "New Credit Facility", below. 17 The Companys aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $1.7 million, $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Prior to the Companys acquisition of the Aviall Business, Aviall had spent in excess of $84.0 million over five years to build state of the art engine repair and overhaul facilities in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas and in Prestwick, Scotland. Management anticipates that the total capital expenditures for fiscal 1997 will be approximately $6.0 million, which will be used to fund the purchase of production tooling and data processing equipment. Management plans to fund these capital expenditures from cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the New Credit Facility. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996, the Companys cash used by operations was $8.2 million; cash used for investing activities was $234.0 million; and cash generated by financing activities was $242.4 million. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operations and plans for integrating the Aviall Business, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the New Credit Facility, will be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements, including scheduled interest and principal payments, integration expenses, capital expenditures and working capital needs. The Companys (i) income from operations (excluding non recurring charges) for the twelve months ended September 30, 1995 and the twelve months ended September 30, 1996 totaled $17.7 million and $31.9 million, respectively and (ii) working capital as of September 30, 1996 was $273.6 million. The Company believes that the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business following the Aviall Acquisition has resulted in opportunities to improve cash flows by capitalizing on the cost savings resulting from the elimination of duplicative functions in the areas of administration, sales, marketing, purchasing, technical and field services and management information systems. However, the Company has incurred expenditures of approximately $2.0 million as of November 30, 1996 related to the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business and expects to incur additional expenditures in the future of approximately $6.5 million related to such integration, which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 1997. Such non recurring expenditures include amounts related to integration of management information systems and other costs of consolidation. These non recurring expenditures have been funded with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Facility. SUMMARY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS NEW CREDIT FACILITY Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition and the related Equity Offering and Senior Note Offering, the Company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness under its existing credit facility through a new loan and security agreement (the "New Credit Facility") with a group of secured lenders (collectively, the "Senior Lenders"). Under the New Credit Facility, which expires in June 2001, the Senior Lenders have provided the Company with two senior secured revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million secured by the Companys accounts receivable, inventories and contract rights. Advances under the New Credit Facility are based upon percentages of outstanding eligible accounts receivable, and inventories. Concurrently with the refinancing under the New Credit Facility, an aggregate of approximately $67.7 million was borrowed primarily to pay down existing revolver debt, finance a portion of the purchase price for the Aviall acquisition, and secure outstanding letters of credit. The New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants (relating to minimum ratios of cash flow to fixed charges, minimum ratio of funded debt to cash flow and minimum tangible net worth) and other covenants, including limitations on additional debt (in excess of the Notes, Debentures and other outstanding debt), dividends and changes in control. Under the New Credit Facility, the Company may elect to borrow at either (i) the lenders prime rate, plus 0.875% (subject to reduction to 0.5% or increase to 1.125% based upon the Companys achieving or failing to achieve certain financial goals), or (ii) the LIBOR rate (adjustable every three months) plus 2.375%. As at November 30, 1996, the lenders prime rate was 8.25% and the two month LIBOR rate was 5.50%, and the Companys available line of credit under the New Credit Facility was approximately $71.9 million. 18 TERM DEBT TERM LOAN. In November 1992, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a commercial lender for a five year, $9.0 million term loan expiring in November 1997 (the "Term Loan"). The Term Loan is secured by certain of the Companys equipment and tooling which, as of September 30,1996, had a net book value of approximately $10.9 million. This loan bears interest at 8.75% per annum, payable in 59 monthly installments (including principal and interest) of $143,205 each, and a final payment of approximately $3.3 million due on November 1, 1997. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the Term Loan was $4.6 million. CONNECTICUT TERM LOAN. On May 26, 1994, the Company and Greenwich Connecticut entered into a separate loan and security agreement with a lender for a five year, $8.0 million term loan expiring in May 1999 (the "Connecticut Term Loan"). The Connecticut Term Loan is secured by substantially all of Greenwich Connecticuts fixed assets (excluding real estate) which, as of September 30, 1996, had a net book value of approximately $16.1 million. This loan bears interest at a rate of 8.99% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. Principal repayments under this agreement are to be made in 24 consecutive monthly installments of $166,667 each and an additional 36 consecutive monthly installments of $111,111 each, with all such payments ending in May 1999. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the Connecticut Term Loan was $3.3 million. LOAN PAYABLE TO WAL. In November 1992, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with WAL for a five year, $3.0 million term loan expiring in November 1997 (the "WAL Loan"). The WAL Loan is co secured by the same equipment and tooling as the Term Loan, and bears interest at 10.25% per annum, payable in 59 monthly installments (including principal and interest) of $50,519 each, and a final payment of approximately $1.1 million due on November 1, 1997. On April 1, 1994, subject to the terms and conditions of the Connecticut Term Loan, WAL agreed to grant a priority lien position to the lender under the Connecticut Term Loan on the Companys tooling and equipment. In return, WAL was granted a priority lien position on specific tooling and a first mortgage on certain real property that the Company owns in East Granby, Connecticut. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the WAL loan was $1.5 million. SENIOR NOTE OFFERING Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition, the Company consummated a public offering (the "Senior Note Offering") of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10 1/2% Senior Notes due 2006 (the "Notes"). The total proceeds to the Company, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, were approximately $154.7 million. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, rank PARI PASSU with all unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are not redeemable prior to June 1, 2001; however, at any time on or after June 1, 2001, the Notes are redeemable at the Option of the Company, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to: (a) 105.25%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2001; (b) 103.50%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2002; (c) 101.75%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2003; and (d) 100%, if redeemed thereafter, beginning June 1, 2004. The Notes are also guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by each of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and are secured on a PARI PASSU basis with the indebtedness under the Companys senior credit facility by a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of Greenwich Caledonian Limited (formerly, Aviall Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Indenture for the Notes, dated as of June 1, 1996, between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Trustee, contains limitations on, among other things, (a) the incurrence of additional Company indebtedness, (b) the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of preferred stock by Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined), (c) the payment of dividends and other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Company and the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock of the Company, (d) the making of certain Investments (as defined), (e) the incurrence of certain Liens (as defined), (f) the issuance and sale of capital stock of, and certain payments by, Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined), (g) transactions with Affiliates (as defined), (h) the designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and (I) consolidations, mergers and transfers of assets. 19 EQUITY OFFERING Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition, the Company consummated a public offering (the "Equity Offering") of 4,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. Of the 4,000,000 Class B shares sold in connection with the Equity Offering, 3,400,000 Class B shares were sold by the Company, and 600,000 Class B Shares were sold by Eugene P. Conese, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (sometimes referred to herein as the "Selling Stockholder"). The total proceeds to the Company and the Selling Stockholder, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, were approximately $80.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively. The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Class B Common Stock by the Selling Stockholder in the Equity Offering. SUBORDINATED DEBT 8% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. In November and December 1993, the Company issued $16,999,000 principal amount of the Debentures. On October 2, 1996, the Company announced that it intended to redeem all of the outstanding Debentures on November 25, 1996, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any unpaid interest accrued to November 25, 1996. Prior to the redemption, all $2.5 million of the then outstanding debentures were converted by the holders thereof, at a conversion price of $5.85 per share, into approximately 428,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock. STOCK DIVIDEND On May 8, 1996 the Company distributed to holders of the Companys Class A Common Stock one share of Class B Common Stock for each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding. The rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical, except that their Class B Common Stock has no voting rights. USE OF PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OFFERING AND SENIOR NOTE OFFERING AND NEW CREDIT FACILITY The net proceeds to the Company from the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the Initial Drawdown, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, totaled approximately $299.9 million. Approximately $230.1 million was utilized to pay the purchase price for the Aviall Business, and approximately $55.3 million was utilized to repay outstanding advances under the Companys existing credit facilities. In addition, approximately $5.6 million was used to pay expenses relating to the Aviall acquisition, the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the New Credit Facility. Such expenses did not, however, include expenses relating to the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business, which are estimated to be approximately $8.5 million. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of" (SFAS N. 121), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. SFAS No. 121 requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123 does not rescind or interpret existing accounting rules for employee stock based arrangements. Under SFAS No. 123, the Company may continue to follow existing rules to recognize and measure compensation, but they will now be required to disclose the pro forma amounts of net income and earnings per share that would have to be reported had the Company elected to follow the "fair value" recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123 will apply to the Company beginning with the year ended September 30, 1997. The Company has not determined whether it will elect to recognize and measure compensation expense under SFAS No. 123 and has not yet determined its effect, if any, on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 20

The following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10 K, together with the above Forward Looking Statements; Factors That May Affect Future Results and aforementioned Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations: The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total net sales that such items represent in the consolidated statements of income. Years ended January 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 65.6 % 64.7 % 63.7 % Gross profit 34.4 % 35.3 % 36.3 % Selling expenses 10.8 % 12.0 % 13.1 % General and administrative expenses 12.8 % 12.7 % 13.1 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses 23.6 % 24.7 % 26.2 % Income from operations 10.8 % 10.6 % 10.1 % Interest expense (.2 %) (.2 %) (.2 %) Other income .2 % .4 % .4 % Income before taxes 10.8 % 10.8 % 10.3 % Provision for taxes 3.5 % 3.7 % 3.4 % Net income 7.3 % 7.1 % 6.9 % FYE 2013 versus FYE 2012: Net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 were $109.9 million compared with $100.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $9.8 million or 9.8%. Sales in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment were $49.1 million, or $5.5 million higher than the $43.6 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of 12.6%. This sales increase in the current fiscal year was driven by higher sales in the (i) Strobic Air business unit, attributable to a $3.5 million order booked in the prior fiscal year and shipped in the current fiscal year and (ii) Met Pro Environmental Air Solutions business units, primarily attributable to the Bio Reaction product line. 19 Index Sales in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment totaled $37.7 million, or $4.4 million higher than the $33.3 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of 13.3%.The fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 benefited from a $6.0 million Fybroc export order that was shipped and invoiced within the fiscal year, as compared to a $3.7 million Fybroc export order that was substantially shipped and invoiced in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. Sales in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment totaled $13.0 million, essentially flat with sales for the year ended January 31, 2012, resulting from a sales increase in our North America and China operations, offset by a sales decrease in our European operation attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange translation compared with the prior year. The industrial markets serviced by this reporting segment are primarily comprised of the automotive and housing industries. Sales in the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment were $10.2 million, or $0.2 million lower than the $10.4 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, a decrease of 1.7%. This decrease was due to lower demand in the Keystone Filter and Pristine Water Solutions businesses compared with the same period last year, as a result of price competition and continued weakness in the markets serviced by these business units. Foreign sales were $30.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, compared with $28.0 million for the same period last year, an increase of $2.6 million or 9.5%. This increase was primarily attributable to a foreign sales increase of 17.0% in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment due to the aforementioned Fybroc export order and a 15.4% increase in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment. Income from operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 was $11.9 million compared with $10.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $1.3 million or 12.1%. Income from operations in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment was $1.0 million, or $0.2 million lower than the $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, a decrease of 13.7%. The decrease in income from operations in this reporting segment was primarily related to three large contracts in the Met Pro Environmental Air Solutions business unit which, although contributing $2.7 million in revenue, were at an aggregate break even gross profit, and higher general and administrative expense. These adverse factors offset the higher gross profit margins in the Strobic Air business unit and Bio Reaction brand compared with the same period last year. Income from operations in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment totaled $10.0 million, or $1.8 million higher than the $8.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of 21.1%. The increase in income from operations resulted from a 13.3% increase in sales, as well as higher gross profit margins within this reporting segment. Income from operations in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment totaled $0.8 million, essentially flat with the comparable fiscal year period. Income from operations in the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment was $0.1 million, or $0.3 million lower than the $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, a decrease of 79.9%.The decrease in income from operations was primarily related to lower gross margins in the Pristine Water Solutions business unit, attributable to competitive pricing pressures in the municipal markets serviced by this business unit. Net income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 was $8.0 million compared with $7.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $0.9 million or 12.8%. Gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 was 34.4% compared with 35.3% for the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin in our Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies and Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segments as well as Filtration/Purification Technologies segment were lower as compared with the same period last year, which offset higher gross profit margins in our Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment as compared with the same period last year. Selling expense was $11.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 compared with $12.0 million for the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $0.2 million. The decrease in selling expense was primarily attributable to lower payroll expense partially offset by increased advertising in the current year period compared to the prior year period. Selling expense as a percentage of net sales was 10.8% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 compared with 12.0% for the same period last year. General and administrative expense was $14.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, compared with $12.8 million in the prior fiscal year, an increase of $1.3 million. This increase was due primarily to: (i) healthcare and pension expenses which were $0.9 million higher in the current year period compared with the same period last year and (ii) costs of approximately $0.7 million related to separation expenses, which included salary continuation, stock option modification and transition expenses, associated with the Companys change in its Chief Financial Officer, compared with $0.3 million of severance expense in the prior year period. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 12.8% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, compared with 12.7% for the prior fiscal year. 20 Index Interest expense was approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012. Other income was $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, compared with $0.4 million in the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $0.2 million. The decrease in other income was primarily attributable to higher gains on foreign currency exchange in the prior year period compared to the current year period. The effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012 were 32.2% and 34.1%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the previous year was primarily the result of a one time benefit attributable to deductible stock compensation expense resulting from a change in the status of outstanding stock options. FYE 2012 versus FYE 2011: Net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 were $100.2 million compared with $88.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of $11.3 million or 12.7%. Sales in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment were $43.6 million, or $2.2 million higher than the $41.4 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 5.2%. The sales increase was due primarily to higher sales for all product brands within the Met Pro Environmental Air Solutions business unit, partially offset by lower sales for our Strobic Air systems that we attribute to, among other factors, elongated delivery schedules of booked orders, delays in the timing of customer orders for large projects and reduced construction in the pharmaceutical, university and other industries that purchase Strobic Airs products. Sales in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment totaled $33.3 million, or $5.8 million higher than the $27.5 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 21.0%. The sales increase was due to higher sales for all product brands within this reporting segment. A large percentage of the $5.8 million increase over the previous year was attributable to the shipment of the $2.4 million balance of a $3.7 million order for Fybroc brand pumps that was announced on October 12, 2010. Sales in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment totaled $12.9 million, or $3.0 million higher than the $9.9 million of sales for the year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 30.8%. The sales increase in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment was due to an increase in sales across all Mefiag product lines which we attribute to an apparent improvement in the industrial markets serviced by this reporting segment which are primarily the automotive and housing industries. Sales in the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment were $10.4 million, or $0.3 million higher than the $10.1 million of sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 3.3%. This increase in sales was due primarily to increased demand in our Keystone Filter business unit partially offset by decreased demand in our Pristine Water Solutions business unit as a result of price competition, inclement weather in certain geographic areas and continued weakness in the municipal markets serviced by this business unit. Foreign sales were $28.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, compared with $22.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of 24.9%. Compared with the prior fiscal year, foreign sales increased 42.1% in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment, 40.8% in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment and 29.1% in the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment, offset by a decrease of 5.3% in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment. Income from operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 was $10.6 million compared with $9.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of $1.6 million or 18.1%. Income from operations in the Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies reporting segment was $1.2 million, or $0.8 million lower than the $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, a decrease of 41.4%. The decrease in income from operations in this reporting segment was primarily related to the following: (i) lower sales for our Strobic Air systems, (ii) lower gross profit margins experienced amongst all product brands within this reporting segment due primarily to product mix, increases in material cost and competitive pricing pressures and (iii) severance expense of approximately $0.3 million recognized in the Companys second quarter ended July 31, 2011 as a result of the Company offering a voluntary employee early retirement program. 21 Index Income from operations in the Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment totaled $8.2 million, or $2.3 million higher than the $5.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 38.7%. The increase in income from operations resulted from a 21.0% increase in sales and higher gross profit margins within this reporting segment. Income from operations in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment totaled $0.8 million, or $0.4 million higher than the $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of 94.3%. The increase in income from operations in the Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segment resulted from a 30.8% increase in sales, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Income from operations in the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment was $0.4 million, or $0.2 million lower than the $0.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, a decrease of 34.3%. The decrease in income from operations was related to decreased sales and lower gross margins in our Pristine Water Solutions business unit. The lower gross margins experienced in our Pristine Water Solutions business unit was due primarily to increases in material cost and competitive pricing pressures. Net income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 was $7.1 million compared with $6.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, an increase of $1.0 million or 16.2%. Gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 was 35.3% compared with 36.3% for the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin in our Product Recovery/Pollution Control Technologies and Mefiag Filtration Technologies reporting segments as well as the Filtration/Purification Technologies segment were lower as compared with the same period last year, partially offset by higher gross profit margins in our Fluid Handling Technologies reporting segment as compared with the same period last year. Selling expense was $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 compared with $11.7 million for the prior fiscal year. The slight increase in selling expense was primarily due to higher payroll expenses, web and print advertising and exhibitions. Selling expense as a percentage of net sales was 12.0% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 compared with 13.1% for the same period last year. General and administrative expense was $12.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, compared with $11.6 million in the prior fiscal year, an increase of $1.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to (i) higher payroll expenses, (ii) severance expense of approximately $0.3 million recognized in the Companys second quarter ended July 31, 2011 as a result of the Company offering a voluntary employee early retirement program and (iii) higher personnel acquisition expenses. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was 12.7% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012, compared with 13.1% for the prior fiscal year. Interest expense was approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011. Other income was $0.4 million for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011. The increase in other income primarily related to a gain on foreign currency exchange. The effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011 were 34.1% and 32.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate of 1.4% from the previous year was due primarily to an increase in stock option tax expense resulting from a reduction in the exercising of non qualified stock options from the previous year, as well as due to a reevaluation of the Companys FASB ASC Topic 740 accrual. Liquidity and Capital Resources: The Companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under existing lines of credit and access to credit markets. The Companys principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, dividends and debt service. Management expects that the Companys current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity will be sufficient to support the Companys planned operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and at least the next twelve months. 22 Index The Companys cash and cash equivalents were $33.3 million on January 31, 2013 compared with $34.6 million on January 31, 2012, a decrease of $1.3 million. The decrease in the Companys cash and cash equivalents is primarily the net result of quarterly cash dividend payments aggregating to $4.2 million, investment in property and equipment of $2.0 million and payments on debt totaling $0.9 million, partially offset by the positive cash flows provided by operating activities of $5.3 million. The Companys cash flows from operating activities are also influenced, in part, by the timing of shipments and negotiated standard payment terms, including retention associated with major projects, as well as other factors including changes in inventories and accounts receivable balances. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 amounted to $5.3 million compared with $9.0 million in the prior year fiscal period, a decrease of $3.7 million. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities, as compared with the same period last year, was due principally to the following: (i) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.4 million compared with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.1 million for the same period last year, or a period to period cash outflow of $4.5 million and (ii) a decrease in customers advances of $1.8 million compared with an increase in customers advances of $2.3 million for the same period last year, or a period to period cash outflow of $4.1 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by the following: (i) a decrease in inventories of $0.1 million compared with an increase in inventories of $2.5 million for the same period last year, or a period to period cash inflow of $2.5 million, (ii) a decrease in accrued pension retirement benefits of $1.3 million compared with a decrease in accrued pension benefits of $2.7 million for the same period last year, or a period to period cash inflow of $1.4 million, (iii) net income increasing by $0.9 million from the same period last year and (iv) an increase in accounts receivable of $1.4 million compared with an increase in accounts receivable of $2.2 million in the same period last year, or a period to period cash inflow of $0.8 million. Cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 amounted to $1.8 million compared with cash flows used in investing activities of $2.6 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $0.8 million. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities is due to proceeds from maturities of investments of $1.3 million compared with proceeds from maturities of investments of $0.5 million for the same period last year, or a period to period cash inflow of $0.8 million. Financing activities during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 utilized $4.8 million of available resources, compared with $4.2 million utilized during the prior year period. The increase in cash utilized amounting to $0.6 million is principally due to increases in payments for dividends and debt, somewhat offset by lower borrowings under the Companys Mefiag B.V. subsidiarys line of credit, compared with the same period last year. The Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.071 per share payable on March 16, 2012, June 15, 2012 and September 14, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2012, June 1, 2012 and August 31, 2012, respectively. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0725 per share payable on December 17, 2012 and March 15, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 3, 2012 and March 1, 2013, respectively. The Company and its subsidiaries have access to $4.4 million of uncommitted, unsecured domestic and foreign lines of credit, subject to terms thereof, of which $0.8 million has been committed for standby letters of credit as of January 31, 2013. The existing domestic credit agreements include two financial covenants: a liability/tangible net worth ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. At January 31, 2013, we were in compliance with both financial covenants. The required liability/tangible net worth ratio, which measures total liabilities to tangible net worth, is a maximum of 1.20 times. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, our liability/tangible net worth ratio using this measure was 0.42 times and 0.52 times, respectively. The required fixed charge coverage ratio, which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility, compared with the aggregate of interest expense, debt service, dividends and capital expenditures, is a ratio of at least 1.05 times. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, our fixed charge coverage ratio using this measure was 1.70 times and 1.54 times, respectively. Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby a default on one debt obligation of the Company in excess of a specified amount, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of January 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all such provisions. As of January 31, 2013, approximately $1.6 million of the Companys cash and cash equivalents were held by certain non U.S. subsidiaries, as well as being denominated in foreign currencies. The repatriation of cash and cash equivalent balances from non U.S. subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, such cash and cash equivalent balances are generally available, without legal restrictions, to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the unremitted earnings of such non U.S. subsidiaries because it is managements intention to reinvest such earnings in non U.S. subsidiaries for the foreseeable future. 23 Index Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity or an increase in liquidity beyond the historical rate of increase. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. The Company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. ASC Topic 715 requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans (the Plans) as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in the funded status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. ASC Topic 715 also requires us to measure the funded status of the Plans as of the year end consolidated balance sheets date. We froze the accrual of future benefits for our salaried and non union hourly employees effective as of December 31, 2006, and for our union hourly employees effective as of December 31, 2008. As of January 31, 2013, our unfunded pension liability was approximately $8.9 million, and we expect to contribute approximately $1.2 million to the pension plans during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. As part of our commitment to the future, the Company expended $2.2 million and $2.5 million on research and development in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company will continue to invest in new product development to maintain and enhance its competitive position in the markets in which we participate. Capital expenditures will be made to support operations and expand our capacity to meet market demands. The Company intends to finance capital expenditures in the coming year through cash flows from operations and will secure third party financing, when deemed appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We have no off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K, that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures that are material to investors. Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes the Companys contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2013 by required payment periods: Total Contractual Payments Due By Long Term Purchase Operating Interest Pension Cash Period Debt Obligations Leases Expense Contributions Obligations Less than 1 Year $ 369,622 $ 7,441,036 $ 110,392 $ 137,132 $ 1,194,591 $ 9,252,773 1 3 Years 739,244 30,464 209,596 2,268,747 3,248,051 3 5 Years 467,684 135,044 566,051 1,168,779 More than 5 Years 759,985 79,799 369,199 1,208,983 Total $ 2,336,535 $ 7,441,036 $ 140,856 $ 561,571 $ 4,398,588 $ 14,878,586 Future expected obligations under the Companys pension plans are included in the contractual cash obligations table above, up to, but not more than five years. The Companys pension plan policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of the pension cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. The Company currently projects that it will contribute $1.2 million to its pension plans during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. 24 Index Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Managements Discussion and Analysis of its Financial Position and Results of Operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes a majority of its revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from contracts related to the Companys subsidiary Bio Reaction Industries Inc., representing the minority of revenues, are recognized on the percentage of completion method, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date, compared with the estimated total contract costs for each contract. This method is used because management considers contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts related to Bio Reaction Industries Inc. Depreciation and Amortization: Property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill: The Company assesses the qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect the fair value of goodwill carried in its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when an indicator of impairment exists. Quantitative impairment testing involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method, we rely on a number of assumptions including sales and related gross margin projections, operating margins, anticipated working capital requirements and market rate of returns used in discounting projected cash flows. These assumptions are based upon market and industry forecasts, our business plans and historical data. Inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors. The discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital available to the Company. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis on each of the Companys reporting units that carry goodwill on their balance sheets. In each case, the fair value exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill, by a significant amount, except for Pristine Water Solutions, which represents 16.1% of the total Company wide goodwill. There was a decline in net sales and operating profit of our Pristine Water Solutions business unit during the current fiscal year, that we attribute to a number of factors including raw material price increases, increased price competition, product mix, continued weaknesses in Pristine Water Solutions principal market, the municipal market, and inclement weather in certain geographic areas which affected product demand. For Pristine Water Solutions, the carrying value as of January 31, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $4.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The fair value of Pristine Water Solutions as of January 31, 2013 and 2012 totaled $6.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively. As a result, the fair value exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill, by $2.0 million and $1.3 million at January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Therefore, as of January 31, 2013, Pristine Water Solutions goodwill was not impaired. Because of market conditions and or potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Based on current projections, a one percent decrease in revenue growth, a one percent decrease in gross margin or a one percent increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value for Pristine Water Solutions by $1.1 million, $0.5 million, and $0.4 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company cannot predict the occurrence of unknown events that might adversely affect the reportable value of goodwill related to Pristine Water Solutions. 25 Index Flex Kleen, which initially performed well after being acquired by Met Pro, thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets. As of January 31, 2012, Flex Kleens fair value exceeded its carrying amount but not by a significant amount. Due to improving performance during the year ended January 31, 2013, Flex Kleens fair value increased and exceeded its carrying amount by a significant amount as of January 31, 2013. This improvement is attributable to general strengthening in the markets served by Flex Kleen. Our impairment models provide that Pristine Water Solutions and Flex Kleens performance needs to continue to improve on an annual basis for a number of fiscal years in order for us not to be potentially required to write off some or all of their goodwill. If in the future we determine that there has been an impairment of Pristine Water Solutions and or Flex Kleens goodwill, we will be required to record a non cash charge to earnings, to the extent of the impairment, during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is determined, which would have an adverse impact upon our results of operations and financial position. We anticipate that Pristine Water Solutions and Flex Kleens performance during the fiscal year beginning February 1, 2013 will be at a level that will not indicate impairment of their goodwill, but this expectation is a forward looking statement where the actual results may not be as we presently anticipate. Pension Obligations: The determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 12 of the January 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Form 10 K and include, among others, the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease in the discount rate by 25 basis points would have had an immaterial impact on net periodic pension expense, but would have increased the projected benefit obligation by $0.9 million. A decrease in the long term rate of return on plan assets by 25 basis points would have increased net periodic pension expense by $0.1 million, but would have had no impact on the projected benefit obligation. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012 02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. This ASU simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which improves consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories. This amended standard permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. For assets in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards. The guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012; early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013 02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" ("ASU 2013 02"), an update to ASC Topic 220 Comprehensive Income. The amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. ASU 2013 02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012. An entity should provide the required disclosures retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard will not impact the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 26 Index Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks: We are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. For Met Pro Corporation, these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates. We do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes. The carrying value of the Companys total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt, at January 31, 2013 was $2.6 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease (increase) in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase (decrease) in the Companys estimated weighted average borrowing rate at January 31, 2013. Although most of the interest on the Companys debt is indexed to either the LIBOR or EURIBOR market rates, there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the Companys total debt for such a hypothetical change. The Company has only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments. The Company has one interest rate swap agreement to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates. Effective April 3, 2006, the Company entered into a fifteen year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the bond payable maturing April 2021. The Company swapped the ninety day LIBOR for a fixed rate of 4.87%. As of January 31, 2013 the effective fixed interest rate was 7.01% as a result of the swap agreement plus the interest rate floor provision of 250 basis points. The interest rate swap agreement is accounted for as a cash flow hedge that qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. There was no hedge ineffectiveness as of January 31, 2013. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement resulted in a decrease in equity of $190,873 (net of tax) and $230,760 (net of tax) at January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These results are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of shareholders equity. See Note 7, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, Canada, the Peoples Republic of China and Chile. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings. Due to the fact that most of our foreign sales are denominated in the local currency, we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. 27 Index
