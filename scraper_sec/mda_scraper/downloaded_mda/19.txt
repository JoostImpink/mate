ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001. Net income was $459,000, or $.11 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to a net loss of $(2,403,000), or $(0.55) per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. A comparison of the changes in major components of net income between the two years is provided below. INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased by $1,096,000, or 69%, from 2001 to 2002. This increase was due to a $1,266,000, or 97%, increase in interest and fees on loans and purchased receivables, a $179,000, or 69%, decrease in interest on cash equivalents, and a $9,000, or 30%, increase in interest on investment securities. The majority of the increase in loan interest occurred at WebBank. In January 2002, WebBank began a new accounts receivable factoring program (the "Factoring Program"). The Factoring Program resulted in an average balance of outstanding purchased receivables of $2,854,000 with an average yield of 45.2% and interest income of $1,345,000. Later in 2002, WebFinancial Corporation also began factoring accounts receivable on a smaller scale, generating interest income of $84,000 for the year. The decrease in interest on cash equivalents and increase in interest on investment securities occurred primarily at WebFinancial Corporation. During 2001, WebFinancial Corporation invested its excess cash exclusively in money market funds. During 2002, WebFinancial Corporation diversified its short term investments into equity securities and factored receivables as described above. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased by $64,000 or 16%, from 2001 to 2002. All of the Companys interest expense was incurred by WebBank during both years. Although WebBanks average deposits increased from $7,305,000 in 2001 to $12,501,000 in 2002, the average interest rate paid on those deposits decreased from 5.17% to 2.68%. This rate decrease was primarily a result of general interest rate movements and not from a shortening of deposit maturities. For example, the six month Treasury Bill rate averaged 3.38% in 2001 and decreased to an average of 1.69% in 2002. PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES. The credit loss provision decreased from $1,682,000 in 2001 to $(60,000) in 2002. A significant portion of the WebBank USDA B&I loan portfolio experienced difficulty during 2001. Nonaccruing loans totaled $2,027,000 at the end of 2001. Aggressive action was taken during both years to reduce the level of nonaccruing and other problem loans, and, by the end of 2002, nonaccruing loans decreased by nearly 50% to $1,171,000. The significant reductions of non accruing loans and the partial and full paydowns of other loans resulted in unallocated credit loss reserves for the USDA B&I portfolio at December 31, 2002. Consequently, a $60,000 credit loss credit was generated in 2002. 6 NONINTEREST INCOME. Noninterest income increased from $1,126,000 in 2001 to $1,161,000 in 2002, a change of $35,000, or 3%. Several of WebBanks fee for service customers discontinued their relationship with WebBank in early 2001, but were replaced by new customers during the remainder of 2001 and 2002. NONINTEREST EXPENSES. Noninterest expense decreased from $3,167,000 in 2001 to $3,096,000 in 2002, a reduction of $71,000, or 2%. Salaries, wages, and benefits at WebBank decreased by $156,000, or 14%, between the years due to staff reductions. Additionally, WebBank was not required to amortize goodwill in 2002 under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of $118,000 from 2001 to 2002. Professional fees decreased by $96,000 for the Company in 2002 primarily because of lower collection costs for problem loans at WebBank. These decreases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by servicing costs for the Factoring Program, which was started in 2002. INCOME TAXES. Income taxes of $(10,000) and $11,000 were recorded in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The difference between the expected tax benefit and actual tax benefit is primarily attributable to the effect of the net operating losses, offset by an increase in the Companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. The net loss was $(2,403,000), or $(0.55) per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to a net loss of $(57,000), or $(0.01) per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2000. A comparison of the changes in major components of net income between the two years is provided below. INTEREST INCOME. Interest income decreased by $575,000, or 27%. This decrease was due to a $174,000, or 12%, decrease in interest and fees on loans, a $209,000, or 45%, decrease in interest on cash equivalents, and a $192,000, or 86%, decrease in interest on investment securities. The majority of the decrease in loan interest occurred at WebBank. Although WebBanks average gross loan balance grew from $11,016,000 in 2000 to $11,672,000 in 2001, the annual average national prime rate fell from 9.2% to 7.0% during the same periods. In addition, the Banks average nonaccruing loans increased from $0 in 2000 to $2,121,000 in 2001. The decreases in interest on cash equivalents and investment securities also occurred primarily at WebBank. During 2000, WebBank allowed certain certificates of deposit to mature without replacement. Specifically, certain certificates of deposit were acquired in 1999 in anticipation of loan demand that did not materialize. The funds from these certificates of deposit were invested in securities and cash equivalents during much of 2000. During 2001, funds were acquired as needed to meet actual loan demand, resulting in reduced balances of marketable securities and cash equivalents in 2001 versus 2000. INTEREST EXPENSES. Interest expense decreased by $431,000, or 52%, from 2000 to 2001. The majority of the Companys interest expense decrease occurred at WebBank. As described above, average certificate of deposit balances decreased from $12,104,000 in 2000 to $7,118,000 in 2001. The average annual interest rate paid on certificates of deposit decreased from 6.8% in 2000 to 5.3% in 2001. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. The loan loss provision increased from $917,000 in 2000 to $1,682,000 in 2001. A significant portion of the WebBank USDA B&I loan portfolio experienced difficulty during 2001. Nonaccruing loans increased from $1,514,000 at the end of 2000 to $2,027,000 at the end of 2001. Aggressive action was taken during 2001 to collect problem loans. These actions resulted in an increase in loan charge offs from $312,000 in 2000 to $787,000 in 2001 and an increase in foreclosed assets from $0 in 2000 to $449,000 in 2001. NONINTEREST INCOME. Noninterest income decreased from $3,395,000 in 2000 to $1,126,000 in 2001, a change of $2,269,000 or 67%. Approximately $842,000 of the difference was due to discontinuance of the origination of USDA B&I loans by WebBank in early 2001. Another $987,000 of the decrease was due to the discontinuance or significant reductions during 2001 of the Banks fee for service programs including payday advances, private label credit cards, and structured settlements. 7 NONINTEREST EXPENSE. Noninterest expense decreased from $3,871,000 in 2000 to $3,167,000 in 2001, a change of $704,000, or 18%. The primary reason noninterest expense decreased between the years was the reduction in salaries, wages, benefits, and bonuses at WebBank. In August 2001, WebBank reduced its staff from 10 to 7 employees. INCOME TAXES. Income taxes of $11,000 and $0 were expensed in 2001 and 2000, respectively, because of the use of net operating loss carryforwards. The difference between the expected tax benefit and actual tax benefit is primarily attributable to the effect of the net operating losses, offset by an increase in the Companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys cash and cash equivalents totaled $6,546,000 at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1,451,000 from the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily due to anticipated volume increases in the Factoring Program. The Companys management believes that the Companys cash and cash equivalents as well as its anticipated cash flow projections for 2003 are adequate to meet its near term liquidity requirements. The Company is continuing to seek acquisitions and or merger transactions, as well as product line extensions and or expansions ("New Business"). No firm commitments have been realized and no letters of intent have been signed at this time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate or purchase a New Business, or that such New Business, if acquired, will be profitable. In order to finance an acquisition of a New Business, the Company may be required to incur or assume indebtedness and or issue securities. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections". The most significant provisions of SFAS No. 145 address the termination of extraordinary item treatment for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 with no material impact on its financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal of facilities, and must be implemented not later than December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 with no material impact on its financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions". This Statement amends SFAS No. 72, SFAS No. 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9. Among other topics, this Statement requires that an unidentifiable intangible asset that is recognized in an acquisition of a financial institution, which is accounted for as a business combination, in which the liabilities assumed exceed the identifiable assets acquired, be recorded as goodwill. Consequently, this unidentifiable intangible asset will be subject to the goodwill accounting standards set forth in SFAS No. 142 and will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis instead of being amortized. The Company adopted SFAS No. 147 with no material impact on its financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure". SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share. SFAS No. 148 does not require companies to expense employee stock options. The expanded annual disclosure requirements and the transition provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company anticipates adopting SFAS No. 148 with no material impact on its financial condition or results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS ANNUAL 8 REPORT ON FORM 10 K AND PRESENTED ELSEWHERE BY MANAGEMENT. ALL FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS DOCUMENT ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON THE DATE HEREOF, AND THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES EXIST THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ATTRACT DEPOSITS, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS. BECAUSE OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE FUTURE RESULTS AND SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN RESPONSE TO QUARTERLY VARIATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. RISK FACTORS The following paragraphs discuss certain factors that may affect the Companys financial condition and operations and should be considered in evaluating the Company. INTEREST RATES. The Companys earnings are impacted by changing interest rates. Changes in interest rates impact the level of loans, deposits and investments, the credit profile of existing loans, the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings. Significant fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MONETARY POLICY. The banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation. Significant new laws or changes in existing laws, or repeals of existing laws may cause the Companys results to change materially. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects credit conditions for the Company and a material change in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. COMPETITION. The banking and financial services businesses in the Companys lines of business are highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. The results of the Company may change if circumstances affecting the nature or level of competition change. CREDIT QUALITY. A source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. The Company has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses, that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying the Companys credit portfolio. These policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results. OFF BALANCE SHEET RISK. WebBank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk. In the normal course of business, these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit. Those instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. For further information with respect to off balance sheet risks, please see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NON BANKING ACTIVITIES. The Company may expand its operations into new non banking activities in 2003. Although the Company has experience in providing bank related services, this expertise may not assist in expansion into non banking activities. As a result, the Company may be exposed to risks associated with, among other things, (1) a lack of market and product knowledge or awareness of other industry related matters and (2) an inability to attract and retain qualified employees with experience in these non banking activities. WINOKUR LITIGATION. As described in "Legal Proceedings," a panel of three retired judges (the "Panel") has ruled that Andrew Winokur is entitled to the termination pay out provision of his employment agreement. Under this provision, Mr. Winokur could potentially be entitled to receive certain compensation based on the proceeds of the sale of WebBank if the Company rejects an investment bank valuation of WebBank. While Mr. Winokur would not be entitled to receive any compensation in the event that the sale does not exceed a predetermined amount as provided in the employment agreement, the Company may be forced to sell WebBank if the sale price exceeds the predetermined amount in the employment contract even if the Company does not want to sell WebBank. In addition, if the sale price of WebBank exceeds the predetermined amount but is less than the investment bank valuation of WebBank, the Company may be required to sell WebBank at less than its value. 9 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK MARKET RISK AND ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates. The Companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities and other investment activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure. In connection with the Companys lending and deposit activities, its profitability may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the Companys earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. The Company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools. The primary measure of the Companys exposures to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is an interest rate stress test. This test measures the impact on net interest income of an immediate change in interest rates of plus or minus 3%, in 1% increments. Upon review of the Companys current and projected earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, management believes that in the event of a hypothetical one percent increase or decrease in interest rates, the resulting effect on the Companys net interest income would not be material. The Companys primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the Companys net interest income and capital, while structuring the Companys asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure. The Company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk. In connection with the consolidated Companys other investments, the primary objective is to manage the investment portfolio to preserve principal, maintain liquidity to meet operating needs, and maximize yields. The securities held in the investment portfolio are subject to limited interest rate risk. The Company employs established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company places its investments with high quality issuers, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, and does not use derivative financial instruments in the investment portfolio. The Company maintains an investment portfolio of various issuers, types, and maturities, which consist mainly of equities and fixed rate financial instruments. These securities are primarily classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity. At any time, sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings. Currently, the Company does not hedge these interest rate exposures. After a review of its marketable securities, the Company believes that in the event of a hypothetical one percent increase or decrease in interest rates, the resulting fluctuation in the fair market value of its marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements.
