Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report. Overview We are a leading voice, data and network communications provider servicing business and residential customers primarily in the upper Midwest. We have an expanded, regional fiber network spanning 4,200 route miles serving Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Across this region we provide business customers with IP based voice, data and network solutions, managed services, network integration and support services. We also specialize in unified communication solutions for businesses of all sizes by providing Cisco equipment solutions and support. We offer a wide range of communications services to our residential customers, including voice services, high speed Internet, digital TV and data services. We report our operations in three reportable segments: (1) Fiber and Data (2) Equipment and (3) Telecom. A complete overview of the operations of each reportable segment is included in Item 1. Business beginning on page 3. Executive Summary Highlights in 2013: We made progress with our strategy to grow revenue within our business and broadband services (all revenue from our Fiber and Data Segment and Equipment Segment and a portion of our Telecom Segment revenue). In 2013, 79% of our total consolidated revenue was from business and broadband services compared to 76% in 2012 and 70% in 2011. Consolidated revenue increased $6,004,000 or 3% compared to 2012 due to growth in both the wholesale and business channel revenue in our Fiber and Data Segment and growth in our Equipment Segment, partially offset by a modest decline in our Telecom Segment. EBITDA of $46,959,000 in 2013 increased 2% compared to 2012. Management believes this is an important financial measure as it represents our ability to generate cash flow and is used internally in evaluating our performance. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA can be found in the non GAAP measures section. EBITDA growth in our business segments is offsetting the decline in our traditional telecom EBITDA. Net income of $7,732,000 declined 7% compared to 2012. We completed our $21.1 million multi year construction of a middle mile fiber network as part of our Greater Minnesota Broadband Collaboration Project under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program ("BTOP") of the National Telecommunications Information Administration ("NTIA") of which $14.8M was reimbursed over the three year grant period. We launched a unified brand as Enventis across our entire service area. Business Trends The following discussion highlights key trends management believes are affecting our business. Business and wholesale services. We expect demand for advanced business communications services to continue to grow. We will focus on delivering integrated voice and data services including high capacity Ethernet, MPLS and other fiber based services as well as expanding our Managed and Hosted cloud services. We believe the demands of commercial and enterprise sized businesses will continue to evolve allowing them to keep connected with cost effective, flexible and scalable communication solutions. We are focused on offering competitive products and services to meet their business needs. We foresee business customers shifting from traditional technology and services to VoIP and or cloud based services. Cloud based service offerings will be an area of focus in the future providing our customers a dynamic solution taking advantage of more efficient and flexible technology environments in a cost effective manner. Continued success will hinge on our ability to offer attractive bundles combining our hosted VoIP service with Internet and data service, local or long distance. Our Singlelink Unified Communications product is a hosted service offering customers a single, centrally managed VoIP communications solution. We are focused on selling to customers in targeted geographical markets. 28 Table of Contents Demand for our fiber based transport and access services continues. Revenue in the Fiber and Data Segment is growing despite industry consolidation, technological migration, customer network optimization and price compression. Our fiber based and access services provide support to wireless carriers who continue to see growth in data consumption requiring the need for increased bandwidth. In the past few years, our network has undergone significant enhancements and expansion through capital investments. We expanded our fiber network to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Fargo, North Dakota, increased our capacity in the Des Moines, Iowa market and gained immediate access to the Fargo, North Dakota market with the acquisition of IdeaOne. Our Greater Minnesota Broadband Collaborative project extended our network to enable us to provide high capacity broadband services to rural communities and connect health care facilities, libraries, higher education institutions and public offices, and provided us alternate paths to Duluth, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota. More recently, we focused on last mile fiber builds expanding our reach directly to customers and wireless carrier networks. Legacy services. Revenue associated with our legacy services is anticipated to be adversely impacted by an expected decline in access lines due to intense competition and product substitution as customers opt for alternative technologies such as wireless, VoIP and cable. To help mitigate this trend, we will continue to focus on providing the customer with exceptional service along with offering competitive multi service bundles with term discounts and the ability for customers to customize their package including digital TV, high speed Internet, voice services and features. We remain committed to managing costs as we expect continued declines in the Telecom Segment net profitability. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiber and Data Segment The following table provides detail of the Fiber and Data Segment operating results. For Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2013 % Change 2012 % Change 2011 Operating revenue before intersegment eliminations: Business $ 36,770 15 % $ 31,847 71 % $ 18,657 Wholesale 30,256 7 % 28,262 7 % 26,492 Intersegment 869 5 % 831 8 % 773 Total operating revenue 67,895 11 % 60,940 33 % 45,922 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) 34,343 15 % 29,827 27 % 23,420 Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,196 16 % 11,389 30 % 8,762 Asset impairment 638 100 % 0 % Depreciation and amortization 11,992 21 % 9,923 55 % 6,394 Total costs and expenses 60,169 18 % 51,139 33 % 38,576 Operating income $ 7,726 21 % $ 9,801 33 % $ 7,346 Net income $ 4,700 21 % $ 5,933 34 % $ 4,423 Capital expenditures (A) $ 15,662 21 % $ 19,812 71 % $ 11,553 (A) Net of Broadband Stimulus funds received and does not include changes in materials and supplies. The financial results of this segment reflect IdeaOne Telecoms operations beginning on March 1, 2012. Revenue During the year, we modified the presentation of our Fiber and Data revenue to provide additional detail on our Business and Wholesale revenue streams, as shown in the following tables: Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2013 September 30, 2013 June 30, 2013 March 31, 2013 Operating revenue before intersegment eliminations: Business $ 9,408 $ 9,298 $ 9,239 $ 8,825 Wholesale 7,632 7,438 7,540 7,646 Intersegment 221 222 213 213 Total operating revenue $ 17,261 $ 16,958 $ 16,992 $ 16,684 30 Table of Contents Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2012 September 30, 2012 June 30, 2012 March 31, 2012 Operating revenue before intersegment eliminations: Business $ 8,807 $ 8,532 $ 8,224 $ 6,284 Wholesale 7,378 6,996 6,953 6,935 Intersegment 230 215 193 193 Total operating revenue $ 16,415 $ 15,743 $ 15,370 $ 13,412 Fiber and Data. Fiber and Data Segment revenue streams are generally based on a monthly recurring revenue base, which to a large extent, includes multi year contracts. Business. We serve enterprise and commercial business customers with advanced data services such as Ethernet, Private Line, MPLS, Dedicated Internet, voice and VoIP services. We develop data and Internet solutions to meet the needs of our customers. Business revenue increased $4,923,000 or 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. We remain focused on providing business solutions to meet our customers voice and data needs. Growth in these customer services is driven by sales of data services including Ethernet, MPLS, Dedicated Internet, Private Line and VoIP services along with continued success in the Fargo, North Dakota market following our IdeaOne acquisition. We face intense competition for business customers in the markets we serve and experience customer loss and revenue erosion as contract terms expire and customers seek low cost alternatives. Nonetheless we were able to offset lost revenue associated with customer attrition and price compression by offering a comprehensive array of services such as those described above through our veteran sales staff using a value based selling approach. Wholesale. We provide fiber and data services to regional and national service providers including wireless carriers, telecom providers and other service providers. We provide fiber based transport and access services through our extensive regional fiber network and community access rings, supported by a 24x7x365 Network Operations Center. Our services can be extended beyond our regional network through agreements and interconnections with other carriers for end to end national connectivity. Our expertise allows us to deliver custom network solutions and leverage our capabilities to provide a high bandwidth, self healing platform to provide reliable service. Wholesale revenue increased $1,994,000 or 7% in 2013 compared to 2012. With multi media content and applications becoming a larger part of the wireless traffic, bandwidth demands are rapidly rising to support current and future traffic growth. Wireless carriers require a higher bandwidth connection such as Ethernet, DWDM and MPLS technologies which is driving the revenue growth in wholesale services. Conversely these services continue to be hampered by industry consolidation, technological changes, customer network optimization and price compression, challenging our ability to grow this revenue stream. The number of fiber served cell sites we service increased 33 sites from 56 to 89 sites at December 31, 2013. We anticipate continued growth in this area by building to additional cell sites and by upgrading bandwidth and services on existing towers which will be tempered by customer network optimization and price compression. Cost of Services (excluding Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of services increased $4,516,000 or 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. The main contributors include: An increase of $1,412,000 in wages and benefits reflecting our commitment to support the growth and activity in this segment. An increase of $777,000 in circuit related expenses to support the increase in revenue. An increase of $345,000 in materials expense related to the sale of our VoIP product. An increase of $306,000 in lease and power expense primarily related to additional data center space. An increase of $231,000 in contract labor due to higher usage of contractors for fiber locates and network projects. 31 Table of Contents An increase of $268,000 in maintenance contracts related to deployment of customer premise equipment and new infrastructure. An increase of $183,000 in access expense primarily related to overall growth in long distance. An increase of $163,000 in expense related to our construction materials and supplies. A net increase of $831,000 in other expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses We have invested in our business to support our growth initiatives and service our customers. We remain committed to scaling the business and process improvement. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,807,000 or 16% in 2013 compared to 2012. Expenses to note include: An increase of $878,000 in corporate expense as more of our resources and attention are focused on the efficiencies, success and growth of this segment. Corporate expense in the Equipment and Telecom Segments decreased as an offset result. An increase of $324,000 in wages and benefits. An increase of $429,000 in commission expense related to the increase in revenue. An increase of $102,000 in computer expense related to IT and computer support. An increase of $102,000 in rent expense. A net decrease of $28,000 in other expenses. Asset Impairment We recognized an asset impairment of $633,000 in the first quarter of 2013 related to assets supporting a service we elected to discontinue. Minor adjustments to fully recognize the impairment on all related assets resulted in adding $5,000 in the second quarter to bring the final year to date impairment recognition to $638,000. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2,069,000 or 21% in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase is primarily due to increased capital expenditures supporting our success based initiatives, and expansion and enhancements to our network to increase our capacity and reliability in the markets we serve. 32 Table of Contents Equipment Segment The following table provides detail of the Equipment Segment operating results. For Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2013 % Change 2012 % Change 2011 Operating revenue before intersegment eliminations: Equipment $ 51,465 1 % $ 52,219 31 % $ 39,816 Services 10,218 29 % 7,914 13 % 9,116 Total operating revenue 61,683 3 % 60,133 23 % 48,932 Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) 45,016 0 % 45,054 32 % 34,163 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) 7,155 7 % 6,704 1 % 6,759 Selling, general and administrative expenses 5,672 2 % 5,568 12 % 4,962 Depreciation and amortization 477 59 % 300 1 % 302 Total costs and expenses 58,320 1 % 57,626 25 % 46,186 Operating income $ 3,363 34 % $ 2,507 9 % $ 2,746 Net income $ 2,058 35 % $ 1,523 8 % $ 1,651 Capital expenditures $ 992 173 % $ 364 15 % $ 428 Revenue Equipment. We are a Master Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco distributor providing equipment solutions and support for a broad spectrum of business customers. As an equipment integrator, we design and implement networks utilizing emerging technological advancements including TelePresence Video, Unified Communications and Data Center solutions. We also utilize relationships with other industry leading vendors to provide integrated communication solutions for our clients to meet their emerging networking needs. Equipment sales are non recurring in nature making this revenue dependent upon attracting new sales from existing and new customers, as well as leveraging relationships with our current customer base by adding more value through enhanced product and service offerings. Equipment hardware revenue declined $754,000 or 1% in 2013 compared to 2012. This revenue stream is dependent upon timing, size and volume of customer orders. Although we experienced a decline year over year, customers continue to invest in technology and IT solutions such as unified communication products, data center products, cloud computing solutions, storage, data analysis and IT virtualization. Services. We provide a comprehensive set of services to support equipment solutions, including Advisory, Implementation, Development and Support Services. We have the expertise and experience to transform the available technology into solutions to solve business challenges and meet their objectives. Maintenance contracts ("Smartnet" contracts) are offered in collaboration with Cisco systems. Our Total Care support team provides a proactive approach to monitoring and supporting customer networks, unified communications environments and data centers as well as a single point of contact for the support of applications, systems and infrastructure. Equipment services revenue increased $2,304,000 or 29% in 2013 compared to 2012. This growth is consistent with our plan to maximize this higher margin service revenue. Approximately 88% of the increase is primarily attributable to contract services and support fees revenue due an initiative focusing our customer conversations on service offerings and increased activity performed for a large enterprise customer. The remainder of the increase is related to an increase in maintenance revenue. Maintenance revenue is largely tied to equipment installations, and contracts are typically three to five years. This revenue stream is cyclical in nature and is subject to timing of projects and renewal opportunities. Our strategy is to focus on selling professional and support services with our equipment solutions, leveraging our resources and allowing our clients to focus on their business initiatives limiting their risk in supporting business applications. 33 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales is composed of equipment material costs and is directly related to equipment sales. Decreased equipment sales volume in 2013 drove a similar level of expense in cost of sales compared to 2012. Labor associated with installation of equipment is included in cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) described below. Cost of Services (excluding Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of services increased $451,000 or 7% in 2013 compared to 2012. The change can be attributed to: An increase of $387,000 in wages and benefits due to additional headcount, partially offset by an $80,000 decline in contract labor due to improved employee utilization. A net increase of $144,000 in other expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104,000 or 2% in 2013 compared to 2012. The list below highlights the primary factors for the increase: An increase of $529,000 in employee related costs including wages, benefits, commissions, incentive compensation and employee training. A decrease of $297,000 in corporate expense which is based on resource allocation. A net decrease of $128,000 in other expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense increased $177,000 or 59% in 2013 compared to 2012 driven by the expansion of office space at our Plymouth, Minnesota location. 34 Table of Contents Telecom Segment The following table provides detail for the Telecom Segment operating results. For Year Ended December 31 (Dollars in thousands) 2013 % Change 2012 % Change 2011 Operating revenue Local service $ 11,464 12 % $ 12,955 10 % $ 14,363 Network access 17,800 7 % 19,160 15 % 22,489 Broadband 20,773 5 % 19,748 3 % 20,371 Other 6,273 7 % 6,769 15 % 7,920 Intersegment 1,636 13 % 1,454 2 % 1,427 Total Telecom operating revenue $ 57,946 4 % $ 60,086 10 % $ 66,570 Total Telecom revenue before intersegment eliminations: Unaffiliated customers $ 56,310 $ 58,632 $ 65,143 Intersegment 1,636 1,454 1,427 57,946 60,086 66,570 Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) 26,983 3 % 27,819 9 % 30,581 Selling, general and administrative expenses 8,593 8 % 9,329 12 % 10,575 Depreciation and amortization 14,852 2 % 15,150 0 % 15,164 Total Telecom costs and expenses 50,428 4 % 52,298 7 % 56,320 Operating income $ 7,518 3 % $ 7,788 24 % $ 10,250 Net income $ 4,603 3 % $ 4,743 23 % $ 6,176 Capital expenditures (A) $ 9,782 29 % $ 7,560 12 % $ 8,554 Key metrics Business access lines 19,099 6 % 20,251 13 % 23,316 Residential access lines 20,620 7 % 22,145 9 % 24,386 Total access lines 39,719 6 % 42,396 11 % 47,702 High speed Internet ("DSL") customers 20,983 5 % 19,985 2 % 19,531 Digital TV customers 11,671 10 % 10,640 3 % 10,374 (A) Does not include changes in materials and supplies. Revenue Local Service. We receive recurring revenue for local residential and business voice services, enhanced calling features and miscellaneous local services. We also receive reciprocal compensation revenue based on interconnection agreements with wireless carriers who use our network to terminate calls. Local service revenue declined $1,491,000 or 12% in 2013 compared to 2012. Similar to other communication companies, we have been subject to industry wide access line declines and price compression driven by intense competition and alternative communication options; we experienced a 6% access line decline. We also continue to be impacted by FCC Order 11 161, issued in November 2011, which reforms core parts of the Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation negatively impacting local service revenue as well as network access revenue. The Order mandated elimination of reciprocal compensation from wireless carriers contributing approximately 20% of the annual decline. Business customers continue to shift from traditional voice services to VoIP products and services which are offered by our Fiber and Data Segment and competitors. To mitigate the expected local service revenue decline we remain focused on customer retention by providing exceptional service and continuing to lead with our competitive service bundles. It is expected this will offset some, not all, of the Telecom Segment local service declines. Network Access. We provide access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long distance calls on our network. We also bill subscriber line charges to our customers for access to the public switched network. Network access revenue is derived from several federally administered pooling arrangements designed to provide support and distribute funding to Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILEC"). 35 Table of Contents Network access revenue declined $1,360,000 or 7% in 2013 compared to 2012. The decline is attributable to declines in our access lines and minutes of use on our network driven by competition and network grooming/optimization by the carriers. This revenue stream was, and will continue to be, impacted by regulatory decisions; particularly FCC Order 11 161 that established a framework for the reform of the Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation. Provisions in FCC Order 11 161 call for reductions of interstate and intrastate access charges through gradual annual reductions in rates for certain access components. However, the introduction of the Connect America Fund ("CAF") and increased charges to end user subscribers has helped to mitigate this revenue stream decline. Broadband. We provide residential and business broadband services for monthly recurring revenue. Broadband services include high speed Internet, digital TV services, and business Ethernet and data services. Broadband revenue increased $1,025,000 or 5% in 2013 compared to 2012. The revenue growth is reflective of the success we have experienced in marketing our multi service bundles which helped drive the 10% and 5% growth in our digital TV and high speed Internet ("DSL") customer base, respectively, and the restructuring of our high speed Internet services. We strive to provide the best service experiences for our customers. We are focused on delivering reliable and competitive broadband services and continue to invest in our broadband network. We lead with competitive and flexible multi service bundles which provide pricing discounts and incentives when bundling digital TV, Internet and or voice services. Additional savings are given if a customer opts into a six month, one or two year agreement. In July of 2012, we offered our updated service bundles and as of December 31, 2013 have more than 11,500 bundle subscribers consisting of both new and existing customers; with approximately 95% opting into a two year agreement. We believe the bundles positively impact our customer retention. Other Services Revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of long distance, directory publishing, sales of wholesale contract services, late fees applied to subscriber billings, and add/move/change revenue on customer premise equipment. Other revenue declined $496,000 or 7% in 2013 when compared to 2012. The decline is primarily due to lower directory revenue as businesses migrate away from traditional printed directories to online media platforms and long distance revenue resulting from a declining customer base and lower billable minutes. It is expected there will be continued declines in other revenue partially due to the industry wide trend of access line declines. Cost of Services (excluding Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of services (excluding depreciation and amortization) declined $836,000 or 3% in 2013 compared to 2012. The main contributors include: A decline of $1,152,000 in wages and benefits resulting from a smaller workforce and savings in post retirement benefits due to a plan amendment. A decline of $419,000 in access expense which is a result of lower long distance revenue and a declining customer base. A decline of $171,000 in directory expense in direct correlation to the downward trend of directory revenue. A decline of $122,000 in maintenance contracts. A decline of $109,000 in bad debt expense as a result of higher customer retention associated with our bundles. A decline of $105,000 in reciprocal compensation which is related to the declining revenue as a result of FCC Order 11 161. A net decline of $149,000 in other expenses. An increase of $582,000 in programming costs related to providing our digital TV service attributed to growth in our digital TV subscriber base and subscriber fees. We anticipate additional future increases in programming costs. An increase of $411,000 in circuit expenses associated with providing service to our customers beyond the reach of our network. An increase of $213,000 on losses attributable to asset disposals related to our digital TV and Internet services. An increase of $185,000 in equipment repair and maintenance associated with customer equipment repair. 36 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $736,000 or 8% in 2013 compared to 2012 driven primarily by: A decrease of $334,000 in employee related costs due to a reduction in our workforce and savings in post retirement benefits due to a plan amendment. A decrease of $311,000 in regulatory fees related to the restructuring of our high speed Internet. A net decrease of $91,000 in other expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $298,000 or 2% in 2013 compared to 2012. Although we anticipate future declines in profitability in this segment, we continue to selectively invest in our broadband network, other revenue generating projects and maintenance spend. Corporate and Other Consolidated Results Corporate and Other Operating Income Bill Processing. We provide data processing and billing services to other communication service providers. We collect a combination of monthly recurring revenue, software license fees and integration services revenue from companies with whom we have established long term data processing relationships. Bill processing revenue declined $141,000 or 3% in 2013 compared to 2012. This revenue stream is dependent upon the timing of performance on contract services including project integration services and license fees related to the sale of our SuiteSolution product. Bill processing revenue is also impacted as resources shift to internal projects in an effort to streamline and improve our processes. Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense decreased $1,130,000 or 20% in 2013 following a decrease of $526,000 or 8% in 2012, compared to the respective prior year. Our 2013 year end debt balance (current and long term) of $135,207,000 decreased $1,574,000 from 2012 through mandatory quarterly payments. In 2012, the debt balance increased $16,546,000 from 2011 associated with debt obtained for the IdeaOne acquisition. Effective interest rates were 3.4%, 4.2% and 4.1% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect similar levels of interest expense in 2014 as reported in 2013. During 2013, the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are primarily recorded as a component of equity due to designation of the derivatives as cash flow hedges as of January 1, 2013. In 2012 and 2011, the changes in the fair value of the swap agreements were recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $5,286,000 which is a decrease of $97,000 or 2% compared to 2012. The effective tax rate was 40.6%, 39.3% and 37.5% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2011 was impacted by the release of income tax reserves and associated interest of $406,000, respectively. The effective tax rate would have been 40.5% in 2011 without the release of the income tax reserves and associated interest. Inflation It is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating revenue and expenses over the past three years have been immaterial. Management anticipates this trend will continue in the near future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $12,893,000 as of December 31, 2013 compared to working capital of $9,186,000 as of December 31, 2012. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.4 and 1.3 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Capital Structure The total capital structure (long term and current maturities of long term debt obligations plus shareholders equity) of HickoryTech was $184,517,000 at December 31, 2013, reflecting 27% equity and 73% debt. This compares to a capital structure of $185,629,000 at December 31, 2012, reflecting 26% equity and 74% debt. In the communications industry, debt financing is most often based on multiples of operating cash flows. Specifically, our current use of the senior credit facility is in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 times debt to EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement; well within acceptable limits for our agreement and our industry. We employ an extended term payable financing arrangement for the equipment provisioning portion of our Equipment Segment and view this arrangement as a structured accounts payable that is paid within 60 days with no separate interest charge. As such, the extended term payable financing amount of $8,879,000 and $8,115,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is not considered to be part of our capital structure and has been excluded from the above amounts (see Note 8 "Extended Term Payable"). In 2013, our primary source of liquidity was from operations. In 2013, we did not change our equity capitalization and equity was not a new source of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents of $7,960,000 at December 31, 2013 decreased $345,000, as compared to $8,305,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012. Our cash balance is a product of timing of our capital expenditures and working capital needs. In 2013, we repurchased $1,275,000 of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase plan. Cash Flows Management expects to have the ability to meet current and long term liquidity and capital requirements through operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our credit facility. For temporary increases in cash demand we use our cash inflow and for more significant fluctuations in liquidity caused by growth initiatives we utilize our senior credit facility. These sources coupled with our access to a $30,000,000 revolving credit facility (presently unused) provide further assurance against interruption in our business plans due to financing. Our expected primary uses of cash include ongoing operating requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility, temporary financing of trade accounts receivable and the payment of dividends, as they are declared. While it is difficult for us to predict the impact economic conditions may have on our business, we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term cash requirements primarily through our operating cash flows. We are in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2013 and anticipate that we will be able to plan for and match future liquidity needs with future internal and available external resources. Our senior credit facility will be the sole external source of financing for the foreseeable future. We feel we can adjust the timing and or the number of strategic and growth initiatives according to any limitation which may be imposed by our capital structure or sources of financing. We do not anticipate our capital structure will limit growth initiatives over the next 12 months. (Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 35,924 $ 41,937 $ 42,343 Investing activities (27,087 ) (55,715 ) (21,956 ) Financing activities (9,182 ) 9,026 (7,403 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (345 ) $ (4,752 ) $ 12,984 Cash generated from operations represents the amount of cash generated by our operations after the payment of operating obligations. This continues to be our primary source of funds. Cash generated from operations was primarily attributable to net income plus non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization. Cash generated from operations during 2013 decreased $6,013,000 compared to 2012, which was primarily due to normal fluctuations in our working capital balances. These fluctuations are often driven by the timing and volume of customer orders within our Equipment Segment. 38 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities was down $28,628,000 compared to 2012. The acquisition of IdeaOne Telecom in 2012 for an adjusted purchase price of $26,337,000 accounts for 92% of the change. Capital expenditures decreased 8% when comparing 2013 to 2012 after adjusting for the $1,856,000 received in 2013 and the $5,745,000 received in 2012 from the NTIA BTOP grant. Capital spending continues to be our primary recurring investing activity and allows us to expand and enhance our network and service offerings, and remain competitive. We continue to focus on strategic investments in success based and network expansion projects, such as last mile builds to customer premises, fiber connections to cellular towers and expansion in key strategic locations, along with required spending to add capacity and maintain our network. Investment in business services will continue to support growth and customer demand in backhaul transport services optimizing long term revenue opportunities. During 2013, 67% of our capital spending was success based, 17% related to network expansion and reliability, 10% focused on maintenance and the remainder was for other miscellaneous projects. Based on current short range planning, we expect our capital spending during 2014 to range between $24,000,000 and $28,000,000. Unforeseeable situations or opportunities may arise which could either increase or decrease the amount of capital spending. Our Greater Minnesota Broadband Collaborative project which was being funded in part by the NTIA BTOP grant was completed in July of 2013. The project extended our fiber optic network across greater Minnesota providing the opportunity for governmental, educational and healthcare organizations to access a high capacity broadband network. All construction was completed as required under the contract agreement. Total allowable costs of $21,096,000 were incurred during the three year grant and subsequent closeout period. Seventy percent of this amount, or $14,767,000, was reimbursed by the NTIA. Financing activities primarily consist of borrowings and payments on our credit facility and the payment of dividends to our shareholders. On October 30, 2013 we amended our current credit facility. Proceeds from this amendment were used to repay the outstanding obligations under the previous credit facility. The primary reason for the $18,208,000 decrease in financing activities is due to entering into an Incremental Term credit facility in 2012 to fund the purchase of IdeaOne Telecom. As part of our Board of Directors authorized stock purchase plan, in 2013, we acquired and retired 124,285 shares of our common stock for $1,275,000; we did not repurchase shares of our common stock in 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we used $7,937,000 and $7,620,000 in cash to make dividend payments to our shareholders, respectively. Our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, representing a 3.0% increase from the previous dividend on August 15, 2013. We expect to pay similar dividends in the future, determined quarterly at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent upon many factors, such as: operating results, capital requirements, debt compliance and other factors. Our long term obligations, including current maturities of debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $135,207,000 and $136,781,000, respectively. Our credit facility requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. The financial ratios required by our credit facility are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("non GAAP financial measures"). The non GAAP financial measures are presented below for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with our debt covenants: (Dollars in thousands) Leverage Ratio: December 31, 2013 (A) Total debt (including outstanding letters of credit) $ 135,227 (B) EBITDA per our credit agreement Three Months Ended 12 31 13 12,019 Three Months Ended 9 30 13 11,801 Three Months Ended 6 30 13 12,276 Three Months Ended 3 31 13 11,501 Total EBITDA per our credit agreement $ 47,597 Total Leverage Ratio (A)/(B) 2.84 Maximum leverage ratio allowed per our credit facility 3.5 39 Table of Contents Debt Service Coverage Ratio: December 31, 2013 (A) EBITDA per our credit agreement, minus $ 47,597 Income Taxes (5,286 ) $ 42,311 (B) the sum of (i) all scheduled principal payments to be made on debt and (ii) interest expense $ 6,256 Debt Service Coverage Ratio (A)/(B) 6.8 Minimum debt service ratio allowed per our credit facility 2.5 Additional disclosure relating to our long term debt and revolving credit facilities can be found in Note 9 "Debt and Other Obligations."

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of our variable rate debt obligations (see Note 12 "Financial Derivative Instruments"). (B) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for equipment purchases and maintenance contracts. (C) Pension benefit obligations consist of the expected net premium payment for healthcare and life insurance benefits to be paid relative to our post retirement benefit plan. In addition, we have change of control agreements with key executives. These potential commitments are not included in the above schedule. We have an extended term payable liability of $8,879,000, as of December 31, 2013 payable in 2014. This commitment is not included in the above schedule. As of December 31, 2013, we recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately $240,000 (net of tax) excluding interest. The liability has not been assigned to any particular year in the table above due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing and necessity of future cash outflows. 40 Table of Contents Reconciliation of non GAAP financial measures In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we also use certain non GAAP measures including EBITDA and EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreement) to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. These non GAAP measures are also used to manage and evaluate the operating performance of our reportable segments. These financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as a measure of performance and net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it provides (1) additional information with respect to our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements, (2) helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies with different capital structures or tax rates, (3) comparison of our business segments performance to other public companies and (4) is a leading component of incentive based compensation for operating management. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are provided below.

We presently give accounting recognition to the actions of regulators where appropriate. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of accounting estimates and the related Management Discussion and Analysis disclosure with the Audit Committee. For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2013. Revenue Recognition See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." We recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the product has occurred or a service has been provided, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. 41 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Uncollectible accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts and removed from the accounts receivable balances when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. This allowance is based on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivables based on past experience and managements best estimates of current bad debt exposures. If our customers creditworthiness deteriorates, actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which would have an impact on our financial results. Inventories and Materials and Supplies We value our inventories using the lower of cost or market method. We adjust our inventory carrying value for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory to the estimated market value based on replacement costs or upon assumptions about future consumption, technology changes, customer demands and market conditions. Our materials and supplies are valued at cost. We adjust our materials and supplies when circumstances indicate the carrying value is not fully recoverable. Our estimates are based on estimated use in capital projects. Reductions to the carrying values of inventory and materials and supplies establish a new, lower cost basis for inventory, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not restore the former cost basis or increase a formerly established cost basis. Financial Derivative Instruments We believe it is prudent to limit the variability of our interest expense. We enter into fixed interest rate swap agreements (financial derivative instruments) to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our variable interest rate debt. Our interest rate swaps increase or decrease the amount of cash paid for interest depending on the increase or decrease of interest required on our variable rate debt. We account for our financial derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging." ASC 815 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value, and that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair value estimate of our interest rate swaps represent the net present value of future cash flows based on projections of the three month LIBOR rate over the life of each swap. Our interest rate swaps are designated as hedges. Therefore, we record changes in fair value of the effective portions of cash flow hedges as a component of other comprehensive income in the current period and subsequently reclassify into earnings when the underlying hedged transactions affects earnings. Amounts related to our derivatives will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as interest payments are accrued or made on our variable rate debt. The ineffective portion of the fair value of derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness is attributable to the swaps having a non zero fair value at the time they were designated. If we were to terminate our interest rate swap positions, any related balance in accumulated other comprehensive income would immediately be recognized in earnings or reclassified into earnings as the interest payments are made dependent on the facts and circumstances of the termination. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. See Note 12 "Financial Derivative Instruments." Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual testing date is October 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using industry and peer specific valuation methods and trading multiples common to our industry. During the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test. 42 Table of Contents Income Taxes In accounting for income taxes, deferred income taxes are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results, or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary from our assumptions, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the "more likely than not" criteria. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense. We are required to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. See additional disclosures in Note 11 "Income Taxes." As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatments of items, such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not likely, the carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. To the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or increase an allowance in a period, it must be included as an expense within the tax provision in the Statements of Income. We had valuation allowances of $1,585,000 and $1,574,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to uncertainty about the realization of certain benefits associated with net operating losses generated in the states of Iowa and Minnesota. In addition, we carry reserves for income tax contingencies. These reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities. We believe our current income tax reserves are adequate. However, the ultimate outcome may differ from estimates, and assumptions could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Post Retirement Benefits We provide retirement savings benefits and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees. The post retirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the discount rate and the expected health care cost trend rate. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly impact our post retirement benefit costs and obligations. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" along with Note 10 "Employee Retirement Benefits." Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation for financial statement purposes is determined using the straight line method based on the estimated economical useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets. Our regulated ILEC operations use a composite depreciation method. The composite depreciation rates on the ILEC telephone plant were 3.7%, 3.3% and 4.1% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 3 to 50 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Data on utilization of equipment and asset retirements is reviewed on a consistent basis to determine if adjustments to our depreciation rates are needed. Significant judgment is required in selecting the appropriate estimated economic life of communications and business property and equipment due to the rapid changes in technology along with the competitive environment. See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Incentive and Stock Based Compensation Our employee incentive compensation plans provide for distributions based on achievement of specific organizational operating results or individual employee objectives. For share based payments, we apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for and recording compensation cost. Compensation charges are recognized over the requisite service period as specified by the stock award plan. 43 Table of Contents Performance and stock based awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in compensation expense. See Note 7 "Stock Compensation." Off Balance Sheet Arrangement/Contingent Commitments We are not engaged in any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity, on our access to, or requirements for capital resources. Other We have not conducted any public equity offering in our history and operate with original equity capital, retained earnings and financing in the form of bank term debt with revolving lines of credit. By utilizing cash flow from operations and current asset balances, we believe that we have adequate resources to meet the anticipated operating, capital expenditures and debt service requirements of our current business plan. Recent Accounting Developments See Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations. We are exposed to market risk through interest rate fluctuations related to our variable rate debt under our senior credit agreement. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Our objective for holding derivatives is to minimize interest rate risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures. Variable rate debt instruments are subject to interest rate risk. For any portion of our debt not covered with interest rate swap agreements, our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a portion of our long term debt has variable interest rates based on LIBOR. If interest rates for the portion of our long term debt based on variable rates had averaged an additional 10% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our interest expense would have increased $225,000 and $242,000, respectively. Disclosure relating to our financial derivative instruments can be found in Note 12 "Financial Derivative Instruments". 44 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders Hickory Tech Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Hickory Tech Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hickory Tech Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. As described in Note 6, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments in 2013, and the amounts in the 2011 financial statements relating to reportable segments have been revised to conform to the 2013 composition of reportable segments. We audited the adjustments that were applied to revise the disclosures for reportable segments reflected in the 2011 financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2011 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2011 financial statements taken as a whole. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hickory Tech Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 6, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Moss Adams LLP Spokane, Washington March 6, 2014 45 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Hickory Tech Corporation We have audited Hickory Tech Corporations (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hickory Tech Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Hickory Tech Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and our report dated March 6, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ Moss Adams LLP Spokane, Washington March 6, 2014 46 Table of Contents Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Hickory Tech Corporation We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments to apply the change in segment reporting presentation described in Note 6, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows of Hickory Tech Corporation (a Minnesota Corporation) and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2011.
