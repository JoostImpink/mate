Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in this MD&A are included in Part II Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Overview Penford generates revenues, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing and marketing specialty natural based ingredient systems for food and industrial applications, including fuel grade ethanol. The Company develops and manufactures ingredients with starch as a base, providing value added applications to its customers. Penfords starch products are manufactured primarily from corn and potatoes and are used principally as binders and coatings in paper, packaging and food production and as an ingredient in fuel. Penford manages its business in two segments: Industrial Ingredients and Food Ingredients. These segments are based on broad categories of end market users. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Companys business segment operations. In January 2012, the Company acquired, through purchase and capital lease, the net assets and operations of the business generally known as Carolina Starches, which manufactures and markets industrial potato starch based products and blends for the paper and packaging industries. The acquisition of this business has provided an important source of raw material to support continued growth in the Companys Food Ingredients business and has broadened the Companys portfolio of specialty modified industrial starches. In March 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Gum Technology, an Arizona close corporation, which distributes and blends gums and hydrocolloids for the food and beverage industries in North America and Asia. Gum Technology specializes in developing and producing customized stabilizers to meet customers product formulation needs. This acquisition broadened the Companys Food Ingredients portfolio of functional and specialty ingredient systems. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 14, 2014, the Company and Ingredion entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Ingredion will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $340.0 million. Upon closing of the merger, each outstanding share of the Companys common stock will be converted into the right to receive $19.00 in cash. The merger is subject to certain closing conditions and covenants and provides certain termination rights for the parties to the Merger Agreement. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including sales revenue growth, sales volume growth, gross margins and operating income of the Companys business segments. Results of Operations Executive Overview Consolidated Results of Operations Consolidated sales declined $23.4 million, or 5.0% to $443.9 million from $467.3 million a year ago. The sales decrease was driven by lower pricing in both business units, particularly in the Industrial Ingredients segment, where average unit selling prices for industrial starch products are affected by the changes in corn costs. Consolidated gross margin increased by $9.3 million driven primarily by lower corn costs and volume improvements in both businesses. The Industrial Ingredients business also updated its estimates of 23 Table of Contents useful lives of certain machinery and equipment, which lowered depreciation expense for fiscal 2014 by $1.4 million. Harsh winter conditions in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 negatively affected gross margin in the Industrial Ingredients segment. The Company amended one of its pension plans to cease further benefit accruals for participants. Consolidated pension expense for fiscal 2014 decreased by approximately $0.8 million due to the amendment. The Companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 38%. See below and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Industrial Ingredients Year Ended August 31, 2014 2013 (Dollars in thousands) Sales industrial starch $ 158,379 $ 177,382 Sales ethanol 96,718 96,852 Sales by products 62,186 81,782 Total sales $ 317,283 $ 356,016 Gross margin $ 16,666 $ 10,647 Income (loss) from operations $ 2,587 $ (3,238 ) Industrial Ingredients fiscal 2014 sales of $317.3 million declined $38.7 million, or 10.9%, from fiscal 2013. Industrial starch sales of $158.4 million decreased 10.7% primarily due to a lower pass through of corn costs to customers as corn prices declined during fiscal 2014. Sales of bioproducts, included in the industrial starch sales category, increased 11% on volume growth of 7% and an increase in average unit selling prices of 4%. Fiscal 2014 sales of ethanol were comparable to last year. A 6% increase in ethanol volumes was offset by a 6% decline in average per gallon sales prices. Sales of by products decreased $19.6 million, or 24%, primarily due to lower pricing for corn by products, as corn costs declined in fiscal 2014. Gross margin increased $6.0 million to $16.6 million in fiscal 2014 from $10.6 million a year ago. Margins expanded due to lower raw material costs, primarily corn, of $14.1 million, higher sales volume of $1.7 million and a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.4 million, partially offset by lower pricing of $6.0 million, higher energy costs of $4.3 million and an increase of $1.2 million in maintenance and distribution costs caused by the harsh winter weather conditions in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by a reduction of $0.4 million in other manufacturing costs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the Industrial Ingredients segment changed its estimates of useful lives of certain machinery and equipment to better match depreciation expense with the periods in which these assets are expected to generate revenue. The change in estimated useful lives lowered depreciation expense as compared to the amount that would have been recorded using the historical estimated useful lives. The effect of this change on operating income of the Industrial Ingredients business for fiscal 2014 was an increase in operating income of $1.4 million. The Company expects, based on its current level of operations and investment in property, plant and equipment, that the effect of this change in depreciable lives for fiscal 2015 will be a decrease in depreciation expense from fiscal 2014 of approximately $3.4 million. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating income for fiscal 2014 expanded $5.8 million over fiscal 2013 due the improvement in gross margin. Operating and research and development expenses of $14.1 million were comparable to the prior year. 24 Table of Contents Food Ingredients Year Ended August 31, 2014 2013 (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 126,590 $ 111,234 Gross margin $ 37,641 $ 34,399 Income from operations $ 24,345 $ 23,265 Sales of $126.6 million for the year ended August 31, 2014 increased 13.8%, or $15.4 million. The Gum Technology business, which was acquired in March 2014, contributed $5.1 million to fiscal 2014 sales growth. Sales, excluding Gum Technology, grew 9.3% on volume growth of 15%, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and pricing of 5%. Sales of non coating and coating applications expanded 12% and 3%, respectively, during fiscal 2014. Gross margin improved $3.2 million in fiscal 2014 over the prior year. Increased volume and lower manufacturing costs contributed $5.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, to the gross margin expansion. Partially offsetting these factors were higher raw material costs of $3.9 million and unfavorable pricing and mix of $0.8 million. Income from operations grew $1.1 million on the increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating and research and development expenses. Operating and research and development expenses increased $2.2 million on higher employee costs of $1.3 million and additional expenses of Gum Technology of $0.9 million. Corporate Operating Expenses Corporate operating expenses increased $1.1 million on an increase in employee costs and higher professional fees. Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Industrial Ingredients Year Ended August 31, 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Sales industrial starch $ 177,382 $ 156,945 Sales ethanol 96,852 101,874 Sales by products 81,782 71,788 Total sales $ 356,016 $ 330,607 Gross margin $ 10,647 $ 11,744 Loss from operations $ (3,238 ) $ (928 ) Industrial Ingredients fiscal 2013 sales of $356.0 million grew $25.4 million, or 7.7%, over fiscal 2012. Industrial starch sales of $177.4 million increased 13% due to (1) additional sales of $12.2 million from the January 2012 acquisition of Carolina Starches, (2) increased average unit pricing of $3.2 million and (3) the pass through of higher corn costs to customers. Sales of bioproducts, included in the industrial starch sales category, were comparable to those generated in 2012. Fiscal 2013 sales of ethanol constituted 27.2% of industrial sales in fiscal 2013 compared to 30.8% in fiscal 2012. Sales of ethanol decreased $5.0 million due to a 7% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 3% increase in average unit pricing. Sales of by products increased $10.0 million, or 13.9%, primarily due to favorable pricing for meal and feed. Gross margin decreased $1.1 million to $10.6 million in fiscal 2013 from $11.7 million in fiscal 2012. Margins declined due to lower volume of $0.7 million, higher corn costs of $6.7 million that could not be passed through to customers and increased personnel costs of $2.0 million, partially offset by $8.0 million in favorable pricing and product mix and $0.3 million of lower manufacturing costs. 25 Table of Contents The loss from operations for fiscal 2013 was $3.2 million compared with a loss of $0.9 million in fiscal 2012. The change in the operating loss was due to the decrease in gross margin described above, $0.9 million of additional operating expenses related the acquisition of Carolina Starches in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and $0.6 million in higher employee costs for commercial and business development resources, partially offset by lower professional fees of $0.3 million. Food Ingredients Year Ended August 31, 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 111,234 $ 102,544 Gross margin $ 34,399 $ 32,165 Income from operations $ 23,265 $ 21,591 Sales of $111.2 million for the year ended August 31, 2013 increased 8.5%, or $8.7 million, on volume growth of 7% and favorable product mix and pricing of 2%. Sales of non coating applications expanded 14%, with revenues from gluten free, dairy and soups/sauces/gravy applications growing at double digit rates. Sales of coating applications declined slightly on lower volume of 3%, partially offset by higher unit pricing of 1%. Gross margin improved $2.2 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012. Increased volume and favorable pricing and mix contributed $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively, to the gross margin expansion. Partially offsetting these factors were higher raw material costs of $0.7 million and increased manufacturing costs of $0.1 million. Income from operations grew $1.7 million on the increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher operating and research and development expenses. Operating and research and development expenses increased $0.6 million on higher employee, marketing and software costs. Corporate Operating Expenses Corporate operating expenses increased less than $0.1 million on higher professional fees, partially offset by lower employee related costs. Non Operating Income (Expense) Other non operating income (expense) consisted of the following: Year Ended August 31, 2014 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Loan forgiveness $ 1,000 $ $ Loss on extinguishment of debt (265 ) Loss on redemption of Series A Preferred Stock (6,599 ) Other 31 75 413 $ 766 $ 75 $ (6,186 ) On August 1, 2014, the Company refinanced its bank debt. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the refinancing, the Company recognized a pre tax, non cash charge to earnings of approximately $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to unamortized transaction fees associated with the prior credit facility. In May 2014, the Company was notified by the Iowa Department of Economic Development that its obligations to maintain certain levels of employment at the Cedar Rapids plant had been met and that repayment of the $1.0 million forgivable loan had been waived. The Company recorded the loan forgiveness of $1.0 million as non operating income. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents In fiscal 2012, the Company redeemed 100,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock at the original issue price of $40.0 million plus accrued dividends of $8.9 million. As a result of the early redemptions, the Company recorded accelerated discount accretion of $5.5 million and amortization of issuance costs of $1.1 million as a loss on redemption in other non operating income (expense). Interest Expense Interest expense was $3.6 million, $4.0 million and $8.6 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest expense declined in fiscal 2014 due to both lower average debt balances and lower interest rates compared to the previous year. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the redemption of the Companys 15% Series A Preferred Stock in fiscal 2012. The dividend rate of 15% on the Series A Preferred Stock was higher than the interest rates on the Companys bank debt, which are based on LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or the banks prime rate plus a margin. Income Taxes The effective tax rate of 38% for fiscal 2014 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, somewhat offset by the partial reversal of a tax valuation allowance due to the utilization of ethanol tax credit carryforwards and the net reductions in unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The effective tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2013 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and the tax effect of expiring and exercised stock options, offset by tax credits for research and development expenditures, net reductions in unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitation and the partial reversal of the Companys valuation allowance due ethanol credit carryforwards. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded $4.8 million of tax expense on a pre tax loss of $4.8 million. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to $13.0 million of non deductible expenses related to the Companys Series A Preferred Stock ($5.4 million of dividends, $6.3 million of discount amortization and $1.3 million of amortization of issuance costs) and a $1.8 million valuation allowance related to the small ethanol producer tax credit carryforwards. Tax laws require that any net operating loss carryforwards be utilized before the Company can utilize the small ethanol producer tax credit carryforwards. Due to the near term expiration of the small ethanol producer tax credit carryforward period, the Company did not believe it had sufficient positive evidence to substantiate that the small ethanol tax credit carryforwards were realizable at a more likely than not level of assurance and recorded a $1.8 million valuation allowance. In fiscal years 2013 and 2014, approximately $0.3 million of the ethanol tax credit had been utilized; the remainder of the tax credit carryforward expired and the valuation allowance was reversed. At August 31, 2014, the Company had $2.0 million of U.S. net deferred tax assets. Other than a valuation allowance of $0.1 million for state tax credits, a valuation allowance has not been provided on the net U.S. deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2014. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance requires significant judgment and estimates. The Company evaluates the requirement for a valuation allowance each quarter. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets. However, there can be no assurance that managements current plans will be achieved or that a valuation allowance will not be required in the future. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary sources of short and long term liquidity are cash flow from operations and its revolving line of credit, which expires on August 1, 2019. The Company expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to have sufficient borrowing capacity and ability to fund its cash requirements during fiscal 2015. Year Ended August 31, 2014 2013 2012 (Dollars in thousands) Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 18,054 $ 24,649 $ 2,560 Net cash used in investing activities (22,325 ) (12,062 ) (22,418 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,239 (12,520 ) 19,731 Net increase (decrease) in cash $ (32 ) $ 67 $ (127 ) Operating Activities At August 31, 2014, Penford had working capital of $59.4 million, and $76.0 million outstanding under its $145 million revolving credit facility. Cash flow generated from operations of $18.1 million in fiscal year 2014 decreased $6.6 million from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to higher inventories at the Food Ingredients segment related to the acquisition of Gum Technology inventory and to support future sales levels. During fiscal 2015, the Company expects to utilize its remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards, which, depending on the level of taxable income generated in fiscal 2015, will require the Company to make cash federal income tax payments. Cash flow generated from operations of $24.6 million in fiscal year 2013 increased $22.1 million from fiscal 2012. The increase was due to higher earnings, lower inventories, lower minimum pension contributions and reductions in interest costs with the redemption of the Companys preferred stock in fiscal 2012. Investing Activities Capital expenditures were $13.0 million, $14.2 million and $14.1 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Penford expects capital expenditures to be approximately $25 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2013, the Company settled a claim against a contractor and its insurer that arose from engineering design work performed in connection with the construction of the Companys ethanol plant. Approximately $2.1 million of the settlement was reflected as a reduction of the cost of the ethanol plant. In March 2014, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Gum Technology, which distributes and blends gums and hydrocolloids for the food and beverage industries in North America and Asia. Gum Technology specializes in developing and producing customized stabilizers to meet customers product formulation needs. This acquisition broadens the Companys Food Ingredients portfolio of functional and specialty ingredient systems. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2012, the Company purchased the businesses of Carolina Starches for $8.5 million in cash. Cash acquired in the purchase transaction was $0.2 million. Financing Activities Preferred Stock In fiscal 2010, the Company issued $40.0 million of mandatorily redeemable Series A 15% cumulative non voting, non convertible preferred stock and 100,000 shares of Series B voting convertible preferred stock in a private placement to Zell Credit Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., an investment fund managed by Equity Group Investments, a private investment firm. Proceeds from the preferred stock issuance of $40.0 million were used to repay bank debt in fiscal 2010. 28 Table of Contents During fiscal 2012, the Company redeemed all of its Series A Preferred Stock at the original issue price of $40.0 million plus accrued dividends of $8.9 million. As a result of the early redemption, the Company recorded accelerated discount accretion of $5.5 million and amortization of issuance costs of $1.1 million as a loss on the redemption in other non operating income (expense). The redemptions were funded by available balances on the Companys revolving line of credit. During fiscal 2012, the Investor converted its 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock into 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Bank Debt In July 2012, in connection with the redemption of $40.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company refinanced its obligations then outstanding. The Company entered into a $130 million Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 2012 Agreement) with a group of lenders with Bank of Montreal as Administrative Agent. On August 1, 2014, the Company refinanced its obligations then outstanding under the 2012 Agreement and entered into a $145 million Credit Agreement (the 2014 Agreement) with the following banks: Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen Boerenleenbank B.A., Rabobank Nederland New York Branch (Rabobank); KeyBank National Association; JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.; First Midwest Bank; the Private Bank and Trust Company; GreenStone Farm Credit Services, ACA; Branch Banking and Trust Company; AgStar Financial Services PCA and Farm Credit Services of America, PCA. Under the 2014 Agreement, the Company may borrow $145 million in revolving lines of credit. The lenders revolving credit loan commitment may be increased under certain conditions. Under the 2014 Agreement, there are no scheduled principal payments prior to maturity on August 1, 2019. On August 31, 2014, the Company had $76.0 million outstanding under the 2014 Agreement, which is subject to variable interest rates. Interest rates under the 2014 Agreement are based on either a base rate or a eurodollar rate, depending on the Companys selection of available borrowing options, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin varies from 1% to 2.5% for base rate loans and from 2% to 3.5% for eurodollar loans, depending on the Companys Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2014 Agreement. The 2014 Agreement provides that the Total Leverage Ratio, which is computed as funded debt divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the 2014 Agreement) shall not exceed 5.00 through August 31, 2015; 4.50 from November 30, 2015 through August 31, 2016; 4.25 from November 30, 2016 through August 31, 2017; and 3.75 thereafter. In addition, the Company must maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the 2014 Agreement, of not less than 1.25. Beginning in fiscal year 2015, annual capital expenditures are restricted to $25 million. Maximum annual capital expenditures may be increased to $35 million if the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 2.00 for the last two fiscal quarters of the year. To the extent that annual capital expenditures are less than the maximum, the difference between the actual and maximum capital expenditures will be added to the capital expenditures permitted in the immediately succeeding fiscal year. The Companys obligations under the 2014 Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys assets. The Company was in compliance with the covenants in the 2014 Agreement as of August 31, 2014. Also on August 1, 2014, the Company entered into a $25 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with Rabobank. The Term Loan Agreement provides the Company with a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount up to $25 million. The term loan facility may be utilized in a series of up to six drawings until the 18 month anniversary of the date of the Term Loan Agreement. Any unused portion of the lenders commitment to make term loans under this facility will expire on the 18 month anniversary of the closing date. The maturity date for loans under the Term Loan Agreement is July 31, 29 Table of Contents 2020, and there are no scheduled principal payments due prior to maturity. The Companys obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured on a second priority basis by substantially all of the Companys assets. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of August 31, 2014. The Term Loan Agreement provides that the Total Leverage Ratio, which is computed as funded debt divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) shall not exceed 5.50 through August 31, 2015; 5.00 from November 30, 2015 through August 31, 2016; 4.75 from November 30, 2016 through August 31, 2017; and 4.25 thereafter. In addition, the Company must maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, of not less than 1.10. Dividends Pursuant to the 2014 Agreement, the Company may declare and pay dividends on its common stock in an amount not to exceed, in any consecutive four quarters, the lesser of $10 million or 50% of Free Cash Flow, as defined. As of August 31, 2014, the Company was not permitted to pay dividends. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the Companys financial position and results of operations. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on the Companys historical experience and managements knowledge and understanding of the current facts and circumstances. Management believes that its estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared. To the extent there are material differences between estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual results, the financial statements will be affected. Management has reviewed the accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The estimates that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments included the following: Evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable Hedging activities Benefit plans Long lived assets Valuation of goodwill Self insurance program Income taxes Stock based compensation A description of each of these follows: Evaluation of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable Management makes judgments about the Companys ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables that the Company may not be able to collect. Penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience, known troubled accounts, industry trends, 30 Table of Contents economic conditions, how recently payments have been received and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. If the estimates do not reflect the Companys future ability to collect outstanding invoices, Penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Hedging Activities Penford uses derivative instruments, primarily exchange traded futures contracts, to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the United States. The Company relies upon exchange settlement to address the default risk exposure. Penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges. For cash flow hedging activities, this election allows the Company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying exposure affects earnings. For fair value hedging activities, the gain or loss on the derivative instruments offset gains or losses on the hedged item. The requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex, and require judgments and analyses to qualify as hedges as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks. If the Company were to fail to meet the requirements to qualify for derivative accounting, or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges, the Company would be required to mark these contracts to fair value at each reporting date through current earnings. Effective August 1, 2014, the Company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for corn futures contracts as the hedging relationship no longer met the requirements for hedge accounting. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Benefit Plans Penford has defined benefit plans for some employees, providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care. Qualified third party actuaries assist management in determining the recorded liabilities, expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans. Management makes several estimates and assumptions in order to measure the expense and funded status, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on plan assets, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates and increases in the cost of medical care. The Company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience, as well as available historical market data and trends. However, if these assumptions are wrong, it could materially affect the amounts reported in the Companys future results of operations. Disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans below. Long Lived Assets The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using an income approach (discounted cash flows) or a market based approach. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic and industry specific conditions, product pricing, sales volume and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that managements current projections of cash flows will be achieved or that an impairment charge will not be required in the future. An impairment charge could be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill Penford is required to assess, on an annual basis, whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired, or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be impairment. These assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill. While the Company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process, their work is based on the Companys estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business segments. If future operating results differ materially from the estimates, the value of goodwill and profitability could be adversely impacted. Self Insurance Program The Company maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation and group health liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claim occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions. The financial results of the Company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining these liabilities. Income Taxes The determination of the Companys provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The Companys provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances and the Companys change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance on the Companys net deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable income, the timing of the tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company evaluates the requirement for a valuation allowance each quarter. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax return position will be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because the Company is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the various tax filing positions. Management believes that the judgments and estimates it uses in evaluating its tax filing positions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and the Company may be exposed to significant gains and losses and the Companys effective tax rate and cash flow in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Based Compensation The Company provides compensation in the form of stock options or restricted shares of common stock to employees and non employee directors under its 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan. Share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense utilizing the accelerated multiple options approach over the requisite service period of the award, which equals the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates, the risk free interest rate, dividends and expected option life. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents If circumstances change and the Company uses different assumptions for volatility, interest, dividends and option life in estimating the fair value of stock based awards granted in future periods, stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period. Forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimated. Therefore, if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from those estimated, the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. Contractual Obligations As more fully described in Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is a party to various debt and lease agreements at August 31, 2014 that contractually commit the Company to pay certain amounts in the future. Purchase obligations at August 31, 2014 represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations incurred during the Companys normal course of business for commitments to purchase goods and services for production and inventory needs, such as raw materials, supplies, manufacturing arrangements, capital expenditures and maintenance. The terms of the majority of these obligations allow the Company or its suppliers the option to cancel or adjust the requirements based on business needs. The following table summarizes such contractual commitments at August 31, 2014 (in thousands): 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 & After Total Long term debt and capital lease obligations (3) $ 184 $ 434 $ 76,225 $ 6 $ 76,849 Postretirement medical (1) 854 1,942 2,348 7,638 12,782 Defined benefit pensions (2) Operating lease obligations 5,928 8,295 4,898 8,158 27,279 Purchase obligations 70,809 10,680 569 82,058 $ 77,775 $ 21,351 $ 84,040 $ 15,802 $ 198,968 (1) Represent estimated contributions to the unfunded postretirement medical plan in amounts needed to fund expected benefit payments for participants through fiscal 2024 based on actuarial assumptions. (2) The Company is not required to make contributions to its pension plans during fiscal 2015. Contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2016 and beyond are not known. (3) Interest on the Companys revolving bank debt varies with either the LIBOR Index Rate or the prime rate and the outstanding amount of debt, and is not included herein. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans Penford maintains two defined benefit pension plans and one defined benefit postretirement health care plan in the United States. In fiscal 2014, the Company amended its defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees to cease the further accrual of participant benefits. Pension expense for fiscal 2014 decreased by approximately $0.8 million due to the amendment. The most significant assumptions used to determine benefit expense and benefit obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the assumptions used by Penford. 33 Table of Contents The discount rate used by the Company in determining benefit expense and benefit obligations reflects the yield of high quality (AA or better rating by a recognized rating agency) corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments. Benefit obligations and expense increase as the discount rate is reduced. The discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in 2014 (5.24%), 2013 (4.28%) and 2012 (5.87%) reflect the changes in bond yields over the past several years. Lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase pension expense by approximately $0.2 million and other postretirement benefit expense would change by an insignificant amount. During fiscal 2014, bond yields declined and Penford decreased the discount rate for calculating its benefit obligations at August 31, 2014, as well as net periodic expense for fiscal 2015, to 4.39%. The expected long term return on assets assumption for the pension plans represents the weighted average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. Pension expense increases as the expected return on plan assets decreases. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long term historical market rates of return, as well as actual returns on the Companys plan assets, and adjusts this information to reflect expected capital market trends. Penford also considers forward looking return expectations by asset class, the contribution of active management and management fees paid by the plans. The plan assets are held in qualified trusts, and anticipated rates of return are not reduced for income taxes. The expected long term return on assets assumption used to calculate net periodic pension expense was 7.0% for fiscal 2014. A 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on assets assumptions would increase (decrease) pension expense by approximately $0.3 million based on plan assets at August 31, 2014. The expected return on plan assets used in calculating fiscal 2015 pension expense is 7.0%. Unrecognized net loss amounts reflect the difference between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Unrecognized net losses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of active employees. As of August 31, 2014, unrecognized losses from all sources were $6.6 million for the pension plans and $1.6 million for the postretirement health care plan. Amortization of unrecognized net loss amounts is expected to increase net pension expense by approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2015. Amortization of unrecognized net losses is not expected to increase net postretirement health care expense in fiscal 2015. Penford recognized pension expense of $1.4 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Penford expects pension expense to be approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2015. The Company contributed $2.5 million, $1.1 million and $4.1 million to the pension plans in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Penford estimates that it will not be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans during fiscal 2015. The Company recognized benefit expense for its postretirement health care plan of $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Penford expects to recognize approximately $0.9 million in postretirement health care benefit expense in fiscal 2015. The Company contributed $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 to the postretirement health care plan and estimates that it will contribute $0.8 million in fiscal 2015. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various assumptions related to the participants in the defined benefit plans will affect future benefit expense and liabilities. The Company cannot predict what these changes will be. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Adopted In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance requiring entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Entities are required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, 34 Table of Contents significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. This guidance did not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. The Company adopted this guidance effective September 1, 2013, and the required disclosure is presented in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance creating new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entitys rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The Company adopted this guidance effective September 1, 2013, and the required disclosure is presented in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance designed to reduce diversity in practice of financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted this accounting presentation effective September 1, 2013. The Company complied with the prescribed accounting presentation in prior periods; therefore, the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the presentation of the Companys financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on September 1, 2017, and early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Annual Report), including, but not limited, to statements found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1 Business and Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In particular, statements pertaining to anticipated operations and business strategies contain forward looking statements. Likewise, statements regarding anticipated changes in the Companys business and anticipated market conditions are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. Forward looking statements depend on assumptions, dates or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise, and the Company may not be able to realize them. Forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates, or anticipates, or the negative use of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. Forward looking statements can be identified by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward looking statements: competition; the possibility of interruption of business activities due to equipment problems, accidents, strikes, weather or other factors; product development risk; changes in corn and other raw material prices and availability; changes in general economic conditions or developments with respect to specific industries or customers affecting demand for the Companys products, including unfavorable shifts in product mix or changes in government rules or incentives affecting ethanol consumption; 35 Table of Contents unanticipated costs, expenses or third party claims; the risk that results may be affected by construction delays, cost overruns, technical difficulties, nonperformance by contractors or changes in capital improvement project requirements or specifications; interest rate, chemical and energy cost volatility; changes in returns on pension plan assets and or assumptions used for determining employee benefit expense and obligations; other unforeseen developments in the industries in which Penford operates; the Companys ability to successfully operate under and comply with the terms of its bank credit agreement, as amended; and other factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions Penford is exposed to market risks that are inherent in the financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business. Penford may use various hedge instruments to manage or reduce market risk, but the Company does not use derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. The primary market risks are discussed below. Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its variable rate borrowings. As of August 31, 2014, all of the Companys outstanding bank debt is subject to variable interest rates, which are generally set for one or three months. The market risk associated with a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates at August 31, 2014 was approximately $0.8 million. Commodity Risk The availability and price of corn, Penfords most significant raw material, is subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather, plantings, domestic and foreign governmental farm programs and policies, changes in global demand and the worldwide production of corn. To reduce the price risk caused by market fluctuations, Penford generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures to hedge exposure to corn price fluctuations in North America. These futures contracts were designated for accounting purposes as hedging instruments through July 31, 2014. Effective August 1, 2014, the Company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for corn futures contracts as the hedging relationship no longer met the requirements for hedge accounting. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A majority of the Companys sales contracts for corn based industrial starch ingredients contain a pricing methodology, which allows the Company to pass through the majority of the changes in the commodity price of net corn. Penfords net corn position in the U.S. consists primarily of inventories, purchase contracts and exchange traded futures contracts that hedge Penfords exposure to commodity price fluctuations. The fair value of the position is based on quoted market prices. The Company has estimated its market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in prices. The fair value of the Companys net corn position at August 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $2.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The market risk associated with a 10% adverse change in corn prices at August 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $213,000 and $240,000, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Selling prices for ethanol fluctuate based on the availability and price of manufacturing inputs and the status of various government regulations and tax incentives. To reduce the risk of the price variability of ethanol, Penford enters into exchange traded futures contracts to hedge exposure to ethanol price fluctuations. These futures contracts have been designated as hedging instruments. Penfords exchange traded futures contracts hedge the forecasted sales of ethanol. The fair value of these contracts is based on quoted market prices. The Company has estimated its market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in prices. As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the ethanol exchange traded futures contracts was a loss of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The market risk associated with a 10% change in ethanol prices was estimated at $110,000 and $100,000 at August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 37 Table of Contents
