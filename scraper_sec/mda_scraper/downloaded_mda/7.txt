Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Overview. The Company is one of the nations leading producers of construction aggregates, a major provider of ready mix concrete and concrete products in the Southeastern and Mid Atlantic States and a significant supplier of cement in Florida and Georgia. We operate through three business segments: construction aggregates, concrete products, and cement and calcium. The construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining, processing, distribution and sale of sand, gravel and crushed stone. The concrete products segment is engaged in production and sale of ready mix concrete, concrete block, prestressed concrete as well as sales of other building materials. The cement and calcium products segment is engaged in the production and sale of Portland and masonry cement, the importation of cement and slag which are either sold or ground or blended and then sold and the sale of calcium products to the animal feed industry. During fiscal 2007, our business was significantly affected by the dramatic downturn in residential construction activity in Florida. For the contribution made to net sales and operating profit from each business segment, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 19, 2007, we agreed to merge with Vulcan Materials Company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 19, 2007. The merger was approved by our shareholders on August 14, 2007, and is expected to close on or about November 16, 2007. Our Business We are a major basic construction materials company concentrating on growth markets in the Southeastern and Mid Atlantic states. We operate in three business segments: construction aggregates, cement and calcium products, and concrete products. Construction Aggregates. Our construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining, processing, distribution and sale of crushed stone, sand and gravel. Our construction aggregates segment operates plants in multiple states: Crushed Base Rock Sand, Gravel and Distribution Stone Plants Plants Industrial Sand Terminals Florida 3 2 10 3 Georgia 7 3 2 Tennessee 1 Alabama 1 1 Maryland 2 2 4 Delaware 1 Virginia 2 2 2 Illinois 1 Kentucky 1 Louisiana 1 Canada 1 Bahamas 1 Note: Chart includes one joint venture crushed stone plant in Georgia and one joint venture crushed stone plant in Canada. During fiscal 2007 we produced and shipped 36.2 million tons of construction aggregates. Currently, we have 2.1 billion tons of permitted reserves. Concrete Products Segment. Our concrete products segment produces and sells ready mix concrete, concrete block, prestressed and precast concrete and sells other building materials in multiple states: 19 Table of Contents Ready Mix Concrete Concrete Prestress Precast Plants Block Plants Plants Plant Florida 62 12 1 Georgia 10 1 North Carolina 2 Virginia 37 District of Columbia 2 Maryland 6 Bahamas 1 1 In 2007, we had a delivery fleet of 1,276 ready mix and block trucks. Cement and Calcium Products. Our cement and calcium products segment operates a cement plant in Newberry, Florida, import terminals and grinding facilities in Tampa and Port Manatee, Florida and a limestone grinding facility in Brooksville, Florida. Our Newberry cement plant produced 685,000 tons of cement in 2007. Construction to double the annual production capacity of this plant continued in 2007. Construction is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2009. Our Tampa facility imports, blends or bags and sells cement and grinds, blends and sells granulate blast furnace slag. Our Port Manatee facility imports and grinds clinker (unground cement) and sells the ground cement. Our Brooksville facility operates a limestone grinding plant that provides product for the animal feed industry and paint, plastic and joint compound industries. Business Environment Our business principally serves customers in the construction industry. Our business is impacted by a number of factors affecting the construction industry and the economy as a whole. Although a number of different factors, risks and trends affect our business, we have highlighted some of these factors below: Our Markets. Construction activity and general economic conditions in our principal markets significantly affect our results. The following breakdown shows our sales by market: Market 2007 % of Sales 2006 % of Sales Florida 59.8 65.6 Mid Atlantic 30.1 25.7 Georgia 7.5 7.2 North Carolina .3 .4 Tennessee .6 .5 Illinois .6 .5 Kentucky .6 .2 Alabama .5 Construction Activity. Residential construction has declined dramatically in our Florida markets. We cannot estimate when the housing market will turn around and until residential construction recovers, volumes will continue to trail fiscal 2006 volumes. Construction activity in our markets is affected by a number of factors, including population growth, economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. 20 Table of Contents Our financial results also are affected by highway construction spending levels. On August 10, 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act A Legacy for Users became law, providing $286.5 billion in guaranteed funding for federal highway, transit and safety programs. We expect this legislation to result in modest increases in highway construction spending over the next several years. Cement Supplies. In 2004 there was a severe cement shortage in the Florida market. The cement shortage was fueled by a record level of demand, unusual downtime at some of our competitors plants and limited availability of imports due to stronger international demand, particularly in China, and a shortage of available barges. The cement shortage eased in 2005, although many states in our markets experienced somewhat tight supply conditions. Demand for cement products also weakened in late fiscal 2006 as a result of the slowdown in residential construction. During fiscal 2007, the demand continues to weaken as a result of the slowdown in residential construction. During 2007 due to this weak demand, our Newberry cement plant was shutdown for thirty nine days due to lack of storage space for our product. We began construction of an expansion of our Newberry plant in fiscal 2006. Some of our competitors also either are expanding capacity or building new plants. Additional Factors Influencing Operations. Our operations are influenced by a number of other external and internal factors. External factors include weather, competition, interest rates, fuel costs, transportation costs, driver availability, labor costs and inflation. Internal factors include sales mix, plant location, quality and quantities of aggregates reserves, capacity utilization and other operating factors. In October 2005 a hurricane affected southern Florida and caused a disruption of business during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Rail operations were interrupted, resulting in restricted delivery of product to our terminals. This interruption caused a shortage of aggregate production in some parts of Florida which affected business in areas not affected by the hurricane during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Financial results are affected by planned maintenance at the cement plant since these costs, which can be significant, are expensed when incurred. The Company expensed planned maintenance of $3,800,000 in fiscal 2007, as compared to $4,100,000 in fiscal 2006. The plant was shut down for twenty three days in fiscal 2007 and nineteen days in fiscal 2006 for planned maintenance. Planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 at an estimated cost of $2,900,000 as compared to $2,600,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Planned maintenance costs typically result in an overhaul to the wear parts of the major operating components. Since the cement manufacturing process is continuous, the coordination of the repair to multiple components is paramount. Items that typically are inspected, repaired and or replaced during an outage include: chain and belt conveyors, idlers, rollers, mill journals, impact hammers, grinding table liners, separator blades, mill liners, bearings, fans, ductwork, airslides, grinding media, refractory, castable and shell replacement. Our insurance program consists of the Company self insuring a portion of the claims and paying premiums for coverage in excess of this self insurance retention. The self insurance retention level is determined by comparing the premium for the coverage versus the potential exposure. For the automobile insurance programs, self insurance retention is $3,000,000 per occurrence. For workers compensation and general liability insurance programs, the self insurance retention is $1,000,000 per occurrence with an aggregate of $2,000,000 for general liability. Operating Review. Fiscal 2007 sales declined 21.0% to $1,080,774,000 from $1,367,789,000 for fiscal 2006 due to decreased demand in all three business segments. The primary reason for the revenue decline is volume decreases in all three of our business segments due to a significant slow down in construction 21 Table of Contents activity, particularly in the residential markets. In addition, sales prices for cement decreased slightly due to a change in product mix and lower sales price of concrete block. These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices in our aggregate segment and the higher average selling price of ready mix concrete. In our aggregates segment for the year, volumes at our producing locations were down 19.1% over 2006 volumes, although volume declines were partially offset by a 15.2% increase in the average selling price. Volumes decreased in both our southern and northern operations. In our concrete segment for the year, volumes of ready mix concrete declined 23.1%, while our block volumes were down 44.9% compared to 2006. Sales prices for ready mix concrete increased 5.4% and for concrete block decreased 1.5%. In our cement operations for the year volumes decreased 24.4% and the average selling price of cement declined 0.3%. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 18.6% to $1,367,789,000 from $1,153,452,000 in fiscal 2005 due to increased revenues in all three business segments. These increases were attributable to both increased volumes and sales prices of construction aggregates at producing locations, ready mix concrete, concrete block and building materials, and cement. In our aggregates segment for fiscal 2006, volumes at our producing locations were up 7.0% over 2005 volumes primarily from acquisitions at the end of fiscal 2005 or early fiscal 2006, increased volumes from our quarry on the Ohio River in Illinois acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2005 and from our Georgia and Florida operations. These volume increases were offset by decreases in volumes at our distribution terminals of 4.8% and lower volumes in our Virginia and Maryland markets. In our concrete segment for fiscal 2006, volumes of ready mix concrete were up 3.2%, while our block volumes were down 1.9% compared to 2005. Sales prices for ready mix were up 16.9% and for block were up 19.1%. In our cement operations for fiscal 2006 volumes decreased 2.1% due to lower volumes at our grinding facilities partially offset by increased volumes at the Newberry cement plant. Gross profit for fiscal 2007 decreased 27.4% and gross margin decreased to 29.9% of sales as compared to 32.6% for 2006. We experienced gross profit and gross margin declines in all three business segments due to sales declines. Our business is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed costs. When we experience these levels of decreases in volumes, it will cause a significant decrease in our gross profit margin and gross profit. Construction aggregates declines were primarily due to decreased volumes and higher depreciation expense due to completion of new production facilities and high fixed costs, partially offset by increased prices. The cement and calcium group declines for the year were due to reduced volumes and higher costs. Our concrete products segment for the year declined due to reduced ready mix and block volumes and higher fixed costs partially offset by increased sales prices of ready mix concrete. The cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices. Depreciation expense was approximately $9,743,000 higher, which depressed profit and margin. Gross profit for fiscal 2006 increased 26.9% and gross margin increased to 32.6% of sales as compared to 30.5% for 2005. These increases were due to all three business segments gross profit and gross margin improvements. Construction aggregates improvements were primarily due to higher sales prices and increased volumes. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 benefited from an insurance settlement of 22 Table of Contents $2,116,000 which recovered costs previously expensed. The cement and calcium group improvement for the year was due to price increases partially offset by the reduced volumes. Our concrete products segment for fiscal 2006 improved due to increased sales prices and ready mix volumes. All three segments gross profit and margins were adversely affected by dramatic increases in fuel and energy costs and construction aggregates and concrete products were adversely affected by repairs and maintenance. The cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 also benefited from an insurance settlement of $2,116,000 which recovered costs previously expensed. Fuel costs were $14,464,000 higher in 2006 as compared to 2005. Repair costs increased $5,453,000 in fiscal 2006. Higher depreciation expense of approximately $7,425,000 also depressed profit and margin. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses on a consolidated basis decreased 12.8% in 2007. SGA as a percentage of sales were 10.5% for fiscal 2007 as compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2006. The dollar decrease is due to reduced profit sharing and management incentive compensation, which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains, reduced professional services, reduced contributions and reduced risk insurance cost and a general reduction in selling general and administrative costs. These lower expenses were partially offset by $10,062,000 of costs related to our merger with Vulcan. SGA expense decreased in all three business segments primarily due to profit sharing and management incentive. Without these decreased expenses, SGA expenses for each of the business segments would have decreased slightly. For corporate overhead, SGA expenses increased as a result of merger expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses on a consolidated basis increased 20.0% in 2006 compared to 2005. SGA as a percentage of sales were 9.5% for fiscal 2006 as compared to 9.4% for fiscal 2005. The dollar increase is due to profit sharing and management incentive compensation, which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains, stock option expense related to the adoption of FAS 123R which increased cost by $5,192,000 and legal services. All three business segments had an increase in SGA expense primarily due to profit sharing, management incentive and stock option expenses. Without these increased expenses, SGA expenses for each of the business segments would have increased slightly. For corporate overhead, SGA expenses increased as a result of higher profit sharing, management incentive, stock option expense and professional fees. In fiscal 2005 SGA expenses benefited $556,000 from reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the insurance settlement discussed above and $596,000 from life insurance proceeds Consolidated operating profit decreased to $214,217,000 in 2007 as compared to $319,475,000 for the same period last year. Gains on the sale of real estate this year were $3,928,000 versus $3,569,000 during fiscal 2006. Operating profit for the year for the aggregates group decreased to $103,246,000 from $117,215,000 last year. This was due to a 19.1% decrease in volume partially offset by price increases. The aggregates group did not have real estate gains in fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,685,000 last year. For the concrete products segment, operating profit decreased to $81,452,000 from $148,149,000 last year. This was due to 23.1% decrease in ready mix volumes and a 44.9% decrease in block volumes, partially offset by price increases. For the cement and calcium segment, operating profit decreased to $55,745,000 from $83,600,000 last year. This decrease is primarily due to reduced volumes. Consolidated operating profit increased to $319,475,000 in 2006 as compared to $249,473,000 in 2005. Fiscal 2005 included the gain on the sale of a former quarry and other real estate which resulted in a gain of $6,367,000. Gains on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2006 were $3,569,000. Operating profit for 2006 for the Aggregates group increased to $117,215,000 from $94,552,000. This was due to a 7.0% increase in volume and price increases slightly offset by higher SGA expense and further reduced by higher fuel and repair costs. The aggregates 23 Table of Contents group had real estate gains of $1,685,000 in 2006 as compared to $6,194,000 in fiscal 2005. For the concrete products segment, operating profit increased to $148,149,000 from $118,161,000 in fiscal 2005. This was due to 3.2% increase in ready mix volumes, price increases and additional real estate gains of $1,711,000. These increases were slightly offset by increased fuel and SGA expenses. For the cement and calcium segment, operating profit increased to $83,600,000 from $57,336,000 in 2005. This increase was due to higher prices, partially offset by increased SGA expenses. Interest expense for 2007 increased to $423,000 from $259,000 in 2006 as a result of interest on non debt obligations. Interest of $1,030,000 was capitalized this year as compared to $898,000 last year. Interest expense for 2006 decreased to $259,000 from $1,555,000 in 2005 as a result of lower debt outstanding on revolving credit agreements and capitalization of interest of $898,000. Interest income for 2007 was $2,701,000 as compared to $3,161,000 last year. The decrease is the result of having less average excess cash available during fiscal 2007 for investment in short term investments. The Company ended the year with approximately $34.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Interest income for 2006 was $3,161,000 as compared to $1,260,000 in 2005. Fiscal year 2005s interest income included $604,000 of interest income on the insurance settlement discussed above. The increase was the result of having more excess cash available during fiscal 2006 for investment in short term investments. During fiscal 2006, the Company had very little usage of its revolving credit facilities. The Company ended the year with approximately $93 million of excess cash. Other income decreased $6,270,000 from last year primarily from gains on sale of other assets last year and lower equity in affiliates. Other income for 2006 includes a gain from an exchange of real estate which resulted from a legal settlement of $2,838,000. Also included in other income in fiscal 2006 is a gain of $1,442,000 from the sale of a 15% interest in an affiliate. Included in other income is our 50% equity in the operating results of our joint ventures. During fiscal 2007 this equity in earnings of joint ventures was a loss of $380,000 as compared to $810,000 last year. This loss is the result of reduced volumes. Income tax expense decreased to $76,916,000 in 2007 as compared to $118,675,000 last year. This is due to lower income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 35.3% versus 36.0% last year. Income tax expense increased to $118,675,000 in 2006 as compared to $97,979,000 in 2005. This is due to higher income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 36.0% versus 37.4% last year. The decrease in effective income tax rate is due to the 3% manufacturers credit in fiscal 2006 and an increase in excess percentage depletion as a result of increased revenues. Net earnings for fiscal 2007 were $141,016,000 as compared to $211,409,000 last year. Included in net earnings for this year is the gain on the sale of real estate of $3,928,000 pre tax ($2,541,000 after tax). Included in fiscal 2006 was the gain on the sale of real estate of $3,569,000 ($2,284,000 after tax) and a gain of $2,838,000 pretax from the exchange of real estate ($1,816,000 after tax). Liquidity and Capital Resources. The following key financial measurements reflect the Companys financial position and capital resources at September 30 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,876 93,353 68,921 Total debt $ 20,031 19,702 19,934 Current ratio 1.8 to 1 2.0 to 1 1.8 to 1 Debt as a percent of capital employed 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Unused revolving credit $ 250,000 250,000 250,000 Unused short term lines $ 35,000 35,000 35,000 24 Table of Contents In 2007, cash provided by operations of $206,599,000, sales of assets of $12,613,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $15,721,000 were used to purchase $241,352,000 of property, plant and equipment, for business acquisitions of $30,727,000 and to pay dividends of $29,691,000. In 2006, cash provided by operations of $291,719,000, sales of assets of $9,384,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3,949,000 were used to purchase $158,929,000 of property, plant and equipment, for business acquisitions of $44,030,000, to repurchase stock of $19,898,000 and to pay dividends of $49,197,000. Operating Activities: During fiscal 2007, cash flow provided by operations was $206,599,000. The major reason for the decrease from 2006 was decreased earnings, a decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses partially offset by a decrease in inventory, an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in depreciation and amortization. During fiscal 2006, cash flow provided by operations was $291,719,000. The major reason for the increase from 2005 was increased earnings, an increase in depreciation and amortization, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory. Investing Activities: Cash flow used for investing activities was $267,432,000 for fiscal 2007. This resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $241,352,000 and $30,727,000 used for business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets of $12,613,000. Cash flow used in investing activities was $205,946,000 for fiscal 2006. This resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $158,929,000 and $44,030,000 used for business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets of $9,384,000. Financing Activities: Cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,356,000 in fiscal 2007. The exercise of stock options provided $15,721,000 of funds and the tax benefit related to these exercises provided $31,986,000 of funds. Payment of dividends used $29,691,000 of funds. Cash flow used for financing activities was $61,341,000 in fiscal 2006. During the year, dividends of $49,197,000 were paid and $19,898,000 of common stock was repurchased. The merger with Vulcan is expected to close on November 16, 2007. Future capital expenditures will be determined based on the combined companies future capital expenditure plans. The Company expects that the Purchase and Put Agreements covering $3,550,000 of the Industrial Revenue Bonds (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) will continue to be amended until the earlier of the final maturity date of the respective bonds or until the project financed by the bonds is terminated. To the extent that the bonds mature or the Purchase and Put Agreements are not extended, the Company will repurchase and or repay the bonds with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company believes it will be able to renegotiate its present credit facilities or obtain similar replacement credit facilities when necessary in the future. 25 Table of Contents Capital Resources: Working capital for fiscal 2007 decreased to $109,894,000 from $153,925,000 for fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to decreased cash from operations. Working capital for fiscal 2006 increased to $153,925,000 from $121,545,000 for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to increased cash from operations. Upon completion of the merger with Vulcan, the Companys revolving credit facilities will be terminated and future funding will be provided by Vulcan credit facilities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations, maturities and commitments.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. There are no off balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial calculations. We constantly review these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from estimated results determined using the factors described above. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides detail on the application of these and other accounting policies. These critical accounting policies and Note 2 should be read in conjunction with this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 26 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the accounting policies considered to be most critical to the Company. These accounting policies are both most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed this disclosure regarding Critical Accounting Estimates. Self insurance reserves. It is our policy to self insure for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers compensation, comprehensive general liability, product liability and auto liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Based on an independent actuarys estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and adjusted monthly. The actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources, including changes in claim reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although the Company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the Companys self insurance obligations and future expense. Long lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. An impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net carrying value over the fair value of the asset impaired. The fair value is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. The results of impairment tests are subject to managements estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results. The Company believes that, based on current conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from long lived asset impairments. However, a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results. Intangible assets and goodwill. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires companies to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). The Company has determined that it has three reporting units and the annual impairment test will be performed as of September 30th. SFAS 142 also requires that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset that has an indefinite life be determined by using a fair value based approach. The valuation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including, but not limited to, projected future revenue and cash flows. The Company believes that, based on current conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from goodwill and intangible impairments. However, a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different report results. Inventory. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory for the aggregates segment on a quarterly basis is based on internal 27 Table of Contents estimates of production during the period. An outside consultant measures the volume of aggregates inventory for our large quarries on a quarterly basis and the balance of the locations primarily on a semi annual basis. Aggregates inventory is adjusted to the amounts shown in the report of the outside consultant. Asset Retirement Obligation. SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and FIN 47; Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, require that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is amortized over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each reporting period through charges to operating expenses. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement. For concrete and terminal locations, asset retirement obligations are recorded for lease stipulated requirements, as well as closure obligations related to storage tanks. For the cement and calcium segment, asset retirement obligations have been provided for obligations to reclaim mining sites, asbestos removal, and closure obligations related to storage tanks. For the aggregates segment, an asset retirement obligation was provided where the Company has a legal obligation to reclaim the mining site and closure obligations related to storage tanks. Assessments, Claims and Litigation. From time to time, the Company is involved with assessments, claims and litigation. The Company uses both in house and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss. The Company establishes an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for remediation efforts are recorded no later than the time a feasibility study is undertaken and the Company commits to a formal plan of action. Additionally, legal fees associated with these matters are accrued at the time such claims are made. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these assessments, claims and litigation will not differ materially from the Company estimates. Employee Benefits. Under the provisions of SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, measurement of the obligations under employee benefits plans are subject to a number of assumptions. These include the rate of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to the value of the liability. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Related Party Transactions. Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (Patriot), a related party through common directors (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), hauls diesel fuel, cement and other supplies for the Company. Charges for such services are based on prevailing market prices. The Company also leases various aggregate mining and other properties paying rent or royalties based on long term contracts entered into during the mid 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, the Company provides administrative services to Patriot. These services are provided at market prices. On October 4, 2006, the Company entered into a 50 50 joint venture with a subsidiary of Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (FRP) to develop property near Brooksville, Florida. We contributed approximately 553 acres of land with a book value of $1,700,000 and FRP contributed approximately 3,433 acres of land which the Company leased from Patriot under a long term mining lease. In addition, we contributed an additional 288 acre parcel that we acquired in 2006, and FRP reimbursed us $3,018,000 for one half of the acquisition costs of that parcel. The Companys investment in the joint venture is $5,136,000 as of September 30, 2007. The Company and FRP are each required to fund up to $2 million each in additional capital contributions. The Company will continue to conduct mining operations on a portion of the property and pay royalties to FRP based on actual tons mined. 28 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements. In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry (EITF 04 6), EITF 04 6 was effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2006 and requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The Company currently accounts for stripping costs consistent with the method prescribed by EITF 04 6, and as such, it did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007 and it is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB ratified EITF No. 06 3, Disclosure Requirements for Taxes Assessed by a Government Authority on Revenue Producing Transactions. EITF 06 3 requires disclosure of a companys accounting policy with respect to presentation of taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in revenue and costs), EITF 06 3 also requires disclosure of the amount of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06 3 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007 and did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company records taxes collected on revenue producing activities on a net basis. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, which prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP AUG AIR 1 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007 and, as the Company does not currently use the prohibited method, is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which requires registrants to consider the effect of all carryover and reversing effects or prior year misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements. The cumulative effective of initial application is to be reported in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year, and the offsetting is to be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year. The provisions of SAB 108 are effective for the Companys fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06 5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4. This issue requires that the determination of the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract (1) consider any additional amounts (beyond cash surrender value) included in the contractual terms of the policy and (2) be based on assumed surrender at the individual policy or certificate level, unless all policies or certificates are required to be surrendered as a group. When it is probable that contractual restrictions would limit the amount that could be realized, such contractual 29 Table of Contents limitations should be considered and any amounts recoverable at the insurance companys discretion should be excluded from the amount that could be realized. EITF 06 5 is effective for the company beginning October 1, 2007 and the Company is in the process of evaluating its impact, if any, on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2008 and the Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of this Statement on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This Statement also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the Companys fiscal year end. SFAS 158 is effective for the Company as of September 30, 2007 (See Note 12), with the exception of the measurement date provisions, which are effective for the Companys fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. Outlook. Residential construction in our markets continues to show significant weakness, with the subprime credit crunch adding additional negative impact. Non residential is still slightly ahead of the prior year but these comparisons will get tougher in the coming months and without any rebound in residential historical precedent would indicate softening in non residential construction as well in the coming months. Highway/infrastructure spending remains strong but will be dependent on continued strength in tax revenues for the states in the coming year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the level of construction activity in the residential sector decreased resulting in a reduction in volumes in all three business segments. The volumes in these segments in fiscal 2007 have continued to be depressed from fiscal 2006 levels. The temporary shutdown of mining ordered by the federal court for our Miami quarry continues in effect while our appeal of that order remains pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile we expect the Army Corps of Engineers to issue the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement ordered by the federal district court in early 2008. For further discussion of the issues surrounding the Miami quarry, refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For our cement segment, construction continues on our expansion with completion now scheduled for late calendar 2008 or early 2009. The decline in residential construction is depressing our volumes in this segment with little expectation of any near term improvement in demand. High shipping costs are holding up the price of cement imports offsetting the pressure on prices in the local Florida market caused by the overall softening of demand. Inflation. In the past five years the Company has been able to raise the price of its core products in amounts that generally offset or exceed inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.

A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Our operations are highly dependent on the interest rate sensitive construction industry. Economic activity in the construction industry in general, and the residential construction market in particular, is adversely affected by rising interest rates and escalating costs. A significant decrease in construction activity in our markets may have a material adverse effect on our sales and net income. Aside from inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are affected by market risk from changes in interest rates. For our cash and cash equivalents, a change in interest rates affects the amount of interest income that can be earned. For our debt instruments changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest expense incurred. The following table provides information about the Companys financial instruments and the maturity dates thereof that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands): There Fair 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 after Total Value Long term debt at fixed rates 264 369 275 86 52 159 1,205 1,253 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 7.2 % 7.1 % Long term debt at variable interest rate 1,775 15,775 17,550 17,550 Weighted average interest rate 4.1 % 32 Table of Contents

Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Overview. The Company is one of the nations leading producers of construction aggregates, a major provider of ready mix concrete and concrete products in the Southeastern and Mid Atlantic States and a significant supplier of cement in Florida and Georgia. We operate through three business segments: construction aggregates, concrete products, and cement and calcium. The construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining, processing, distribution and sale of sand, gravel and crushed stone. The concrete products segment is engaged in production and sale of ready mix concrete, concrete block, prestressed concrete as well as sales of other building materials. The cement and calcium products segment is engaged in the production and sale of Portland and masonry cement, the importation of cement and slag which are either sold or ground or blended and then sold and the sale of calcium products to the animal feed industry. During fiscal 2007, our business was significantly affected by the dramatic downturn in residential construction activity in Florida. For the contribution made to net sales and operating profit from each business segment, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 19, 2007, we agreed to merge with Vulcan Materials Company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 19, 2007. The merger was approved by our shareholders on August 14, 2007, and is expected to close on or about November 16, 2007. Our Business We are a major basic construction materials company concentrating on growth markets in the Southeastern and Mid Atlantic states. We operate in three business segments: construction aggregates, cement and calcium products, and concrete products. Construction Aggregates. Our construction aggregates segment is engaged in the mining, processing, distribution and sale of crushed stone, sand and gravel. Our construction aggregates segment operates plants in multiple states: Crushed Base Rock Sand, Gravel and Distribution Stone Plants Plants Industrial Sand Terminals Florida 3 2 10 3 Georgia 7 3 2 Tennessee 1 Alabama 1 1 Maryland 2 2 4 Delaware 1 Virginia 2 2 2 Illinois 1 Kentucky 1 Louisiana 1 Canada 1 Bahamas 1 Note: Chart includes one joint venture crushed stone plant in Georgia and one joint venture crushed stone plant in Canada. During fiscal 2007 we produced and shipped 36.2 million tons of construction aggregates. Currently, we have 2.1 billion tons of permitted reserves. Concrete Products Segment. Our concrete products segment produces and sells ready mix concrete, concrete block, prestressed and precast concrete and sells other building materials in multiple states: 19 Table of Contents Ready Mix Concrete Concrete Prestress Precast Plants Block Plants Plants Plant Florida 62 12 1 Georgia 10 1 North Carolina 2 Virginia 37 District of Columbia 2 Maryland 6 Bahamas 1 1 In 2007, we had a delivery fleet of 1,276 ready mix and block trucks. Cement and Calcium Products. Our cement and calcium products segment operates a cement plant in Newberry, Florida, import terminals and grinding facilities in Tampa and Port Manatee, Florida and a limestone grinding facility in Brooksville, Florida. Our Newberry cement plant produced 685,000 tons of cement in 2007. Construction to double the annual production capacity of this plant continued in 2007. Construction is expected to be completed in early fiscal 2009. Our Tampa facility imports, blends or bags and sells cement and grinds, blends and sells granulate blast furnace slag. Our Port Manatee facility imports and grinds clinker (unground cement) and sells the ground cement. Our Brooksville facility operates a limestone grinding plant that provides product for the animal feed industry and paint, plastic and joint compound industries. Business Environment Our business principally serves customers in the construction industry. Our business is impacted by a number of factors affecting the construction industry and the economy as a whole. Although a number of different factors, risks and trends affect our business, we have highlighted some of these factors below: Our Markets. Construction activity and general economic conditions in our principal markets significantly affect our results. The following breakdown shows our sales by market: Market 2007 % of Sales 2006 % of Sales Florida 59.8 65.6 Mid Atlantic 30.1 25.7 Georgia 7.5 7.2 North Carolina .3 .4 Tennessee .6 .5 Illinois .6 .5 Kentucky .6 .2 Alabama .5 Construction Activity. Residential construction has declined dramatically in our Florida markets. We cannot estimate when the housing market will turn around and until residential construction recovers, volumes will continue to trail fiscal 2006 volumes. Construction activity in our markets is affected by a number of factors, including population growth, economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. 20 Table of Contents Our financial results also are affected by highway construction spending levels. On August 10, 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act A Legacy for Users became law, providing $286.5 billion in guaranteed funding for federal highway, transit and safety programs. We expect this legislation to result in modest increases in highway construction spending over the next several years. Cement Supplies. In 2004 there was a severe cement shortage in the Florida market. The cement shortage was fueled by a record level of demand, unusual downtime at some of our competitors plants and limited availability of imports due to stronger international demand, particularly in China, and a shortage of available barges. The cement shortage eased in 2005, although many states in our markets experienced somewhat tight supply conditions. Demand for cement products also weakened in late fiscal 2006 as a result of the slowdown in residential construction. During fiscal 2007, the demand continues to weaken as a result of the slowdown in residential construction. During 2007 due to this weak demand, our Newberry cement plant was shutdown for thirty nine days due to lack of storage space for our product. We began construction of an expansion of our Newberry plant in fiscal 2006. Some of our competitors also either are expanding capacity or building new plants. Additional Factors Influencing Operations. Our operations are influenced by a number of other external and internal factors. External factors include weather, competition, interest rates, fuel costs, transportation costs, driver availability, labor costs and inflation. Internal factors include sales mix, plant location, quality and quantities of aggregates reserves, capacity utilization and other operating factors. In October 2005 a hurricane affected southern Florida and caused a disruption of business during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Rail operations were interrupted, resulting in restricted delivery of product to our terminals. This interruption caused a shortage of aggregate production in some parts of Florida which affected business in areas not affected by the hurricane during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Financial results are affected by planned maintenance at the cement plant since these costs, which can be significant, are expensed when incurred. The Company expensed planned maintenance of $3,800,000 in fiscal 2007, as compared to $4,100,000 in fiscal 2006. The plant was shut down for twenty three days in fiscal 2007 and nineteen days in fiscal 2006 for planned maintenance. Planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 at an estimated cost of $2,900,000 as compared to $2,600,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Planned maintenance costs typically result in an overhaul to the wear parts of the major operating components. Since the cement manufacturing process is continuous, the coordination of the repair to multiple components is paramount. Items that typically are inspected, repaired and or replaced during an outage include: chain and belt conveyors, idlers, rollers, mill journals, impact hammers, grinding table liners, separator blades, mill liners, bearings, fans, ductwork, airslides, grinding media, refractory, castable and shell replacement. Our insurance program consists of the Company self insuring a portion of the claims and paying premiums for coverage in excess of this self insurance retention. The self insurance retention level is determined by comparing the premium for the coverage versus the potential exposure. For the automobile insurance programs, self insurance retention is $3,000,000 per occurrence. For workers compensation and general liability insurance programs, the self insurance retention is $1,000,000 per occurrence with an aggregate of $2,000,000 for general liability. Operating Review. Fiscal 2007 sales declined 21.0% to $1,080,774,000 from $1,367,789,000 for fiscal 2006 due to decreased demand in all three business segments. The primary reason for the revenue decline is volume decreases in all three of our business segments due to a significant slow down in construction 21 Table of Contents activity, particularly in the residential markets. In addition, sales prices for cement decreased slightly due to a change in product mix and lower sales price of concrete block. These decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices in our aggregate segment and the higher average selling price of ready mix concrete. In our aggregates segment for the year, volumes at our producing locations were down 19.1% over 2006 volumes, although volume declines were partially offset by a 15.2% increase in the average selling price. Volumes decreased in both our southern and northern operations. In our concrete segment for the year, volumes of ready mix concrete declined 23.1%, while our block volumes were down 44.9% compared to 2006. Sales prices for ready mix concrete increased 5.4% and for concrete block decreased 1.5%. In our cement operations for the year volumes decreased 24.4% and the average selling price of cement declined 0.3%. Fiscal 2006 sales increased 18.6% to $1,367,789,000 from $1,153,452,000 in fiscal 2005 due to increased revenues in all three business segments. These increases were attributable to both increased volumes and sales prices of construction aggregates at producing locations, ready mix concrete, concrete block and building materials, and cement. In our aggregates segment for fiscal 2006, volumes at our producing locations were up 7.0% over 2005 volumes primarily from acquisitions at the end of fiscal 2005 or early fiscal 2006, increased volumes from our quarry on the Ohio River in Illinois acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2005 and from our Georgia and Florida operations. These volume increases were offset by decreases in volumes at our distribution terminals of 4.8% and lower volumes in our Virginia and Maryland markets. In our concrete segment for fiscal 2006, volumes of ready mix concrete were up 3.2%, while our block volumes were down 1.9% compared to 2005. Sales prices for ready mix were up 16.9% and for block were up 19.1%. In our cement operations for fiscal 2006 volumes decreased 2.1% due to lower volumes at our grinding facilities partially offset by increased volumes at the Newberry cement plant. Gross profit for fiscal 2007 decreased 27.4% and gross margin decreased to 29.9% of sales as compared to 32.6% for 2006. We experienced gross profit and gross margin declines in all three business segments due to sales declines. Our business is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed costs. When we experience these levels of decreases in volumes, it will cause a significant decrease in our gross profit margin and gross profit. Construction aggregates declines were primarily due to decreased volumes and higher depreciation expense due to completion of new production facilities and high fixed costs, partially offset by increased prices. The cement and calcium group declines for the year were due to reduced volumes and higher costs. Our concrete products segment for the year declined due to reduced ready mix and block volumes and higher fixed costs partially offset by increased sales prices of ready mix concrete. The cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices. Depreciation expense was approximately $9,743,000 higher, which depressed profit and margin. Gross profit for fiscal 2006 increased 26.9% and gross margin increased to 32.6% of sales as compared to 30.5% for 2005. These increases were due to all three business segments gross profit and gross margin improvements. Construction aggregates improvements were primarily due to higher sales prices and increased volumes. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 benefited from an insurance settlement of 22 Table of Contents $2,116,000 which recovered costs previously expensed. The cement and calcium group improvement for the year was due to price increases partially offset by the reduced volumes. Our concrete products segment for fiscal 2006 improved due to increased sales prices and ready mix volumes. All three segments gross profit and margins were adversely affected by dramatic increases in fuel and energy costs and construction aggregates and concrete products were adversely affected by repairs and maintenance. The cement and concrete products segments were adversely affected by increased raw material prices. Gross profit in fiscal 2005 also benefited from an insurance settlement of $2,116,000 which recovered costs previously expensed. Fuel costs were $14,464,000 higher in 2006 as compared to 2005. Repair costs increased $5,453,000 in fiscal 2006. Higher depreciation expense of approximately $7,425,000 also depressed profit and margin. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses on a consolidated basis decreased 12.8% in 2007. SGA as a percentage of sales were 10.5% for fiscal 2007 as compared to 9.5% for fiscal 2006. The dollar decrease is due to reduced profit sharing and management incentive compensation, which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains, reduced professional services, reduced contributions and reduced risk insurance cost and a general reduction in selling general and administrative costs. These lower expenses were partially offset by $10,062,000 of costs related to our merger with Vulcan. SGA expense decreased in all three business segments primarily due to profit sharing and management incentive. Without these decreased expenses, SGA expenses for each of the business segments would have decreased slightly. For corporate overhead, SGA expenses increased as a result of merger expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses on a consolidated basis increased 20.0% in 2006 compared to 2005. SGA as a percentage of sales were 9.5% for fiscal 2006 as compared to 9.4% for fiscal 2005. The dollar increase is due to profit sharing and management incentive compensation, which are both linked to earnings before income taxes and real estate gains, stock option expense related to the adoption of FAS 123R which increased cost by $5,192,000 and legal services. All three business segments had an increase in SGA expense primarily due to profit sharing, management incentive and stock option expenses. Without these increased expenses, SGA expenses for each of the business segments would have increased slightly. For corporate overhead, SGA expenses increased as a result of higher profit sharing, management incentive, stock option expense and professional fees. In fiscal 2005 SGA expenses benefited $556,000 from reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the insurance settlement discussed above and $596,000 from life insurance proceeds Consolidated operating profit decreased to $214,217,000 in 2007 as compared to $319,475,000 for the same period last year. Gains on the sale of real estate this year were $3,928,000 versus $3,569,000 during fiscal 2006. Operating profit for the year for the aggregates group decreased to $103,246,000 from $117,215,000 last year. This was due to a 19.1% decrease in volume partially offset by price increases. The aggregates group did not have real estate gains in fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,685,000 last year. For the concrete products segment, operating profit decreased to $81,452,000 from $148,149,000 last year. This was due to 23.1% decrease in ready mix volumes and a 44.9% decrease in block volumes, partially offset by price increases. For the cement and calcium segment, operating profit decreased to $55,745,000 from $83,600,000 last year. This decrease is primarily due to reduced volumes. Consolidated operating profit increased to $319,475,000 in 2006 as compared to $249,473,000 in 2005. Fiscal 2005 included the gain on the sale of a former quarry and other real estate which resulted in a gain of $6,367,000. Gains on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2006 were $3,569,000. Operating profit for 2006 for the Aggregates group increased to $117,215,000 from $94,552,000. This was due to a 7.0% increase in volume and price increases slightly offset by higher SGA expense and further reduced by higher fuel and repair costs. The aggregates 23 Table of Contents group had real estate gains of $1,685,000 in 2006 as compared to $6,194,000 in fiscal 2005. For the concrete products segment, operating profit increased to $148,149,000 from $118,161,000 in fiscal 2005. This was due to 3.2% increase in ready mix volumes, price increases and additional real estate gains of $1,711,000. These increases were slightly offset by increased fuel and SGA expenses. For the cement and calcium segment, operating profit increased to $83,600,000 from $57,336,000 in 2005. This increase was due to higher prices, partially offset by increased SGA expenses. Interest expense for 2007 increased to $423,000 from $259,000 in 2006 as a result of interest on non debt obligations. Interest of $1,030,000 was capitalized this year as compared to $898,000 last year. Interest expense for 2006 decreased to $259,000 from $1,555,000 in 2005 as a result of lower debt outstanding on revolving credit agreements and capitalization of interest of $898,000. Interest income for 2007 was $2,701,000 as compared to $3,161,000 last year. The decrease is the result of having less average excess cash available during fiscal 2007 for investment in short term investments. The Company ended the year with approximately $34.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Interest income for 2006 was $3,161,000 as compared to $1,260,000 in 2005. Fiscal year 2005s interest income included $604,000 of interest income on the insurance settlement discussed above. The increase was the result of having more excess cash available during fiscal 2006 for investment in short term investments. During fiscal 2006, the Company had very little usage of its revolving credit facilities. The Company ended the year with approximately $93 million of excess cash. Other income decreased $6,270,000 from last year primarily from gains on sale of other assets last year and lower equity in affiliates. Other income for 2006 includes a gain from an exchange of real estate which resulted from a legal settlement of $2,838,000. Also included in other income in fiscal 2006 is a gain of $1,442,000 from the sale of a 15% interest in an affiliate. Included in other income is our 50% equity in the operating results of our joint ventures. During fiscal 2007 this equity in earnings of joint ventures was a loss of $380,000 as compared to $810,000 last year. This loss is the result of reduced volumes. Income tax expense decreased to $76,916,000 in 2007 as compared to $118,675,000 last year. This is due to lower income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 35.3% versus 36.0% last year. Income tax expense increased to $118,675,000 in 2006 as compared to $97,979,000 in 2005. This is due to higher income before taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 36.0% versus 37.4% last year. The decrease in effective income tax rate is due to the 3% manufacturers credit in fiscal 2006 and an increase in excess percentage depletion as a result of increased revenues. Net earnings for fiscal 2007 were $141,016,000 as compared to $211,409,000 last year. Included in net earnings for this year is the gain on the sale of real estate of $3,928,000 pre tax ($2,541,000 after tax). Included in fiscal 2006 was the gain on the sale of real estate of $3,569,000 ($2,284,000 after tax) and a gain of $2,838,000 pretax from the exchange of real estate ($1,816,000 after tax). Liquidity and Capital Resources. The following key financial measurements reflect the Companys financial position and capital resources at September 30 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,876 93,353 68,921 Total debt $ 20,031 19,702 19,934 Current ratio 1.8 to 1 2.0 to 1 1.8 to 1 Debt as a percent of capital employed 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Unused revolving credit $ 250,000 250,000 250,000 Unused short term lines $ 35,000 35,000 35,000 24 Table of Contents In 2007, cash provided by operations of $206,599,000, sales of assets of $12,613,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $15,721,000 were used to purchase $241,352,000 of property, plant and equipment, for business acquisitions of $30,727,000 and to pay dividends of $29,691,000. In 2006, cash provided by operations of $291,719,000, sales of assets of $9,384,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3,949,000 were used to purchase $158,929,000 of property, plant and equipment, for business acquisitions of $44,030,000, to repurchase stock of $19,898,000 and to pay dividends of $49,197,000. Operating Activities: During fiscal 2007, cash flow provided by operations was $206,599,000. The major reason for the decrease from 2006 was decreased earnings, a decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses partially offset by a decrease in inventory, an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in depreciation and amortization. During fiscal 2006, cash flow provided by operations was $291,719,000. The major reason for the increase from 2005 was increased earnings, an increase in depreciation and amortization, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory. Investing Activities: Cash flow used for investing activities was $267,432,000 for fiscal 2007. This resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $241,352,000 and $30,727,000 used for business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets of $12,613,000. Cash flow used in investing activities was $205,946,000 for fiscal 2006. This resulted from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $158,929,000 and $44,030,000 used for business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other assets of $9,384,000. Financing Activities: Cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,356,000 in fiscal 2007. The exercise of stock options provided $15,721,000 of funds and the tax benefit related to these exercises provided $31,986,000 of funds. Payment of dividends used $29,691,000 of funds. Cash flow used for financing activities was $61,341,000 in fiscal 2006. During the year, dividends of $49,197,000 were paid and $19,898,000 of common stock was repurchased. The merger with Vulcan is expected to close on November 16, 2007. Future capital expenditures will be determined based on the combined companies future capital expenditure plans. The Company expects that the Purchase and Put Agreements covering $3,550,000 of the Industrial Revenue Bonds (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) will continue to be amended until the earlier of the final maturity date of the respective bonds or until the project financed by the bonds is terminated. To the extent that the bonds mature or the Purchase and Put Agreements are not extended, the Company will repurchase and or repay the bonds with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. The Company believes it will be able to renegotiate its present credit facilities or obtain similar replacement credit facilities when necessary in the future. 25 Table of Contents Capital Resources: Working capital for fiscal 2007 decreased to $109,894,000 from $153,925,000 for fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to decreased cash from operations. Working capital for fiscal 2006 increased to $153,925,000 from $121,545,000 for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to increased cash from operations. Upon completion of the merger with Vulcan, the Companys revolving credit facilities will be terminated and future funding will be provided by Vulcan credit facilities. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations, maturities and commitments. See Notes 8 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long term debt and operating leases.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. There are no off balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, and in some cases, actuarial calculations. We constantly review these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from estimated results determined using the factors described above. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides detail on the application of these and other accounting policies. These critical accounting policies and Note 2 should be read in conjunction with this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 26 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of the accounting policies considered to be most critical to the Company. These accounting policies are both most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has reviewed this disclosure regarding Critical Accounting Estimates. Self insurance reserves. It is our policy to self insure for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers compensation, comprehensive general liability, product liability and auto liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Based on an independent actuarys estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and adjusted monthly. The actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources, including changes in claim reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although the Company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the Companys self insurance obligations and future expense. Long lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. An impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net carrying value over the fair value of the asset impaired. The fair value is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. The results of impairment tests are subject to managements estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results. The Company believes that, based on current conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from long lived asset impairments. However, a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results. Intangible assets and goodwill. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires companies to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). The Company has determined that it has three reporting units and the annual impairment test will be performed as of September 30th. SFAS 142 also requires that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset that has an indefinite life be determined by using a fair value based approach. The valuation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including, but not limited to, projected future revenue and cash flows. The Company believes that, based on current conditions, materially different reported results are not likely to result from goodwill and intangible impairments. However, a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different report results. Inventory. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory for the aggregates segment on a quarterly basis is based on internal 27 Table of Contents estimates of production during the period. An outside consultant measures the volume of aggregates inventory for our large quarries on a quarterly basis and the balance of the locations primarily on a semi annual basis. Aggregates inventory is adjusted to the amounts shown in the report of the outside consultant. Asset Retirement Obligation. SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and FIN 47; Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, require that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is amortized over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each reporting period through charges to operating expenses. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement. For concrete and terminal locations, asset retirement obligations are recorded for lease stipulated requirements, as well as closure obligations related to storage tanks. For the cement and calcium segment, asset retirement obligations have been provided for obligations to reclaim mining sites, asbestos removal, and closure obligations related to storage tanks. For the aggregates segment, an asset retirement obligation was provided where the Company has a legal obligation to reclaim the mining site and closure obligations related to storage tanks. Assessments, Claims and Litigation. From time to time, the Company is involved with assessments, claims and litigation. The Company uses both in house and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss. The Company establishes an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for remediation efforts are recorded no later than the time a feasibility study is undertaken and the Company commits to a formal plan of action. Additionally, legal fees associated with these matters are accrued at the time such claims are made. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these assessments, claims and litigation will not differ materially from the Company estimates. Employee Benefits. Under the provisions of SFAS No.87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, measurement of the obligations under employee benefits plans are subject to a number of assumptions. These include the rate of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to the value of the liability. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Related Party Transactions. Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (Patriot), a related party through common directors (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), hauls diesel fuel, cement and other supplies for the Company. Charges for such services are based on prevailing market prices. The Company also leases various aggregate mining and other properties paying rent or royalties based on long term contracts entered into during the mid 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, the Company provides administrative services to Patriot. These services are provided at market prices. On October 4, 2006, the Company entered into a 50 50 joint venture with a subsidiary of Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. (FRP) to develop property near Brooksville, Florida. We contributed approximately 553 acres of land with a book value of $1,700,000 and FRP contributed approximately 3,433 acres of land which the Company leased from Patriot under a long term mining lease. In addition, we contributed an additional 288 acre parcel that we acquired in 2006, and FRP reimbursed us $3,018,000 for one half of the acquisition costs of that parcel. The Companys investment in the joint venture is $5,136,000 as of September 30, 2007. The Company and FRP are each required to fund up to $2 million each in additional capital contributions. The Company will continue to conduct mining operations on a portion of the property and pay royalties to FRP based on actual tons mined. 28 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements. In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry (EITF 04 6), EITF 04 6 was effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2006 and requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. The Company currently accounts for stripping costs consistent with the method prescribed by EITF 04 6, and as such, it did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007 and it is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB ratified EITF No. 06 3, Disclosure Requirements for Taxes Assessed by a Government Authority on Revenue Producing Transactions. EITF 06 3 requires disclosure of a companys accounting policy with respect to presentation of taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in revenue and costs), EITF 06 3 also requires disclosure of the amount of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06 3 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007 and did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company records taxes collected on revenue producing activities on a net basis. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, which prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities. FSP AUG AIR 1 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2007 and, as the Company does not currently use the prohibited method, is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which requires registrants to consider the effect of all carryover and reversing effects or prior year misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements. The cumulative effective of initial application is to be reported in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that fiscal year, and the offsetting is to be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that year. The provisions of SAB 108 are effective for the Companys fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06 5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4. This issue requires that the determination of the amount that could be realized under an insurance contract (1) consider any additional amounts (beyond cash surrender value) included in the contractual terms of the policy and (2) be based on assumed surrender at the individual policy or certificate level, unless all policies or certificates are required to be surrendered as a group. When it is probable that contractual restrictions would limit the amount that could be realized, such contractual 29 Table of Contents limitations should be considered and any amounts recoverable at the insurance companys discretion should be excluded from the amount that could be realized. EITF 06 5 is effective for the company beginning October 1, 2007 and the Company is in the process of evaluating its impact, if any, on the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2008 and the Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of this Statement on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). This Statement requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This Statement also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the Companys fiscal year end. SFAS 158 is effective for the Company as of September 30, 2007 (See Note 12), with the exception of the measurement date provisions, which are effective for the Companys fiscal year ending September 30, 2009. Outlook. Residential construction in our markets continues to show significant weakness, with the subprime credit crunch adding additional negative impact. Non residential is still slightly ahead of the prior year but these comparisons will get tougher in the coming months and without any rebound in residential historical precedent would indicate softening in non residential construction as well in the coming months. Highway/infrastructure spending remains strong but will be dependent on continued strength in tax revenues for the states in the coming year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 the level of construction activity in the residential sector decreased resulting in a reduction in volumes in all three business segments. The volumes in these segments in fiscal 2007 have continued to be depressed from fiscal 2006 levels. The temporary shutdown of mining ordered by the federal court for our Miami quarry continues in effect while our appeal of that order remains pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile we expect the Army Corps of Engineers to issue the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement ordered by the federal district court in early 2008. For further discussion of the issues surrounding the Miami quarry, refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For our cement segment, construction continues on our expansion with completion now scheduled for late calendar 2008 or early 2009. The decline in residential construction is depressing our volumes in this segment with little expectation of any near term improvement in demand. High shipping costs are holding up the price of cement imports offsetting the pressure on prices in the local Florida market caused by the overall softening of demand. Inflation. In the past five years the Company has been able to raise the price of its core products in amounts that generally offset or exceed inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Forward Looking Statements. Certain matters discussed in this report contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward 30 Table of Contents looking statements. These forward looking statements relate to, among other things, capital expenditures, liquidity, capital resources, and competition and may be indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate, estimate, plans, project, continuing, ongoing, expects, contemplates, management believes, the Company believes, the Company intends, and similar words or phrases. The following factors are among the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements: availability and terms of financing; the weather; competition; levels of construction activity in the Companys markets; cement shipments; fuel and electric costs; transportation costs; inflation; quality and quantities of the Companys aggregates reserves; residential and nonresidential construction; public spending for federal highways and infrastructure; governmental regulations; ocean shipping rates; and managements ability to determine appropriate sales mix, plant location and capacity utilization. However, this list is not a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. These forward looking statements are made as of the date hereof based on managements current expectations and the Company does not undertake, and affirmatively disclaims, an obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional information regarding these and other risks factors may be found in the Companys other filings made from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 31 Table of Contents Item 7. A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Our operations are highly dependent on the interest rate sensitive construction industry. Economic activity in the construction industry in general, and the residential construction market in particular, is adversely affected by rising interest rates and escalating costs. A significant decrease in construction activity in our markets may have a material adverse effect on our sales and net income. Aside from inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are affected by market risk from changes in interest rates. For our cash and cash equivalents, a change in interest rates affects the amount of interest income that can be earned. For our debt instruments changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest expense incurred. The following table provides information about the Companys financial instruments and the maturity dates thereof that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands): There Fair 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 after Total Value Long term debt at fixed rates 264 369 275 86 52 159 1,205 1,253 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 7.2 % 7.1 % Long term debt at variable interest rate 1,775 15,775 17,550 17,550 Weighted average interest rate 4.1 % 32 Table of Contents
