Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis Results of Operations. Income Statement Performance Ratios The following operating ratios are used to measure our performance, not only period to period, but as a common comparison tool against our peers in the marketplace, and is useful in understanding our profitability. The three most common ratios follow: Loss and LAE ratio The result of dividing net losses and LAE incurred by net premiums earned. It is a measure of the percentage of our premium revenue that goes towards investigating and settling claims. Underwriting expense ratio The result of dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses by net premiums earned. It is a measure of how efficiently we attract, acquire, and service the business we write. Combined ratio The sum of the loss and LAE ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. This ratio measures a companys overall underwriting profitability. If the combined ratio is at or above 100, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income (and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient). For example, one of our long term financial goals as a Company is to maintain a combined ratio of 96% or less. This means that for every $1.00 of premium that we earn, we will incur $0.96 or less in related costs. The $0.04 margin is referred to as our underwriting profit and, when coupled with our investment results, other income and other expenses, becomes our pre tax income. As noted above, underwriting profit (loss) is not a GAAP measure. 6 Table of Contents Types and Limits of Insurance Coverage The following coverages are generally made available on our private passenger auto insurance contract: bodily injury liability; property damage; medical payments; personal injury protection, uninsured and underinsured motorist; rental reimbursement; uninsured motorist property damage; towing; comprehensive; and collision. All of these policies are written for a six month term except for Involuntary Market policies assigned to us, which are for twelve months. Minimum levels of bodily injury and property damage are required by state law and typically cover the other partys claims when our policyholder is at fault. Uninsured and underinsured motorist typically are optional coverages and cover our policyholder when the other party is at fault and has insufficient liability insurance to cover the insureds injuries and loss of income. Comprehensive and collision coverages are also optional and cover damage to the policyholders automobile whether or not the insured is at fault. Medical payments coverage typically is optional. In some states, we are required to offer personal injury protection coverage. Various limits of liability are underwritten with maximum limits of $500,000 per person and $500,000 per accident. Our most popular bodily injury liability limits are $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. Our personal umbrella policy (PUP) is written with a twelve month policy term with liability coverage limits of $1 million to $5 million in excess of the underlying automobile liability coverage we write. Since May 2002, we have required minimum underlying automobile limits, written by us, of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident for PUP policies sold. We reinsure 90% of any PUP loss.

Direct premiums written outside of California comprised 2.4% of total direct premiums written in 2003, and have increased to 11.3% of total premiums written in 2006 as a result of our geographic expansion efforts. 1 Includes motorcycle. 2 Includes $0.1 million and $2.4 million of homeowner and earthquake direct premiums written in 2003 and 2002, respectively. We no longer have any homeowner policies in force. We ceased writing earthquake coverage in 1994, but we had remaining loss reserves from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. See further discussion in Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Table of Contents The following timeline of our geographic expansion efforts describes our transformation from a business that operated in 18 percent of the market in 2003 to a national competitor that operates in 60 percent of the market in 2006: First quarter of 2004 added eight percent of the market when we began writing personal auto policies in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Third quarter of 2004 opened a service center in Dallas, diversifying our call center operations. First quarter of 2005 added seven percent of the market when we began writing personal auto policies in Texas. Second quarter of 2006 added 15 percent of the market when we began writing personal auto policies in Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Fourth quarter of 2006 added eleven percent of the market when we began writing personal auto policies in New Jersey, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Summary of California Distribution The table below summarizes the concentrations within California of our vehicles in force for the personal auto lines, excluding Involuntary Market policies and personal umbrella and motorcycle coverages as of the end of each of the past five years. December 31, 2005 data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (the most recent available) indicates that 22.5% of its registrations were for vehicles in Los Angeles County. Primarily as a result of our growth in other areas of California, our concentration of Los Angeles County vehicles insured has declined from 37.2% in 2002 to 27.8% at the end of 2006, approaching a natural distribution of business in the state.

The underwriting process occurs at the inception of the policy, whenever a change is requested and at renewal. In certain circumstances, we will non renew a policy due to a substantial increase in risk. We have developed a highly segmented and sophisticated pricing model that is one of the best pricing models in the industry. Through a combination of rating variables and interactions among variables, we believe we are able to achieve higher levels of pricing accuracy than have historically been employed. This model, which we employ in active markets outside of California, allows us to grow by out segmenting established competitors while providing greater stability in our results. Our objective is to offer a price that, to the fullest extent possible, reflects the loss and expense expectations for every customer. Accurate pricing is important because it rewards and encourages safe driving and increases stability in our results, reducing the impact of mix changes in our book of business. California We are required to offer insurance to any California applicant who meets the California statutory definition of a good driver. This definition includes, but is not limited to, all drivers licensed during the previous three years with no more than one violation point count under criteria contained in the California Vehicle Code. These criteria include a variety of moving violations and certain at fault accidents. California law defines the primary rating characteristics that must be used for California automobile policies and include driving record (e.g., history of accidents and moving violations), annual mileage and number of years the driver has been licensed. A number of other optional rating factors are also permitted and used in California, which include characteristics such as make and model of automobile, policy limits and deductibles, and gender and marital status. 3 Includes the following counties: Imperial, Kern, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino and Ventura. 4 Includes all California counties other than Los Angeles County, San Diego County, and those specified above in Footnote 3. 8 Table of Contents The regulatory system in California requires the prior approval of insurance rates. Within the regulatory framework, we establish our premium rates based primarily on actuarial analyses of our own historical loss and expense data. This data is compiled and analyzed to establish overall rate levels as well as classification differentials. Our rates are established at levels intended to generate underwriting profits and vary for individual policies based on a number of rating characteristics. These rates are a blend of base rates and class plan filings made with the California Department of Insurance (CDI). Base rates are the primary amount projected to generate an adequate underwriting profit. Class plan changes are filings that serve to modify the factors that impact the base rates so that each individual receives a rate, to the extent permitted by regulation, that reflects their respective risk to losses and expenses. Class plan changes are intended to be revenue neutral to us. In July 2006, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating (the Auto Rating Factor Regulations). The new rules required automobile insurance companies to make a class plan and rate filing during the third quarter of 2006 to bring their automobile insurance rates in California into compliance with the Auto Rating Factor Regulations. Litigation to preliminarily enjoin the implementation of the Auto Rating Factor Regulations and have them declared in violation of California law has been unsuccessful. As a result, the Company submitted class plan and rate filings to the CDI for its review. The Companys rate filing proposed an overall rate decrease of 5% of premium. The CDI approved the Companys class plan and rate filings. The new rates took effect January 3, 2007. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations (the Rate Approval Regulations) that would determine how insurance rates for personal auto and most other lines of personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business are established in California. In October 2006, the CDI issued additional amendments to the Rate Approval Regulations. These regulations were submitted in November 2006 to the Office of Administrative Law (the OAL) and were approved in January of 2007. The amended regulations will become effective on April 3, 2007. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information regarding these regulations. Marketing Our marketing and underwriting strategy is to appeal to careful and responsible drivers who desire a feature rich product at a competitive price. We use direct mail, broadcast and print media, outdoor, community events and the Internet to generate inbound telephone calls, which are served by company employees who are licensed insurance agents. Because our centralized operations are company staffed in two major locations, we can deliver a highly efficient and professional experience to our callers 24 hours per day, 365 days per year through a convenient, toll free 800 211 SAVE telephone number. Consumers may also obtain an auto rate quotation and purchase a policy on our web site at www.21st.com. According to data published in the 2006 Nielsen Universe Estimates, 73% of all Spanish speaking residents in the United States live in the following states that we write business: California, Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We offer full customer service, including policy purchase, in Spanish via our web site and bilingual professionals 24 hours per day, 365 days per year through a dedicated toll free telephone number at 888 920 2121. Additionally, we utilize Spanish language advertising and marketing materials. The following table summarizes advertising expenditures and new policies written for the past five years: AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT POLICY DATA Advertising Expenditures and New Policies Written Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Total advertising expenditures $ 74.9 $ 70.1 $ 66.7 $ 53.9 $ 43.3 New policies written 172,899 170,224 225,349 265,589 189,652 Customer Service We offer policy support for our customers directly with our own licensed professionals. We operate 24/7/365 and provide service in both English and Spanish. Customers contact us through their method of choice phone call, interactive voice response, mail, email, or web site. A full service, bilingual web site includes options to buy a policy, pay a bill, make a policy change, or report a claim. Our goal is accurate, prompt, comprehensive and enthusiastic customer service, and we strive for superior customer retention. To maximize efficiencies, 21st Century Insurance links its multiple call centers into one virtual resource. APS is our state of the art, real time policy service system. We completed the APS conversion of our California 21st Century Insurance auto policies during 2005, utilized APS for all of our 2006 market entries, and plan to convert our other personal auto policies to APS in 2007. 9 Table of Contents Claims It is the mission of our claims operation to settle claims fairly and promptly while fully complying with all applicable laws and regulations. We recognize that it is important to support not only our customers financial recovery from an accident, but also their emotional recovery from an unpleasant and disruptive accident experience. The task of delivering on the claims promise to our customers is a challenging one, particularly in todays legal and regulatory environment. Of the thousands of new claims reported weekly, involving automobile thefts, traffic accidents, or other types of damages or injuries, each one entails relating on an empathetic level with a person suffering a loss who deserves individual attention. Yet our adjusters at the same time must remain objective and focused on the activity necessary to investigate the facts of the loss and determine the resulting damages. In every case, acting promptly to resolve the claim while treating people fairly is the way we keep lawsuits to a minimum, especially while faced with demanding claimants and their attorneys. The claim operation functions within the bounds of an ever expanding field of insurance regulations, which were put in place to protect the public and ensure fairness. The task is made more difficult by the incidence of insurance fraud and padding of claims committed by a small percentage of claimants and unscrupulous attorneys, medical providers and the like. A study released by the Insurance Research Council in January 2006, for example, states that 22% of all claims for bodily injury arising from automobile accidents in California involve elements of fraud or buildup. So, while we wish to see that legitimate claims are fairly and quickly paid, it is also important that our adjusters be vigilant to recognize and investigate suspicious claims. The handling of claims is the subject of regulation by the States. Extensive civil case law also exists on most issues covered by insurance. Laws and regulations vary from state to state, with new laws and regulations added every year. It is the adjusters job to investigate and make fair determinations of liability under the law while resolving the claim in compliance with regulations. Adjusters must be trained and knowledgeable to be able to comply with the requirements that affect their handling of each claim. We could not face these challenges without attracting and retaining outstanding professionals through careful hiring practices and one of the most comprehensive adjuster training programs in the industry. Through retention of quality people, we have a very seasoned management staff and an average tenure in the claims area of over nine years. The adjustment of claims is an involved process requiring the coordination of many tasks. The claim operation is charged with confirming coverage for the type of loss, investigating liability to determine responsibility for the accident, assessing damages resulting from the loss, and negotiating a fair resolution. For our products to remain competitive and affordable, claim settlements must be fair and legitimate, and the design of our claim process must operate efficiently and in a cost effective manner. Our claim process is designed to deliver what customers expect: friendly, convenient and efficient service. Reports of accidents are taken by telephone or over the web at www.21st.com. Our claim call centers operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and can assist customers in Spanish as well as in English. Translation services for other languages are readily available to our staff. The report is digitally recorded with the customers permission, which means in most cases the customer need only describe the accident to us one time. A variety of inspection and car repair options are offered to the customer to suit their particular needs. At the conclusion of the claim report, an assignment is routed electronically to inspect the vehicle at a location of the customers choosing, or to dispatch a tow truck to bring a heavily damaged vehicle to one of our Vehicle Inspection Centers. Mobile inspection and repair services are available for minor damage. Our Direct Repair Program (DRP) is a particularly easy way to get repairs done, chosen by about 30% of our customers. The DRP is a carefully selected network of 278 repair shops that meet our high standards for service, work quality, equipment and training. DRPs guarantee their repairs for as long as the claimant owns their vehicle. Repairs at a DRP shop are scheduled electronically and managed by the shop. Quality of the repairs and accuracy of the repair invoice is closely monitored by a thorough re inspection program by our staff who regularly visit the DRP shops and re inspect 39% of the vehicles in various stages of the repair process. By integrating technology with personalized service, one call to 21st is all that is necessary to expedite an automobile damage claim. At the center of our claim handling operation is our new claim system known as APS. Deployed in August of 2004, APS has been used for all auto claims reported since that time, and over 97% of the Companys pending claims are now on the new system. Claims are automatically assigned to adjusters by the type of claim and handling required. Our adjusters work in specialized areas that include liability and damages investigations, material damage estimating, total loss evaluations, litigation and subrogation. With APS, information is available seamlessly to each of these specialties at all times. For example, an adjuster assigned to contact the parties and investigate liability for an accident will view the repair estimate and digital photos taken by the adjuster in the field. Documents received in the mail such as medical bills or obtained over the web such as police reports are scanned into the electronic claim file. This allows more than one person to work on different aspects of the claim at the same time, communicate with each other and, more importantly, with the customer, about the claim. APS enables any adjuster in any of our locations to provide service on any claim regardless of where it occurred, reducing the need to maintain staff in every geographic territory. Litigation can result when disputes of fact or damage arise among the people involved in an accident, and when they remain unresolved after discussion and negotiation. Claim litigation usually involves personal injury claims made by third parties against our insureds. It may also entail the arbitration of uninsured/underinsured motorist claims by insureds. By providing a legal defense of the policyholder faced with a lawsuit, we deliver another very important part of the insurance promise. In California, our house counsel handle the vast majority of this litigation. Cases involving conflict or special circumstances may be assigned to outside defense attorneys. Outside counsel are also used in states other than California. 10 Table of Contents We maintain a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to investigate claims of a suspicious nature. The SIU is also responsible for providing training to claims and other employees on fraud detection. The SIU works closely with members of law enforcement, the Department of Insurance and the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Our SIU is highly regarded in the insurance industry and is known as being very effective in its efforts to detect and deter fraud. 21st settles heavily damaged vehicle claims as total losses where warranted. As a part of the settlement we may take title to the totaled vehicle and sell it as salvage. An outside salvage company conducts the auction and forwards these recovery proceeds, less their fee, to 21st. Vehicles so severely damaged as to have no salvage value are crushed to prevent the VIN from being used for fraudulent purposes. We have team members who specialize in subrogation, or the recovery of monies we have paid on claims where a third party is legally responsible. We also aim to recover the deductible for our insureds. Some collection efforts, particularly those against uninsured motorists, are outsourced to a collection vendor in exchange for a contingency fee upon successful collection. We understand that the claim experience is a moment of truth for the customer and the customers decision to continue a relationship with us depends on that experience. We believe we deliver high quality claim service and we continuously seek improvements in our processes. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The cost to settle a customers claim includes two major components: losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE). Losses in connection with third party coverages represent damages as a result of an insureds act that results in property damage or bodily injury. First party losses involve damage or injury to the insureds property or person. In either case, the ultimate cost of the loss is not always immediately known and, over time, may be higher or lower than initially estimated. When establishing initial and subsequent estimates, the amount of loss is reduced for salvage (e.g., proceeds from the disposal of the wrecked automobile) and subrogation (e.g., proceeds from another party who is fully or partially liable, such as the insurer of the driver who caused the accident involving one of our policyholders). Loss adjustment expenses represent the costs of adjusting, investigating and settling claims, and are primarily comprised of the cost of our claims department, external inspection services, and internal and external legal counsel. Corporate support areas such as Human Resources and Information Technology provide services to our overall operations, and, accordingly, a portion of their operational costs are also allocated to LAE. The LAE allocable portion of such corporate support cost is reviewed periodically as changes occur in our organization. Accounting for losses and LAE is highly subjective because these costs must be estimated often weeks, months or even years in advance of when the payments are actually made to claimants, attorneys, claims personnel and others involved in the claims settlement process. Accounting principles require insurers to record estimates for losses and LAE in the periods in which the insured events, such as automobile accidents, occur. This estimation process requires us to estimate both the number of accidents that have occurred (called frequency) and the ultimate amount of loss and LAE (called severity) related to each accident. We employ actuaries who are professionally trained and certified in the process of establishing estimates for frequency and severity. Historically, our actuaries have not projected a range around the carried reserves for losses and LAE. Rather, they have used several methods and different underlying assumptions to produce a number of point estimates for the required reserves. Management carefully reviews the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the various indicated loss and LAE ratios, and selects the ultimate loss and LAE ratios and the carried reserves. Estimating the Frequency of Auto Accidents. Actuaries study the historical lag between the actual date of loss and the date that the accident is reported by the customer to the claims department, and can make a reasonable, yet never perfect, estimate for frequency, or the number of claims that ultimately will be reported for a given period. The difference between the estimated ultimate number of claims that will be made and the number that have actually been reported in any given period is referred to as incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. Estimating the Severity of Auto Claims. For both property damage and injury claims our adjusters determine what exposures exist in open reserves. All property damage claims and injury claims estimated to be less than $15,000 are set at average amounts determined by our actuaries. For both bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims estimated to have value in excess of $15,000, adjusters in our claims department establish loss estimates based upon various factors such as the extent of the injuries, property damage sustained, and the age of the claim. Our actuaries review these estimates, giving consideration to the adjusters historical ability to accurately estimate the ultimate claim and length of time it will take to settle the claim, and provide for development in the adjusters estimates as applicable. Generally, the longer it takes to settle a claim, the higher the ultimate claim cost. The ultimate amount of the loss is considered the severity of the claim. In addition, the actuaries estimate the severity of the IBNR claims. 11 Table of Contents The severities are estimated by our actuaries quarterly based on historical studies of average claim payments and the patterns of how the claims were paid. Again, the fundamental assumption used in making these estimates is that past events are reliable indicators of future outcomes. Estimating Losses and LAE for Lines in Runoff. Homeowners and earthquake lines are in runoff because we no longer have policies in force. As discussed in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have not written any earthquake policies since 1994 and we ceased writing homeowners coverage at the beginning of 2002. The Company has no open earthquake cases and only immaterial reserves remaining at December 31, 2006. In prior years, developing reserve estimates for the earthquake line was particularly subjective because most of the remaining earthquake claims were in litigation. Loss and LAE Reserve Development Management believes that our reserves are adequate and represent our best estimate based on the information currently available. However, because reserve estimates are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable in the property and casualty insurance business. These changes sometimes are referred to as loss development or reserve development. See Critical Accounting Estimates Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for an explanation of our reserve estimating process. For the personal auto lines, our actuaries prepare a quarterly evaluation of loss and LAE indications by accident month, and based on these evaluations, we assess whether there is a need to adjust reserve estimates. As claims are reported and settled and as other new information becomes available, changes in estimates are made and are included in earnings of the period of the change. The losses and LAE incurred, net of reinsurance, attributable to prior accident years, that we recorded in each of the past five calendar years, are summarized below: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Losses and LAE Incurred, Net of Reinsurance, Attributable to Prior Accident Years Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Personal auto $ (52,648 ) $ (27,473 ) $ (2,936 ) $ 11,159 $ 16,200 Homeowner and earthquake5 751 2,333 2,831 40,048 56,158 Total $ (51,897 ) $ (25,140 ) $ (105 ) $ 51,207 $ 72,358 Bracketed amounts represent redundancies, while unbracketed amounts represent deficiencies in prior year loss and LAE reserves. To understand the changes in estimates, it is useful to put them in the context of the cumulative reserve development experienced by the Company over a longer time frame. The tables on the following pages present the development of loss and LAE reserves for the personal auto lines (Table 1) and for the homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff (Table 2), for the years 1996 through 2006. The figures in both tables are shown gross of reinsurance. In Tables 1 and 2 on the following pages, a redundancy (deficiency) exists when the original reserve estimate is greater (less) than the re estimated reserves. Each amount in the tables includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. The tables do not present accident year or policy year development data. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies based on the table. A detailed discussion of loss and LAE reserve development follows the tables. The top line of each table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the years indicated. The upper portion of the table indicates the cumulative amounts paid as of subsequent year ends with respect to that reserve liability. The lower portion of the table indicates the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year, including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year. The estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. 5 We no longer have any homeowner policies in force. We ceased writing earthquake coverage in 1994, but we had remaining loss reserves from the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Since 2003, there has been favorable development. The period from 1993 to 1999 was quite unusual in that, during that time, we experienced declining frequencies and declining severities in our auto line. As Table 1 shows, we did not immediately have confidence in these declining trends and did not immediately lower our reserve estimates. Much of the decline in trend occurred between 1996 and 1999 because of moderation in health care costs due to greater use of HMOs, and laws that were enacted in California that limited the ability of uninsured motorists and drunk drivers to collect non economic damages. During 1999, we assumed that the past trend of declining frequencies and severities would continue. However, in retrospect, it can now be seen that the favorable decline in trends ended and loss costs began to increase. In 2000, we continued to assume lower loss severity primarily because of what then seemed to be an acceleration in the pattern of claims payments and the uncertainty inherent in identifying a change in multi year patterns. In 2001, we experienced significant, unexpected development in our uninsured motorist coverage while the actuarial indications for most prior accident years were adjusted upward as more data became available. The changes in injury trends affected the entire California market and occurred, to a greater or lesser degree, in virtually every state in the country. Starting in 2001, we improved the quality and timeliness of the data available to make initial estimates and periodic changes in estimates. We have dedicated more resources to better understand the underlying drivers of the changes in frequency and severity trends as they begin emerging. For example, in the second quarter of 2003 we began making accident month actuarial analyses of our reserves for the auto lines. Our improved methodology is reflected in the small favorable development recorded since 2004 with respect to prior accident years and larger favorable developments of $27.5 million in 2005 and $52.6 million in 2006. Homeowner and Earthquake Lines in Runoff During 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company recorded losses related to Senate Bill 1899 (SB 1899) for $0.1 million, $0.4 million, $2.2 million, $37.0 million, $52.6 million, and $70.0 million, respectively. The information below explains historical earthquake developments for which the Company no longer has any significant exposure. In Table 2, substantially all of the development relates to the earthquake line. A major earthquake occurred on January 17, 1994, centered in the San Fernando Valley community of Northridge (the Northridge earthquake). Through December 31, 2006, we have settled over 46,000 Northridge earthquake claims (including auto claims) at a total cost (i.e., loss plus LAE) of over $1.2 billion. The loss development in Table 2 is easiest to understand by dividing it into pre SB 1899 and post SB 1899 segments. In September 2000, the State of California enacted SB 1899, which allowed claims from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, barred by contract and the statute of limitations, to be reopened during calendar year 2001. The costs relating to the reopened claims are a 1994 event (since they all related to the Northridge earthquake), even though the legislation allowing the re opening of certain claims was not passed until almost seven years later. Before SB 1899 was passed in late 2000, we had only approximately 50 earthquake claims remaining to be resolved out of an initial 35,000 homeowner earthquake claims. Although we settled 98% of the claims within a year of the earthquake, many upward changes in estimates were required in 1994 and beyond as new information emerged on the severity of the damages and as settlements of litigated claims occurred. As a result, we recorded the following upward changes in loss estimates after 1994, but before SB 1899 was adopted: 1995 $57 million; 1996 $40 million; 1997 $24.8 million; 1998 $40 million; 1999 $2.5 million; and 2000 $3.5 million. Calendar year 2001 was the one year window SB 1899 permitted for claimants to bring additional insurance claims and legal actions allegedly arising out of the Northridge earthquake. Prior to the enactment of this law, such claims were considered by previously applicable law to be fully barred, or settled and closed. Any additional legal actions with respect to such claims were barred under the policy contracts, settlement agreements, and or applicable statutes of limitation. As a result of the enactment of this unprecedented legislation, claimants asserted additional claims against the Company allegedly related to damages that occurred in the Northridge earthquake, but which were now being reported seven years later in 2001. Plaintiff attorneys and public adjusters conducted extensive advertising campaigns to solicit claimants. Hundreds of claims were filed in the final days and hours before the December 31, 2001 deadline. Reinsurance A reinsurance transaction occurs when an insurer transfers, or cedes, a portion of its exposure to another insurer (reinsurer) for a ceding premium. The reinsurance cession does not legally discharge the insurer from its liability for a covered loss, but provides for reimbursement from the reinsurer for the ceded portion of the risk. We monitor the appropriateness of our reinsurance arrangements to determine that our retention levels are reasonable and that our reinsurers are financially sound, able to meet their obligations under the agreements and that the contracts are competitively priced. 15 Table of Contents Some of our cessions are with AIG subsidiaries, which have earned A.M. Bests financial rating of A+. The A.M. Best financial ratings of our other reinsurers range from A to A+. Our reinsurance arrangements are discussed in more detail in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our net retention of insurance risk after reinsurance for auto and motorcycle lines was 97% in 2002. Effective September 1, 2002, we entered into an agreement to cancel future cessions under our quota share with AIG subsidiaries. From 2003 to 2007, the net retention of insurance risk after reinsurance for auto and motorcycle lines has been unchanged at 100%. Our net retention of insurance risk for personal umbrella policies has been 10% from 2002 to 2007. Personal umbrella coverage is only available to our California auto insurance customers. Approximately 2% of auto insurance customers have umbrella coverage. We also have catastrophe reinsurance agreements relating to the auto line, which reinsures any covered events up to $45.0 million in excess of $20.0 million. Investment Portfolio We utilize a conservative investment philosophy. We continuously monitor the portfolio to minimize interest rate and reinvestment risk. No derivatives are held in our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the Company held publicly traded equity securities, but all were sold in the first quarter of 2006. Substantially all of our fixed maturity portfolio is investment grade, having a weighted average Standard & Poors credit quality of AA. In October 2003, as a result of a competitive bidding process, we entered into an agreement with AIG Global Investment Corp. (AIGGIC) to provide investment management and investment accounting services. The fees are determined as a percentage of the average invested asset balance and are included in net investment income. In November of 2006, the Company engaged Cardinal Investment Advisors, LLC as a third party advisor to assist the Company in such things as setting investment strategy, evaluating AIGGICs performance, and monitoring the portfolios risk/reward profile. Consumer Advocacy For the sixth consecutive year, we are actively engaged in a community education effort for the proper installation and use of child safety seats. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from 2 to 14 years of age. More than 50% of passenger vehicle occupants killed from birth through age 15 were completely unrestrained while riding in the motor vehicle. The 21st child safety program is endorsed by partners in eight states, including California, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Texas. Educational safety events typically include the participation of local media, law enforcement, trained safety technicians and our managers. Since inception, the Company has held more than 94 child safety seat awareness and education events in eight states. At the 21st events, technicians have completed over 10,000 child safety seat inspections and discarded (and then destroyed) more than 3,500 unsafe, broken or recalled child safety seats. 21st has donated over 8,000 brand new child safety seats so that no family leaves an education event without every child riding in a properly fitted child safety seat. 21st has also partnered with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the Arizona Department of Public Safety in public education programs on safe driving. Using billboard advertising in English and Spanish, we have educated and hopefully made positive impressions on the serious topics of Drive Sober and Just Drive, referring to distracted driving (cell phones, eating, reading, etc. while driving). All of the materials are co branded by 21st, the CHP and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, as applicable. 21st also makes the streets safer through its ongoing support of the Los Angeles Police Academy Magnet School, a unique partnership between 21st, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) that prepares young people for careers in law enforcement. Since 1996, 21st has provided approximately $0.5 million to support the program and provide scholarships to graduating cadets entering college. Since the program began, more than 25 Magnet alumni graduates have become LAPD officers. Currently, 33 Magnet alumni are enrolled in the LAPD Police Academy. We have several publications and community events designed to assist customers and potential customers in making choices about their auto insurance and automobile safety. We publish the Child Safety Seat: A Parents Guide, Crash Test Ratings Guide, and a 30 minute documentary, The Golden Road Todays Senior Driver. The Golden Road is designed to help senior drivers and their families correctly assess seniors driving abilities and decrease driving dangers. Both guides and The Golden Road are distributed through public events, direct mail promotions and downloads from our web site. Team Members The Company employed approximately 2,900 full and part time team members at December 31, 2006. We provide medical, pension and 401(k) savings plan benefits to eligible team members, according to the provisions of each plan. The Company also utilized approximately 300 contractors primarily for software development projects. 16 Table of Contents INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION Private passenger automobile insurance represents the largest component of the U.S. Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance industry. In 2005, direct premiums written in the U.S. private passenger auto market was over $160 billion, or slightly over one third of the P&C industry total. Market share is concentrated among the top writers, with the top 10 private passenger auto writers accounting for over 60% of market share. Unless otherwise noted, all industry and market share data were derived directly from data reported by Highline Data LLC, or were estimated using Highline Data as the primary source. We have been the seventh largest writer of personal automobile insurance in California. Market shares in California of the top ten writers of personal automobile insurance, based on direct premiums written, according to Highline Data, for the past five years were as follows: Market Share in California Based on Direct Premiums Written Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 21st Century Insurance Group 6 % 7 % 6 % 6 % 6 % State Farm Group 13 14 14 14 13 Farmers Group 10 10 10 11 12 Mercury General Group 9 9 9 9 8 Automobile Club of Southern California Group 9 9 9 9 9 California State Auto Group 9 9 9 9 10 Allstate Insurance Group 9 8 8 9 11 Progressive Insurance Group 4 3 3 2 2 USAA Group 3 3 3 3 3 Government Employees Group (GEICO) 3 3 3 3 3 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT State Regulation of Insurance Companies Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance departments of the various states. The insurance departments have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, such as: Licensing of insurance companies, claim adjusters, and agents; Prior approval, in California and some other jurisdictions, of premium rates; Establishment of capital and surplus requirements and standards of solvency; Nature of, and limitations on, investments insurers are allowed to hold; Periodic examinations of the affairs of insurers; Annual and other periodic reports of the financial condition and results of operations of insurers; Establishment of statutory accounting rules; Issuance of securities by insurers; Restrictions on payment of dividends; and Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. Currently, the CDI has primary regulatory jurisdiction over two of our subsidiaries, 21st Century Insurance Company and 21st Century Casualty Company, including prior approval of premium rates. The CDI typically conducts a financial examination of our affairs every three years. On June 15, 2004, the CDI finalized its examination reports on the statutory financial statements of the Companys two California domiciled insurance subsidiaries for the three year period ended December 31, 2002. The reports did not contain any findings or adjustments. In general, the current regulatory requirements in the other states in which our subsidiaries are licensed insurers are less restrictive than in California. The CDI and Texas Department of Insurance are currently examining the three year period ended December 31, 2005. In addition to regulation by the CDI, the Company and the personal lines insurance business in general are also subject to legislative, judicial and political action, as well as the normal business forces of competition between companies and the choices consumers make based on their preferences. 17 Table of Contents To our knowledge, no new laws or regulations were enacted in 2006 by any state in which we do business that are expected to have a material impact on the auto insurance industry. In 2006, the California Commissioner adopted regulations that would restrict the use of territory in automobile insurance rating, which potentially could adversely affect the Companys book of business. The Company has until late 2008 to fully comply with the regulations. Litigation by an insurance trade association challenging the validity of the regulations is currently in progress. Also in 2006, the CDI promulgated regulations specifying various expense, investment income and profitability factors to be used by the CDI in reviewing and approving insurers rates. These regulations, which will become effective April 3, 2007, may also negatively affect our California business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information regarding these regulations. Holding Company Regulation We are also subject to regulation by the CDI pursuant to the provisions of the California Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the Holding Company Act). Transactions defined to be of an extraordinary nature may not be effected without the prior approval of the CDI. The Holding Company Act limits the amount of dividends our insurance subsidiaries may pay. An extraordinary transaction includes a dividend which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurance companys policyholders surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the insurance companys statutory net income for the preceding calendar year. The Companys insurance subsidiaries currently have $771.0 million of statutory surplus. Approximately $124.0 million of this amount (the 2006 net income of the Companys primary insurance subsidiary) could be paid as dividends to the parent company without prior approval from the CDI in 2007. In 2006, our primary insurance subsidiary paid $110.0 million in dividends to our holding company. Previously, no dividends had been paid since 2001. Involuntary Business All 50 states and the District of Columbia have established a mechanism to assure that automobile insurance is available to any consumer that otherwise would not be written voluntarily by the private market; this is called the involuntary or residual market. These programs were established by the respective state regulators and are administered by a governing board represented by insurance companies and other representatives. The involuntary market consists of those consumers who, due to a variety of factors such as their driving record or status as first time drivers, represent a high risk. Rates for the involuntary market can be significantly higher than the voluntary market given the cost expectations. The number of private passenger automobiles insured through the involuntary market mechanisms is not distributed evenly among all the states. Depending upon such factors as government regulations, the adequacy of pricing of the involuntary market mechanisms, and industry competition, the size of the involuntary market varies dramatically from one state to another and over time. Over the 10 year period from 1997 to 2006, the involuntary market has decreased both in absolute and relative terms. The percentage of vehicles insured in the involuntary market is declining in part because of sophisticated pricing models, which enable companies to appropriately price for a larger percentage of risks. The California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan (CAARP) is the involuntary private passenger automobile market program in California. The number of assignments for each insurer is based on the total applications received by the plan and the insurers market share. As of December 31, 2006, the number of assigned risk insured vehicles was 437 compared to 1,129 at the end of 2005. As of December 31, 2006, this business represented less than 1% of our total direct premiums written. Underwriting profits were $0.5 million in 2006, compared to underwriting profits of $1.0 million in 2005 and underwriting losses of $0.9 million in 2004. Insurers offering homeowner insurance in California are required to participate in the California FAIR Plan (FAIR Plan). FAIR Plan is a state administered pool of difficult to insure homeowners. Each participating insurer is allocated a percentage of the total premiums written and losses incurred by the pool according to its share of total homeowner direct premiums written in California. Participation in FAIR Plan operations is based a companys writings from two years prior. Since 21st ceased writing homeowners business in 2002, the Company no longer receives assignments for plan years beyond 2004, but continues to participate in prior plan year activity, which is in runoff. Our FAIR Plan underwriting results for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were immaterial. Availability of Filings Copies of our filings with the SEC on Form 10 K, Form 10 Q, Form 8 K and proxy statements are available, along with copies of earnings releases, in the Investor Relations section of the Companys web site at www.21st.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Copies may also be obtained free of charge directly from the Companys Investor Relations Department (6301 Owensmouth Avenue, Woodland Hills, California 91367, phone 818 673 3996). 18 Table of Contents The public may also read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549 (information on the operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1 800 SEC 0330). The SEC also maintains a web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and or operating results. We compete in the automobile insurance market, which is highly competitive. We face vigorous competition from large, well capitalized national companies as well as smaller regional insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies may have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we have. In addition, competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services, which we do not offer. We could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. From time to time, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition and generate growth. If these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our Company and other insurance companies may be required under state mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurers former policyholders. The ability of the Company to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to the Companys success. Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, we must forecast the changing business environments in many geographic markets with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and or employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over staffing, which would adversely affect our cost structure, or under staffing, impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business in one or more business units or locations. In either such event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. The Companys insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex state laws and regulations. The insurance industry is highly regulated and constantly subject to changes in these regulations, many of which could negatively affect our business. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations in their states of domicile as well as in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. Governmental agencies have broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of the insurance business, including trade and claim handling practices, accounting methods, premium pricing, marketing practices, advertising, policy forms, insurance products, and capital adequacy. These agencies are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders or creditors. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things: Establish solvency requirements, including minimum reserves and capital and surplus requirements; Limit the amount of dividends, intercompany loans and other intercompany payments our insurance company subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval; Impose restrictions on the amounts and types of investments we may hold; Control the amount and exposure of losses in Involuntary Markets that companies must bear; Require assessments to pay claims of insolvent insurance companies; and Require that we submit to periodic financial and operational examinations by the state of domicile of our respective insurance company subsidiaries. 19 Table of Contents The failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiarys authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, 21st and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. Although in the past years we have been successful in gaining regulatory approval for rate increases, there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate increases which may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends. As a result of such uncertainties, underwriting losses could occur in the future. Further, we could be required to liquidate investments to pay claims, possibly during unfavorable market conditions, which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments. Adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries earnings or cash flows, which in turn could negatively impact our liquidity. The insurance industry has been the target of litigation. In recent years, insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits including class actions, relating to pricing, sales practices and practices in claims handling, among other matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial jury awards or settlements involving other insurers. Future litigation relating to these or other business practices may negatively affect us by requiring us to pay substantial awards or settlements, increasing our legal costs, diverting management attention from other business issues or harming our reputation with customers. Such litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see Notes 12 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our success is reliant on our ability to properly assess underwriting risks and charge appropriate premiums to policyholders. Our financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and results of operations are reliant on our ability to accurately assess our underwriting risks and charge appropriate premiums based on these risks. The premium we charge must be sufficient to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and allow us to earn a profit. Our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: The availability of sufficient reliable data; Uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally; Our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data; Our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy; Our ability to project changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty; The development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies; Our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations; Our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately; Unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action; Ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices; Unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy; Unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices; and Changing driving patterns. The realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 20 Table of Contents We are primarily a personal automobile insurance carrier, and therefore our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry. As a result of our focus on personal automobile insurance business, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the personal automobile insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Factors that negatively affect cost trends and our profitability include inflation in automobile repair costs, automobile parts, used car prices and medical care costs. Increased litigation of claims may also adversely affect loss costs. In addition, these developments in the personal automobile insurance industry would have a disproportionate affect on us, compared to insurers that are more diversified across multiple business lines. As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophic events. We are subject to claims arising from natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, wildfires, and from man made events such as riots and terrorism. There is typically an increase in the frequency and severity of auto claims whenever one of these events occur. We cannot accurately predict when or where these events will occur and, though we believe we have in place strong catastrophe management initiatives, we are still exposed to catastrophic events and cannot guarantee that our business will not be materially adversely affected should one occur. Further, subsequent to a catastrophic event there can be increases in involuntary market assessments to pay for insolvent companies and uninsured individuals as well as restrictions on the Companys operations imposed by regulatory entities. Inaccuracies in assumptions used in calculating reserve amounts could have a material adverse impact on our net income. The reserves for losses and LAE that we have established represent our best estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses, after considering known facts and our interpretation of circumstances. Reserve estimates are based on historical claims information, industry statistics and other factors. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process. This uncertainty arises from a number of factors, including: The availability of sufficient reliable data; The difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets; Unexpected changes in medical and repair costs; Unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations; New or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts; Inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability; Ongoing changes in claims settlement practices; The accuracy of our estimates of the number or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statement; The accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves; and The accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. There can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our reserves. If loss reserves are not sufficient to cover our actual losses, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position may be materially adversely affected. See further discussion in Item 1. Business Loss and LAE Reserve Development. The Company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business, and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent upon technology systems to effectively manage areas of our business including: underwriting, acquisition of policies, policy servicing, claims handling, accounting and reporting, actuarial reserving functions, and to maintain our policyholder data. We have developed a new information technology platform that is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage our operations as we expand into new states. The failure of any part of this system could cause a disruption to our operations, which could result in a loss of premiums, increased operating costs, an inability to provide customer service or process claims, and delays to or incorrect reporting. Although decreasing over time, we still rely to some extent on the capabilities of our previous system. 21 Table of Contents A security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. In addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. We write a substantial portion of our business in California, and therefore our business may be adversely affected by judicial, legislative, and, regulatory decisions in California, in addition to civil unrest or natural catastrophes. Approximately 89% of our direct premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2006, were generated in California. Our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions, including catastrophic events, and adverse judicial and legislative decisions in California. Changes in any of these conditions or adverse legislation or judicial decisions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. In addition, these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us, compared to insurers that do not have such a geographic concentration. In July 2006, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating (the Auto Rating Factor Regulations). The previous regulation had been validated by a court decision. The new rules required automobile insurance companies to make a class plan and rate filing during the third quarter of 2006 to bring their automobile insurance rates in California into compliance with the Auto Rating Factor Regulations (the current percentage of compliance required is 15% of what will ultimately be required if the regulations remain in effect). Litigation to preliminarily enjoin the implementation of the Auto Rating Factor Regulations and have them declared in violation of California law has been unsuccessful. As a result, the Company submitted class plan and rate filings to the CDI for its review. The Companys rate filing proposed an overall rate decrease of 5% of premium. The CDI approved the Companys class plan and rate filings. The new rates took effect January 3, 2007. Because the new Auto Rating Factor Regulations required every company to make a rate filing, competitive rate levels have changed and consumer shopping behavior may increase in the future. As of this date, most of the Companys main competitors have also had approved overall rate decreases of varying amounts, while some have not substantially changed overall rate levels while attempting to comply with the new regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and changes, which could have either a materially favorable or materially adverse impact on the Company. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations (the Rate Approval Regulations) that would determine how insurance rates for personal auto and most other lines of personal and commercial property and casualty lines of business are established in California. In October 2006, the CDI issued additional amendments to the Rate Approval Regulations. These regulations were submitted in November 2006 to the Office of Administrative Law (the OAL) and were approved in January of 2007. The amended regulations will become effective on April 3, 2007. Multiple changes from the current regulations include capping the maximum permitted after tax rate of return on derived capital at a floating rate equal to a risk free rate of return plus 6% for all affected lines of insurance. The amended Rate Approval Regulations do provide for several variances from the rates specified by the formula, upon approval by the Insurance Commissioner. The amended Rate Approval Regulations could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys results. If the newly elected insurance commissioner does not modify, suspend or withdraw the regulations before they become effective, an industry lawsuit could be brought to challenge the regulations as contrary to current law. Also, the Company could consider bringing its own legal action, once the regulations are applied to it. We cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be effective. Our future financial performance and success are dependent in part upon our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy. Implementation of our growth strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, judicial or legislative developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy or be able to improve our operating results. The Company may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business. The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. For a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents The performance of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to investment risks. Our fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: Interest rate risk The Companys investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments, such as municipal and corporate bonds. Increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities. Declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the Companys investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments into new investments that could yield lower rates than the Companys investments have historically generated. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the Companys control. Although the Company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. The Companys mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value. Despite its mitigation efforts, a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Companys book value. Credit risk The risk that issuers of bonds that we hold will not pay principal or interest when due. Credit defaults and impairments may result in a charge to income as we are forced to write down the value of bonds we hold. Credit rating agencies have downgraded, and may downgrade in the future, certain issuers of fixed maturity securities. At December 31, 2006, our bond portfolio consisted of investment grade securities. Widespread deterioration in the credit quality of issuers could materially impact the value of our invested assets, as well as our earnings, liquidity, and capital. Concentration risk The risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities. Prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage backed securities) The risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio. Reinvestment risk The risk that an investor will not be able to reinvest funds at as favorable a yield as the original investment yields. In addition, the assets in our defined benefit pension plan are invested in a combination of high credit quality fixed maturity securities and equity securities. Adverse changes in the equity markets, reductions in long term interest rates and defaults in the bond market could have a significant effect on our earnings through increased pension costs. If the equity and fixed income markets perform poorly, reducing the value of assets in the defined benefit pension plan, we may incur additional funding costs. Our insurance subsidiaries are limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding companys ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates. Our Company is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Consequently, if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the holding company, or are able to pay only limited amounts, we may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries. Each insurance subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. In certain situations, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company. 23 Table of Contents Our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements, and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. Financial strength and claims paying ability ratings issued by firms such as Standard & Poors, Fitch, Moodys, and A.M. Best have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our ability to attract and retain policies is affected by our ratings with these agencies. Rating agencies assign ratings based upon their evaluations of an insurance companys ability to meet its financial obligations. Our financial strength ratings with A.M. Best, Standard & Poors, and Fitch are A+, A+, and A+, respectively; our respective debt ratings are aa , BBB+, and BBB+; and our outlook is stable with all three agencies. Since these ratings are subject to continuous review, we cannot guarantee the continuation of our favorable ratings. If our ratings were lowered significantly by any one of these agencies relative to those of our competitors, our ability to market products to new customers and to renew the policies of current customers could be harmed. A lowering of our ratings could also limit our access to the capital markets or provide us with less than deserved pricing on new debt sought in the capital markets. These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our net income and liquidity. The majority owner of our stock may take actions conflicting with your interests. The majority owner of our common stock can control the outcome of shareholder votes. In addition, four of our eleven directors, including our Chairman, are current or former officers and employees of the majority holder or its subsidiaries. Through its majority ownership of our stock, the majority holder has the ability to and may influence actions that may conflict with the interest of other shareholders and holders of debt securities. For example, the majority holder may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you, as holders of our stock. In addition, subsidiaries of the majority holder sell personal automobile insurance policies in competition with us. On January 24, 2007, the majority owner, AIG, made a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of the Company common stock it does not own. The proposal is subject to several conditions, including the approval of the transaction by a Special Committee of the Companys Board of Directors who are independent of AIG. The pendency of this proposal for an extended period of time, as well as the failure of the proposed transaction to ultimately be consummated, may have a negative impact on the Companys ability to attract and retain qualified management and employees and consequently effectively carry out its business plans. Please see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this proposal. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the Companys stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require the Company to include in its Form 10 K a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Areas of the Companys internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, or if the Companys auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Companys financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on its stock price. General economic factors may adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic conditions in one or more of the current markets we write business in may adversely affect our financial performance. An increase in interest rates, inflation, energy costs, unemployment levels, consumer debt levels, tax rates, and other economic factors may adversely affect consumer preferences and buying habits. These factors, along with an increase in medical and repair costs could also have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The following table summarizes our significant properties as of December 31, 2006: Purpose Location Approximate Square Footage Owned or Leased Headquarters Woodland Hills, California 406,000 Leased Claims offices Other California 159,000 Leased Claims offices Arizona 13,000 Leased Legal offices Other California 21,100 Leased Service Center Lewisville, Texas 136,000 Owned We lease office space for our headquarters facilities, which are located in Woodland Hills, California. The lease term expires in February 2015 and the lease may be renewed for two consecutive five year periods. We also lease office space in 12 other locations. We anticipate no difficulty in extending these leases or obtaining comparable office facilities in suitable locations and consider our facilities to be adequate for our current needs. The Company purchased a customer service, sales and claims center in Lewisville, Texas, in September 2005 after exercising its option under the terms of its lease agreement to purchase the land and building that house this service center. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the normal course of business, the Company is named as a defendant in lawsuits related to claims and insurance policy issues, both on individual policy files and by class actions seeking to attack the Companys business practices. A description of the legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is contained in Notes 12 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of the Companys security holders during the fourth quarter of 2006. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES (a) Price Range of Common Stock The Companys common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol TW.

The frequency and amount of cash dividends paid per share for the last two years are summarized in the table above. The Companys Board of Directors considers a variety of factors in determining the timing and amount of dividends. Accordingly, the Companys past history of dividend payments does not assure that future dividends will be paid. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends. Our primary insurance subsidiary has capacity to pay approximately $124.0 million in dividends to its parent in 2007 without prior approval of the California Department of Insurance. See Notes 13 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as Liquidity and Capital Resources located in Item 7 of this report for additional information. (e) Shareholder Return Performance Graph Set forth below is a line graph comparing the cumulative total shareholder return on the Companys Common Stock against the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the Standard & Poors Property & Casualty Insurance Index for the period of five years commencing December 31, 2001, and ended December 31, 2006. The graph and table assume $100 was invested on December 31, 2001, in each of the Companys Common Stock, the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the Standard & Poors Property & Casualty Insurance Index, and that all dividends were reinvested. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

The adoption of Statement 158 reduced stockholders equity by approximately $14.2 million as of December 31, 2006 (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company entered into a $60.0 million sale leaseback transaction in 2002 and issued $100.0 million of Senior Notes in 2003 (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. MD&A includes the following sections: Overview Results of Operations Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Commitments Transactions with Related Parties Critical Accounting Estimates Recent Accounting Pronouncements Forward Looking Statements OVERVIEW General 21st Century Insurance Group is an insurance holding company registered on the New York Stock Exchange.

Our insurance subsidiaries, 21st Century Insurance Company (our primary insurance subsidiary), 21st Century Casualty Company, and 21st Century Insurance Company of the Southwest (21st of the Southwest), are rated A+ by A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poors. The Companys A+ rating was affirmed by A.M. Best on June 13, 2006. 27 Table of Contents The common stock of the Company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol TW. Through several of its subsidiaries, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) owned approximately 62% of the Companys outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2006. Our long term financial goals include achieving a 96% or lower combined ratio, 15% annual growth in premiums written, 15% return on stockholders equity, and strong financial ratings. Please refer to Item 1. Business for additional information on the Companys long term financial goals and a discussion of insurance terminology used throughout this document. National Expansion The Company is implementing a multi year strategy for national expansion to realize benefits from economies of scale, lower unit marketing costs due to the cost efficiency of buying advertising on a national basis, less dependency on any single market and the operating flexibility to focus resources on attractive markets and deemphasize less attractive markets. In execution of this strategy, 21st expanded its operations into the Midwest (2004); Texas (2005); Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania (second quarter of 2006); New Jersey (October 2006); and Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin (fourth quarter 2006). During 2006, the Company has increased the percentage of the U.S. personal auto market in which it operates from 34 percent to 60 percent. Year over year growth in direct premiums written in non California markets in 2006 was 77.3% versus 81.6% in 2005. Non California direct premiums written comprised 11.3% of our total direct premiums written in 2006, versus 6.2% in 2005. Continued implementation of our growth strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, judicial, regulatory, or legislative developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs. Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 % Change 06 vs.05 % Change 05 vs.04 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,370 $ 1,337,198 (2.3 )% 0.7 % Net premiums written 1,309,687 1,341,418 1,332,384 (2.4 ) 0.7 Net premiums earned 1,307,585 1,352,937 1,313,670 (3.4 ) 3.0 Net losses and LAE (920,846 ) (998,933 ) (993,841 ) (7.8 ) 0.5 Underwriting expenses (303,782 ) (284,334 ) (258,571 ) 6.8 10.0 Underwriting profit $ 82,957 $ 69,670 $ 61,258 19.1 13.7 Financial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: Total direct premiums written decreased 2.3% to $1,315.1 million in 2006, from $1,346.4 million and $1,337.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. California direct premiums written decreased 7.6% to $1,166.0 million in 2006, compared to $1,262.3 million and $1,290.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Non California direct premiums written increased 77.3% to $149.1 million in 2006, compared to $84.1 million and $46.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 consolidated combined ratio was 93.7%, versus 94.9% and 95.3% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 2006 was positively impacted by 4.0 points of favorable prior accident year loss and LAE reserve development in 2006, while 2005 was favorably impacted by 1.9 points of prior accident year development. 2004 was not impacted by prior accident year development. For 2006, 21sts insurance subsidiaries achieved underwriting profitability, but total direct premiums written declined for the year. The California market, which represented 88.7% of our total direct premiums written during 2006, has seen stable to declining rates from competitors and a reduced level of shopping behavior by consumers, which reduced our opportunities for profitable growth in this state. However, 21st realized 77.3% of growth in non California states during 2006 as a result of the Companys national expansion efforts. Our non California direct premiums written grew from 6.2% in 2005 to 11.3% of out total book of business in 2006. 28 Table of Contents The loss and LAE ratios of 70.5%, 73.8%, and 75.6% for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, have decreased since 2002 primarily due to favorable loss development, improvements in our pricing and underwriting methods and the favorable impact of declining frequency trends and moderate claim severity trends. The underwriting expense to net premiums earned ratio increased to 23.2% in 2006 from 21.1% and 19.7% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. These underwriting expense ratio increases are primarily the result of expenses associated with the Companys national expansion efforts and the 2006 recognition of stock based compensation, which were partially offset by deferred policy acquisition costs. The 2005 increase was primarily due to our investments in the geographic expansion strategy, costs associated with the conversion to our new technology platform, and facility and support costs. The increase in 2004 consists primarily of increased advertising costs, additional sales workforce costs, and facility and support costs to improve service and support the Texas service center. Net income increased 11.2% to $97.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or $1.13 per basic share, compared to $87.4 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and $88.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 results include prior year favorable reserve development totaling $51.9 million, versus $25.1 million and $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The recognition of stock based compensation resulted from our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). FAS 123R requires the recognition of compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the estimated fair value of the employee share based options. See Critical Accounting Estimates Stock Based Compensation Cost for further discussion. Stock based compensation classified as underwriting expense for 2006 was $6.1 million. In July 2006, the California Department of Insurance (the CDI) obtained approval for changes to regulations (the Auto Rating Factor Regulations) relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating. Because the new Auto Rating Factor Regulations require every personal auto insurance company operating in California to make a class plan and rate filing in the third quarter of 2006, competitive rate levels have changed and consumer shopping behavior may increase in the future. As of this date, the Company has filed for an overall rate decrease in California of approximately 5% of premium. The CDI approved the Companys class plan and rate filings. The new rates took effect January 3, 2007. Most of the Companys main competitors have also had approved overall rate decreases of varying amounts, while some have not substantially changed overall rate levels while attempting to comply with the new regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these changes, which could have either a materially favorable or materially adverse impact on the Company. All rate changes and class plan filings must be approved by the CDI. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations (the Rate Approval Regulations), affecting personal auto, homeowners and most lines of commercial property and casualty insurance written in California. The regulations become effective on April 3, 2007. If newly elected insurance commissioner does not modify, suspend or withdraw the regulations before they become effective, an industry lawsuit could be brought to challenge the regulations as contrary to current law. Also, the Company could consider bringing its own legal action, once the regulations are applied to it. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Proposal for Offer On January 24, 2007, the majority owner, AIG, made a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of the Company common stock it does not own. The proposal is subject to several conditions, including the approval of the transaction by a Special Committee of the Companys Board of Directors who are independent of AIG. The proposal could have a negative impact on the Companys ability to carry out its business plans. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Streamlining of Operations On February 26, 2007, the Company announced it expects to incur approximately $3.7 million in severance costs during the first quarter of 2007 in connection with a four percent reduction of its total work force. Non GAAP Measures Information concerning premiums written, underwriting profit, combined ratios, and statutory surplus have been presented to enhance readers understanding of the Companys operations. These are widely used financial measures in the insurance industry that happen not to have formal definitions currently under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Premiums written represent the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period. We use premiums written as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period. The most directly comparable GAAP measure, premiums earned, represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as income on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. 29 Table of Contents Underwriting profit (loss) consists of net premiums earned less losses from claims, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. 21st believes that underwriting profit (loss) provides investors with financial information that is not only meaningful, but critically important to understanding the results of property and casualty insurance operations. The results of operations of a property and casualty insurance company include three components: underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). Without disclosure of underwriting profit (loss), it is difficult to determine how successful an insurance company is in its core business activity of assessing and underwriting risk, as including investment income and realized capital gains (losses) in the results of operations without disclosing underwriting profit (loss) can mask underwriting losses. Statutory surplus represents equity as of the end of a fiscal period for the Companys insurance subsidiaries, determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Stockholders equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to statutory surplus. The reconciliations of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are located in the following: premiums written and underwriting profit are located in the Results of Operations and statutory surplus is located in Liquidity and Capital Resources. These financial measures are not intended to replace, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures. See Results of Operations for more details as to our overall and personal auto lines results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results The following table reconciles our personal auto lines underwriting profit to our consolidated results of operations: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 % Change 06 vs.05 % Change 05 vs.04 Personal auto lines underwriting profit $ 83,708 $ 71,995 $ 63,972 16.3 % 12.5 % Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff, underwriting loss (751 ) (2,325 ) (2,714 ) (67.7 ) (14.3 ) Net investment income 68,493 69,096 58,831 (0.9 ) 17.4 Other income 638 367 73.8 N/M1 Net realized investment (losses) gains (1,429 ) (3,272 ) 10,831 (56.3 ) (130.2 ) Other expense (1,860 ) (410 ) N/M1 N/M1 Interest and fees expense (7,348 ) (8,019 ) (8,627 ) (8.4 ) (7.0 ) Provision for income taxes (44,223 ) (40,006 ) (34,068 ) 10.5 17.4 Net income $ 97,228 $ 87,426 $ 88,225 11.2 (0.9 ) Basic earnings per share $ 1.13 $ 1.02 $ 1.03 10.7 (1.0 ) Diluted earnings per share $ 1.12 $ 1.02 $ 1.03 10.2 (1.0 ) Underwriting results above include the effect of prior years reserve redundancy recorded in the current year. The following table summarizes losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) incurred, net of applicable reinsurance, for the periods indicated: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net losses and LAE: Current accident year $ 972,743 $ 1,024,073 $ 993,948 Prior accident years Personal auto lines (52,648 ) (27,473 ) (2,936 ) Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 751 2,333 2,831 Total prior years redundancy recorded in current year (51,897 ) (25,140 ) (105 ) Total net losses and LAE incurred $ 920,846 $ 998,933 $ 993,843 1 Ratio is not meaningful. 30 Table of Contents We perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of carried unpaid losses and LAE. These estimates depend on many assumptions about the outcome of future events. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and LAE will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and materially differ from our unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2006, 2005, or 2004. In the future, if the unpaid losses and LAE develop redundancies or deficiencies, such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact, respectively, on future results of operations. See Critical Accounting Estimates Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for additional discussion of our reserving policy. Personal Auto Lines Underwriting Results Personal automobile insurance is our primary line of business. Non California vehicles accounted for 11.3%, 6.2%, and 3.5% of our direct premiums written in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This increase is due to our ongoing national expansion program, which includes marketing in non California states. The Company currently plans to expand into additional states to further its national expansion strategy. The following table presents the components of our personal auto lines underwriting profit and the components of the combined ratio for the past three years: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Personal Auto Lines % Change % Change Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 06 vs.05 05 vs.04 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,371 $ 1,337,190 (2.3 )% 0.7 % Net premiums written $ 1,309,687 $ 1,341,419 $ 1,332,375 (2.4 ) 0.7 Net premiums earned $ 1,307,585 $ 1,352,928 $ 1,313,551 (3.4 ) 3.0 Net losses and LAE (920,095 ) (996,599 ) (991,008 ) (7.7 ) 0.6 Underwriting expenses (303,782 ) (284,334 ) (258,571 ) 6.8 10.0 Underwriting profit $ 83,708 $ 71,995 $ 63,972 16.3 12.5 Ratios: Loss and LAE ratio 70.4 % 73.7 % 75.4 % (3.3 ) (1.7 ) Underwriting expense ratio 23.2 21.0 19.7 2.2 1.3 Combined ratio 93.6 % 94.7 % 95.1 % (1.1 ) (0.4 ) The following table reconciles our personal auto lines direct premiums written to net premiums earned: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,371 $ 1,337,190 Ceded premiums written (5,420 ) (4,952 ) (4,815 ) Net premiums written 1,309,687 1,341,419 1,332,375 Net change in unearned premiums (2,102 ) 11,509 (18,824 ) Net premiums earned $ 1,307,585 $ 1,352,928 $ 1,313,551 Direct premiums written decreased 2.3% in 2006, while increasing 0.7% in 2005 and 9.3% in 2004; less than our long term goal of 15%. Market conditions in California were somewhat less favorable for growth in 2006 than in the preceding two years. Since 2004, we have met our profitability goals, posting our best combined ratios since 1999 and our direct premiums written grew 9.3% in 2004 despite an increasingly competitive California marketing climate. As discussed in the Highlights, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating in July 2006. It is not possible at this time to predict the impact of these changes, which could have either a favorable or adverse impact on the Company. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations, subsequently amended in October of 2006 and approved in January of 2007 with an effective date of April 3, 2007. The regulations could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys California results. See further discussion of both regulations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. As the Company proceeds with its national expansion, we believe that achieving our long term growth goal will steadily depend less on the California marketplace. The Companys national expansion efforts will provide us with flexibility to use combinations of local and national marketing media, as appropriate, and the ability to focus our marketing expenditures and Company resources on attractive markets, while minimizing costs in less attractive markets. The declines in the loss and LAE ratios for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, of 3.3 points, 1.7 points, and 3.1 points, respectively, are primarily due to the effect of favorable development related to prior accident years and lower accident frequency. The effects on the net loss and LAE ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were as follows: 4.0 points ($52.6 million) of favorable reserve development in 2006, 2.0 points ($27.5 million) of favorable reserve development in 2005, and 0.2 points ($2.9 million) of favorable reserve development in 2004. For additional discussion of these estimates, please see Item 1 of this report under the heading Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. In general, changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted, usually in conjunction with our quarterly actuarial review. 31 Table of Contents The underwriting expense ratios to net premiums earned increased for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The 2006 increase was primarily due to our investments in the Companys national expansion efforts and the 2006 recognition of stock based compensation, partially offset by an increase in deferred policy acquisition costs. The 2005 increase was primarily due to our investments in the geographic expansion strategy, costs associated with the conversion to our new technology platform, and facility and support costs. The increase in 2004 consists primarily of increased advertising costs, additional sales workforce costs, and facility and support costs to improve service and support the Texas service center. Homeowner and Earthquake Lines in Runoff Results We have not written any earthquake policies since 1994 and exited the voluntary homeowner insurance business in 2002. Underwriting results of the homeowner and earthquake lines, which are in runoff, include losses and LAE incurred of $0.8 million, $2.3 million, and $2.8 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, of which the earthquake lines accounted for $0.1 million, $0.4 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. Net Investment Income We utilize a conservative investment philosophy. Substantially the entire fixed maturity securities portfolio is investment grade, having a weighted average Standard & Poors credit quality of AA. No derivatives are held in our investment portfolio and there were no publicly traded equity securities at December 31, 2006. We previously held publicly traded equities, but sold them in the first quarter of 2006, lowering the risk and yield of the overall investment portfolio. The components of net investment income were as follows: Net Investment Income AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 Interest on fixed maturity securities $ 67,449 $ 63,122 $ 57,729 Interest on cash and cash equivalents 1,272 1,188 585 Interest on other long term investments 63 Dividends on equity securities 811 5,848 1,484 Total investment income 69,595 70,159 59,798 Investment expense (1,102 ) (1,063 ) (967 ) Net investment income $ 68,493 $ 69,096 $ 58,831 The fixed maturity securities portfolio comprised 99%, 97%, and 97% of the total investment portfolio at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The average annual yields on fixed maturity securities were as follows: Average Annual Yields on Fixed Maturity Securities Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Pre tax fixed maturity securities 4.6% 4.6% 4.4% After tax fixed maturity securities 3.3% 3.3% 3.2% At December 31, 2006, $379.4 million, or 26.4%, of our total fixed maturity securities at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds, compared to 23.1% at December 31, 2005, with the remainder, representing 73.6% of the portfolio, invested in taxable securities, compared to 76.9% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, no investments were rated below investment grade. The net realized (losses) gains on investments were as follows: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gross realized gains $ 1,953 $ 6,574 $ 14,145 Gross realized losses (2,603 ) (9,482 ) (2,465 ) Net realized (losses) gains $ (650 ) $ (2,908 ) $ 11,680 Our policy is to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, all investments for other than temporary impairment when the fair value of a security falls below its cost or amortized cost, based on all relevant facts and circumstances. No such impairments were recorded in 2006, 2005, or 2004 (see discussion under Critical Accounting Estimates Investments). 32 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income of $0.6 million and $0.4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, consists of interest income relating to claims with taxing authorities. Other expense of $1.8 million in 2006 consists of the following: a $0.9 million impairment charge for vacated space in our headquarters in Woodland Hills, California, and a $0.9 million write off of software projects due to impairment. Other expense of $0.4 million in 2005 also relates to an impairment charge for vacated space in our headquarters. No other income or expense was reported in 2004. FINANCIAL CONDITION Investments and cash were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. The Company sold its investments in equity securities during the first quarter of 2006, with the proceeds primarily reinvested in fixed maturity securities. The Company did not hold any publicly traded equity securities at December 31, 2006. However, we executed a $35 million funding commitment for a private equity investment program during the second quarter of 2006, as described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company funded $14.4 million of the commitment in 2006. At December 31, 2006, 26.2% of our total investments were in tax exempt, fixed income securities, compared to 22.3% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, investment grade securities comprised substantially all of the fair value of our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2006, no investments were rated below investment grade. The Company also has unrated, community investments representing 1.4% of total investments. These investments have been made in an effort to provide housing and other services to economically disadvantaged communities. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Increased advertising, sales and customer service costs through December 31, 2006 contributed to a $3.7 million increase in deferred policy acquisitions costs (DPAC) to $63.6 million, compared to $59.9 million at December 31, 2005. The Companys DPAC is estimated to be fully recoverable (see Critical Accounting Estimates Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs). The following table summarizes unpaid losses and LAE, gross and net of applicable reinsurance, with respect to our lines of business: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 Years Ended December 31, Gross Net Gross Net Unpaid losses and LAE: Personal auto lines $ 480,731 $ 475,261 $ 521,528 $ 516,849 Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 1,538 808 2,307 1,369 Total $ 482,269 $ 476,069 $ 523,835 $ 518,218 The following analysis provides a reconciliation of the activity in the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 At beginning of year: Reserve for losses and LAE, gross of reinsurance $ 523,835 $ 495,542 $ 438,323 Reinsurance recoverable (5,617 ) (4,645 ) (8,964 ) Reserve for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance 518,218 490,897 429,359 Losses and LAE incurred, net of reinsurance: Current year 972,743 1,024,073 993,946 Prior years (51,897 ) (25,140 ) (105 ) Total 920,846 998,933 993,841 Losses and LAE paid, net of reinsurance: Current year 662,036 684,474 642,664 Prior years 300,959 287,138 289,639 Total 962,995 971,612 932,303 At end of year: Reserve for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance 476,069 518,218 490,897 Reinsurance recoverable 6,200 5,617 4,645 Reserve for losses and LAE, gross of reinsurance $ 482,269 $ 523,835 $ 495,542 At December 31, 2006, gross unpaid losses and LAE decreased $41.6 million, primarily due to a reserve decrease of $40.8 million in the personal auto lines as a result of $52.6 million of favorable loss development related to prior accident years recorded during the year ended December 31, 2006 and a decline in the number of insured vehicles. The gross unpaid losses and LAE in the homeowner and earthquake lines decreased $0.8 million as the result of continued runoff activity (see Critical Accounting Estimates Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for a description of the Companys reserving process). 33 Table of Contents Debt of $115.9 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $128.0 million at December 31, 2005, consists of $16.0 million of capital lease obligations and $99.9 million Senior Notes, net of discount (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in debt of $12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily attributable to principal payments on the capital leases. Stockholders equity and book value per share increased to $898.5 million and $10.39, respectively, at December 31, 2006, compared to $830.0 million and $9.66 at December 31, 2005. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to net income of $97.2 million, stock based compensation cost of $10.4 million, and $5.7 million of proceeds from exercised stock options. This was partially offset by dividends to stockholders of $27.6 million, a decrease of $14.2 million due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, as disclosed in Recent Accounting Pronouncements, and an increase in net unrealized losses on available for sale investments of $3.5 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Holding Company Our holding companys main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries, borrowing from our primary insurance subsidiary, and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities. Apart from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock grants to employees, the effects of which have not been significant, we have not issued any equity securities since 1998 when AIG exercised its warrants to purchase 16 million shares of common stock for cash of $145.6 million. Our insurance subsidiaries did not pay any dividends to our holding company from 2001 to 2004 due to the previous uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries in California, which was resolved in 2004. Our primary insurance subsidiary, 21st Century Insurance Company, declared and paid a $110.0 million dividend in December 2006. On November 30, 2005, the CDI permitted an amendment to a term loan line that increased the available amount from $40 million to $150 million that our insurance subsidiary, 21st Century Insurance Company, can loan to our holding company. The term loan line had a zero balance at December 31, 2006. See further information in the Notes to Condensed Financial Information of Registrant. Effective December 31, 2003, the California Department of Insurance approved an intercompany lease whereby 21st Century Insurance Company leases certain computer software from our holding company. The monthly lease payment, currently $0.8 million, started in January 2004 and has been subject to upward adjustments based on the cost incurred by the holding company to enhance the software. Our holding companys significant cash obligations over the next several years consist of the following: Ongoing costs to enhance our computer software; Implementing the Companys geographic growth strategy; The repayment of the $100 million principal on the Senior Notes due in 2013; Related interest on the Senior Notes above; and Any dividends to stockholders that our directors may declare. We expect to be able to meet those obligations from sources of cash currently available (i.e., cash and investments at the holding company, which totaled $42.1 million at December 31, 2006, dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries, payments received from the intercompany lease, and borrowing from our primary insurance subsidiary), or additional funds obtainable from the capital markets. The effective California state income tax rate applicable to dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries is approximately 1.8%, or 1.2% net of federal benefit. Our primary insurance subsidiary could pay up to approximately $124.0 million in 2007 as dividends to the holding company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance Subsidiaries We have achieved underwriting profits in our core auto insurance operations since 2001 and have thereby enhanced our liquidity. Our cash flows from operations and short term cash position generally are more than sufficient to meet obligations for claim payments, which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year. Our underwriting results are impacted by rate changes. Although in the past years we have been successful in gaining California regulatory approval for rate changes, there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate changes that may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends. 34 Table of Contents As discussed in the Highlights, in July 2006, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these changes, which could have either a materially favorable or materially adverse impact on the Company. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations, subsequently amended in October of 2006, could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys California results. The regulations become effective April 3, 2007. If the newly elected insurance commissioner does not modify, suspend or withdraw the regulations before they become effective, an industry lawsuit could be brought to challenge the regulations as contrary to current law. Also, the Company could consider bringing its own legal action, once the regulations are applied to it. See further discussion of both regulations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Also, in the event of adverse claims results, we could be forced to liquidate investments to pay claims, possibly during unfavorable market conditions, which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments. Adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries earnings or cash flows, which in turn, could negatively impact our liquidity. The NAIC employs a risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurance companies that establishes recommended minimum capital requirements. The formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics, as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure, investment policies, reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors. Based on the formula adopted by the NAIC, the Company has calculated a combined Company Action Level risk based capital requirement of $172.9 million for its insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006. Each of the insurance companies statutory surplus exceeded their respective level of minimum required capital. As of December 31, 2006, our insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of $771.0 million compared to $704.7 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in statutory surplus was primarily due to statutory net income of $124.5 million and a decrease in nonadmitted assets of $64.2 million, partially offset by dividends to the Parent of $110.0 million and a $15.6 million decrease in the deferred income tax asset. The following table reconciles stockholders equity to statutory surplus.

This was partially offset by decreases in loss and LAE payments. Also, while underwriting expenses and policy acquisition costs increased over the prior year, cash outflows for those expenses decreased slightly due to the increase in unpaid other liabilities of $14.0 million which deferred payment of expenditures incurred in connection with our national expansion efforts. Investing Activities Our cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales, maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities. Our investment objective is to maintain a low level of risk and to preserve principal by investing in high quality, investment grade securities while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities increased due to a $1.4 million decrease in net acquisitions (purchases, net of maturities, calls and sales) of investments primarily as a result of the redeployment of cash equivalents and a $5.8 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities decreased due to the doubling of the quarterly dividend since the prior year from $0.04 per share to $0.08 per share, resulting in a $13.9 million increase in dividends paid, and a $1.2 million increase in debt payments, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in cash receipts provided by stock option exercises. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS We have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Certain contractual obligations, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. 36 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding Senior Notes. Payments Due by Period AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS Total 2007 2008 through 2009 2010 through 2011 Remaining years after 2011 Senior notes $ 141.3 $ 5.9 $ 11.8 $ 11.8 $ 111.8 Capital lease obligations 16.7 14.9 1.3 0.5 Debt 158.0 20.8 13.1 12.3 111.8 Operating leases 2 154.2 26.1 41.3 35.8 51.0 Other long term commitments 2.2 0.7 0.8 0.5 0.2 Future pension benefit payments 3 72.1 3.3 8.0 11.1 49.7 Expected loss and LAE payments, net of reinsurance 476.0 322.2 140.0 11.6 2.2 Total4 $ 862.5 $ 373.1 $ 203.2 $ 71.3 $ 214.9 The table above excludes periodic contributions to pension plans, which are discussed below, and commitments for investment purchases discussed in Transactions with Related Parties. The capital lease obligations above resulted from a sale leaseback transaction and an auto capital lease transaction (see further discussion of these items in Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We have no material purchase obligations or other on or off balance sheet long term liabilities or obligations at December 31, 2006 (see discussion about variable interest entities in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our primary insurance subsidiary is responsible for making payments on both the capital lease obligations and most of the operating lease obligations. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Total contributions to the plans were $0.9 million, $10.0 million and $2.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. For the past several years we have followed the practice of contributing sufficient amounts to the qualified defined benefit pension plan to meet or exceed statutory funding requirements, without exceeding the maximum amount that would be deductible for corporate income tax purposes, and while maintaining plan assets at a level at least equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. The amount and timing of future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan depends on a number of unpredictable factors including statutory funding requirements, the market performance of the plans assets, cash requirements for benefit payments to retirees, and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Contributions to our non qualified defined benefit pension plan generally are limited to amounts needed to make benefit payments to retirees, which are expected to total approximately $0.9 million in 2007. It is managements belief that the total net loss and LAE reserve amount of $476.0 million at December 31, 2006 is adequate to cover unpaid losses and LAE as of December 31, 2006. The amount and timing of the reserve payments may be subject to the outcome of future events, such as changes in medical and repair costs, as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims. The variability of the ultimate settlement amount is likely to increase as the time between the occurrence and settlement of the claim is increased. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We currently have no letters of credit, no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value, and no obligations under any derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company has no material retained interests in assets transferred to any unconsolidated entity (see further discussion in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). However, 21st Century Insurance Group has issued guarantees on behalf of its insurance subsidiaries related to the capital lease obligations described above. Our Board of Directors has made a commitment to invest a portion of policyholder surplus in economically disadvantaged communities. In connection with this commitment, the Company has guaranteed 11.1%, or $42.2 million, of a warehouse financing agreement. The Company has also committed $20.1 million for other community investment purposes. These commitments, which do not significantly impact the Companys liquidity or capital, are further discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Includes amounts due under long term software license agreements of approximately $23.8 million. 3 Includes benefit payments through 2015. 4 Purchase commitments of $0.2 million were excluded from the summary, as they are not material. 37 Table of Contents TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES Several subsidiaries of AIG together own approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock and four of the eleven members of our Board of Directors, including our Chairman, are current or former officers and employees of AIG or its subsidiaries. Since 1995, the Company has entered into transactions with AIG subsidiaries, including reinsurance agreements, corporate insurance coverage, and investment management and investment accounting. Reinsurance Agreements The Company has a catastrophe reinsurance agreement for the comprehensive portion of its auto physical damage lines that is provided by three participating entities, two of which are AIG subsidiaries. Together they reinsure any covered event up to $45.0 million in excess of $20.0 million. This coverage was renewed effective January 1, 2006 and 2007 (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Total premiums ceded to AIG subsidiaries were $1.0 million, $1.0 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Total reinsurance recoverables, net of payables, from AIG subsidiaries were $0.4 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corporate Insurance Coverage The Company has obtained the following corporate insurance policies from AIG subsidiaries: Workers compensation insurance General liability insurance Property insurance Umbrella excess insurance Fiduciary liability insurance Fidelity insurance Auto insurance Employment practices liability insurance Errors and omissions insurance was carried with AIG through September 30, 2005. Total expense attributable to AIG corporate insurance coverages was $3.7 million, $2.9 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31,2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Investment management and investment accounting In October 2003, as a result of a competitive bidding process, we entered into an agreement with AIG Global Investment Corp. (AIGGIC) to provide investment management and investment accounting services. The fees are determined as a percentage of the average invested asset balance and are classified with net investment income. This agreement was approved by the CDI. Investment management and accounting expense was $1.1 million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In June 2006, the Company executed a $35 million funding commitment for a private equity investment program, which is managed by AIGGIC. In the event that we do not respond to a capital call during the investment term, the General Partner of the fund (GP) may apply the following default provisions: withhold 50% of distributions due to us at the time of the default and 50% of future distributions due to the Company; hold the Company liable for fund expenses above and beyond investments made by us (with the right of offset); terminate our Limited Partner status and not allow it any further investments; or charge interest on the defaulted capital commitment amount and fees at LIBOR + 4% (with the right of offset). However, the GP may choose not to designate the Company a defaulting limited partner and waive the default provisions. The investment term ends after the underlying investments are liquidated, but in no event is longer than 10 years. Multiple investments are expected to be purchased and liquidated over the investment term. The Company funded $14.4 million of the commitment in 2006. Software and data processing Through December 31, 2004, the Company utilized certain third party software and data processing monitoring tools under an agreement negotiated by AIG. Since January 1, 2005, the Company has negotiated its own contracts, and no longer incurs any software or data processing costs with AIG subsidiaries. Charges by AIG for software and data processing were $0.3 million in 2004. There was no expense in either 2005 or 2006. 38 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are essential to understanding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and Change in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The following is a summary of the more critical accounting estimates. In each area, we have discussed the assumptions most important in the estimation process. We have used the best information available to estimate the related items involved. Actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key assumptions could change future valuations and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The estimated liabilities for losses and LAE include estimates of the ultimate resolution for known claims reported on or prior to the balance sheet dates, estimates of losses for claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of expenses for investigating, adjusting and settling all incurred claims. Amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. The estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events, such as changes in medical and repair costs, as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the variability of the ultimate settlement amount is likely to increase as the time between the occurrence and settlement of the claim increased. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually monitored, reviewed, and updated. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating income on a dollar for dollar basis. For example, an upward revision of $1 million in the estimated recorded liability for unpaid losses and LAE would decrease underwriting profit, and pre tax income, by the same $1 million amount. Conversely, a downward revision of $1 million would increase pre tax income by the same $1 million amount. It is managements belief that the reserves for losses and LAE are adequate to cover unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2006. While we perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of established unpaid losses and LAE reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and LAE will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and possibly differ materially from our unpaid losses and LAE recorded at December 31, 2006. In the future, if the unpaid losses and LAE develop redundancies or deficiencies, such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact, respectively, on future results of operations. Because these are unknown future events, there is uncertainty in the Companys estimates of ultimate losses and LAE. This uncertainty comes from various factors, both positive and negative, that may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns, changes in regulatory and legal environment, and inflation rates. The Company does not make a specific provision for these uncertainties; however, they are considered in establishing the reserves by analyzing historical patterns and trends. The process of estimating unpaid losses and LAE begins with the review of the actual claims experience, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, mix of business, and changes in certain other factors such as weather and recent tort activity that may affect the loss and LAE ratio. Based on this review, our actuaries prepare several point estimates of unpaid losses and LAE for each of the coverages, and they use their experience and judgment to arrive at an overall actuarial point estimate of the unpaid losses and LAE for that coverage. Meetings are held with appropriate departments to discuss significant issues as a result of the review. This process culminates in a reserve meeting to review the unpaid losses and LAE. The basis for carried unpaid losses and LAE is the overall actuarial point estimate. Other relevant internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying policy pricing, exposure and policy forms, claims handling, and geographic distribution shifts. As a result of the meeting, unpaid losses and LAE are finalized and we record quarterly changes in unpaid losses and LAE for each of our coverages. The overall change in our unpaid losses and LAE is based on the sum of these coverage level changes. 39 Table of Contents The point estimate methods include the use of several commonly accepted actuarial methods utilizing paid and incurred loss histories, claim frequency and severity, and expected loss ratios. The incurred loss development method analyzes historical case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserves) development to estimate ultimate losses. The Company applies loss development factors against case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate losses. The paid loss development method is similar to the incurred loss development method except only paid losses are used. The claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate ultimate claim counts. The Company applies these development factors against claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate claim counts. Severity is the amount of loss per claim. The average severity method analyzes historical severity development to calculate an ultimate average cost per claim. From this, the ultimate severity can be estimated. The claim count development method coupled with the average severity method also provides useful information regarding frequency and inflationary trends that the Company believes is useful in setting reserves. In states with little operating history the Companys experience is supplemented with industry statistics. The Company uses similar methods for LAE. The Company estimates the loss IBNR reserves as the difference between its projection of ultimate losses and the sum of the payments and case reserves for losses. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration, including managerial judgment, to assure management satisfaction that the overall unpaid losses and LAE are adequate to meet projected losses. For example, in property damage coverages, repair cost trends by geographic region vary significantly. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends that are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the loss costs recognized. Judgment is required in analyzing the appropriateness of the various methods and factors to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such prior trends. For example, changes in limits distributions or development in the most recent accident months would require more judgment. We do not believe disclosure of specific indicated point estimates as calculated by the various methods would be meaningful. Any one actuarial point estimate is based on a particular series of judgments and assumptions of the actuary. Another actuary may make different assumptions, and therefore reach a different point estimate. There is a potential for significant variation in ultimate development of unpaid losses and LAE. Most automobile claims are reported within two to three months whereas the estimate of ultimate severities exhibits greater variability at the same maturity. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development and there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity Analysis The Company uses numerous assumptions in determining its best estimates of reserves for losses and LAE for each coverage of the personal auto business. If actual experience differs from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss and LAE reserves. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on the loss and LAE reserve position of using alternative loss cost trend or loss development factor assumptions rather than those actually used in determining the best estimates in the year end loss and LAE reserve analyses for 2006. The analysis addresses the personal auto business in California for which a material deviation to the Companys overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible, and uses what the Company believes is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve development will be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss cost trend or loss development assumptions, or that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not materially affect reserve development for a particular coverage. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior years since 1994, in Managements judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2006 loss and LAE reserve analysis will range from negative 13% to positive six percent, or approximately 12% lower and seven percent higher than the assumptions utilized in the year end 2006 reserve analysis. These changes in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately an $84 million decrease or a $47 million increase in the loss and LAE reserves. It should be emphasized that these deviations are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by the Company to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. The assumed loss development factors are also a key assumption. After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since 1999, in Managements judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 1.6 percent lower than those actually utilized in the year end 2006 loss and LAE reserve analysis to approximately 0.8 percent higher than those actually utilized. If the loss development factor assumptions were reduced by 1.6 percent and increased by 0.8 percent, the loss and LAE reserves would decrease by approximately $86 million under the lower assumptions or increase by approximately $42 million under the higher assumptions. Generally, historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate by more than the amounts illustrated above. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims. Thus, there is the potential for variations greater than the amounts cited above, either negatively or positively. 40 Table of Contents The primary responsibility of an insurance company is paying claims of its policyholders in a fair and timely manner. Having adequate loss reserves, with special consideration for the upside potential of claims not yet paid is central to this responsibility. The company experienced significant losses from the 1995 Northridge earthquake and the subsequent reopening of claims resulting from SB 1899. The costs related to both the original event and SB 1899 illustrate the uncertainty that can result from estimating loss reserves. The number and severity of claims far exceeded initial estimates of losses. The two Northridge events point to the importance of the adequacy of loss reserves and the inherent estimating uncertainties of the loss reserving process. Investments Investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on managements intentions at inception with respect to either holding or selling the securities. The classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise, whereas for available for sale securities they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized. The fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources. The cost of investment securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. We are obligated to assess, at each reporting date, whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities. In general, a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment based upon the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer), The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization, and The probability of non realization of a full recovery on our investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. For investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events, where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, such as when it is determined that an issuer is unable to repay the entire principal, a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value. The determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment. The Companys intent is to hold all of its fixed securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity as long as these securities continue to be consistent with our investment strategy. If our strategy were to change and these securities were impaired, we would recognize a write down in accordance with our stated policy. Additionally, it is possible that future information will become available about our current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value. No such charges were recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists. However, there would be no impact on equity at the end of the periods presented because any unrealized losses would have been already included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 41 Table of Contents Substantially the entire fixed maturity securities portfolio is investment grade.

Further, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and write downs of the value of certain securities could further reduce our profitability. In addition, a decrease in value of our investment portfolio could put our subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. If we were not at that time able to supplement our capital by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our ability to continue growing could be adversely affected. See further discussion in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment. GAAP requires deferred tax assets and liabilities (DTAs and DTLs, respectively) to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. For example, we have a DTA because the tax bases of our loss and LAE reserves are smaller than their book bases. Similarly, we have a DTL because the book basis of our capitalized software exceeds its tax basis. Carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely, and net operating losses (NOLs), which may be carried forward 20 years for losses incurred after 1998. A summary of the significant DTAs and DTLs relating to the Companys temporary differences and carryforwards is included in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, our DTAs total $117.9 million and our DTLs total $69.5 million, for a net DTA of $48.4 million. At December 31, 2005, our DTAs were $121.5 million and our DTLs were $65.3 million, for a net DTA of $56.2 million. The net DTAs are classified as an asset, Deferred income taxes, in the consolidated balance sheets. We are required to reduce DTAs (but not DTLs) by a valuation allowance to the extent that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that any DTAs will not be realized. Recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur. The determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment. In making this judgment, management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the DTAs will be realized. The Companys net deferred tax assets include a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward for regular federal corporate tax purposes of approximately $9.3 million, representing an unrealized tax benefit of $3.3 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $33.6 million, $75.8 million and $105.3 million at the end of the three preceding years, respectively. As a result of taxable income since 2002, our NOL has been fully utilized through December 31, 2006 except for the amount relating to 21st Century Insurance Company of the Southwest that is subject to the IRS separate return limitation year provisions. The remaining NOL expires as follows: $1.4 million in 2017; $1.1 million in 2018; $1.5 million in 2019; $3.2 million in 2020; and $2.1 million in 2021. Our ability to fully utilize the NOL of 21st of the Southwest and our other DTAs depends primarily on future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies. Because of the Companys profitable operating history and the availability of tax planning strategies, management believes it is reasonable to conclude that it is at least more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of all of our DTAs. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recognized at December 31, 2006. However, generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors, including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond our ability to control. Implementation of tax planning strategies to effect realization of our remaining NOL may require regulatory approvals, which although reasonably expected cannot be assured by management. Future operating losses could possibly jeopardize our ability to realize our other DTAs. Future unfavorable regulatory actions or operating losses would lead management to reach a different conclusion about the likelihood of realizing the DTAs and, if so, to recognize a valuation allowance at that time for some or all of the DTAs. 44 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) include premium taxes, advertising after it takes place, and other variable costs incurred with writing business. While our customers typically renew their policies numerous times and on average stay with us for over five years, these costs are deferred and amortized over the six month policy period in which the related premiums are earned. Management assesses the recoverability of DPAC on a quarterly basis. The assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period. We do not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs. Based on current indications, management believes that these costs are fully recoverable at December 31, 2006. The loss and LAE ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on expected ultimate ratios provided by our actuaries. While management believes that is a reasonable assumption, actual results could differ materially from such estimates. Property and Equipment At December 31, 2006, net property and equipment included $131.0 million in software, net of related accumulated depreciation. This amount represented 84.5% of total net property and equipment, with the remaining balance consisting of furniture and equipment, leasehold and building improvements, building, and land. Management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. During 2006, the Company reassessed an asset group comprised of capitalized software dedicated to the administration of certain policies and concluded that such assets were impaired. An impairment of $0.9 million, classified as other expense, was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006. Pension Cost The Company has a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which covers essentially all employees who have completed at least one year of service. The pension benefits under the qualified plan are based on employees compensation during all years of service. The Companys funding policy for the qualified plan is to make annual contributions as required by applicable regulations; employees may not make contributions to this plan. For certain key employees designated by the Board of Directors, the Company sponsors a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan. The supplemental plan benefits are based on years of service and compensation during the three highest of the last ten years of employment prior to retirement and are reduced by the benefit payable from the qualified pension plan and 50% of the social security benefit. Because the internal revenue code does not allow current deductions for advance funding of a non qualified plan, the Companys funding policy with respect to this plan is to make contributions as benefits become payable to participants. In September 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ("FAS 158"), which the Company was required to adopt effective December 31, 2006. FAS 158 requires the Company to (1) recognize the funded status of the defined benefit plans in its statement of financial position, (2) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, (3) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position and (4) disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligations. Adoption of FAS 158 had the effect of reducing stockholders equity by $14.2 million at December 31, 2006, as explained further in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of FAS 158 had no effect on the Companys compliance with its financial covenants. The Company makes a number of assumptions relating to its pension plans to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate, the expected long term return on plan assets (ROA) and the rate of future compensation increase. The effects of changes in these assumptions affect both the Companys earnings and its financial position. The earnings effects generally are accounted for initially as deferred actuarial gains or losses, which in turn prospectively affect the determination of the amortization component of net periodic pension cost. Changes in the discount rate and future compensation assumptions also affect the actuarial measurement of the plans projected benefit obligations, which in turn impacts the plans funded status and results in an increase or decrease in shareholders equity absent any offsetting changes in the fair value of plan assets. The effects of such changes in assumptions could be material to the Companys earnings and financial condition. 45 Table of Contents The effects of such changes in assumptions are complex but can be summarized as shown in the following table: Increase in Discount Rate Increase in Future Compensation Rate Increase in Assumed Return on Assets Effect on projected benefit obligation and funded status Decrease Increase None Effect on service cost Decrease in pension cost Increase in pension cost None Effect on interest cost Increase in pension cost Increase in pension cost None Effect on expected return on assets None None Decrease in pension cost Effect on amortization cost Decrease in pension cost Increase in pension cost Decrease in pension cost The discussion below illustrates the sensitivity of the pre tax pension measurements to hypothetical changes in assumptions, but is not intended to represent a prediction of the future performance of our defined benefit plans. Discount Rate Because by definition it is intended to be market sensitive, the discount rate assumption typically varies from year to year and is determined by developing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matched to our projected benefit costs. The weighted average discount rate assumption for determining net periodic pension cost is 5.9% for 2007, compared with 5.7% in 2006, 6.0% in 2005 and 6.1% in 2004. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate assumption for 2008 would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense for 2008 by approximately $0.7 million. Return on Assets The expected long term rate of return on assets is a weighted average expectation for the return on plan assets. The Company considers historical performance and current benchmarks to arrive at expected long term rates of return in each asset category. The Company utilizes consulting pension actuaries to perform stochastic modeling services to assist the Company in determining the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets, based on an assumption that 75% of the plan asset portfolio will be invested in equity securities, with the remainder invested in debt securities. Historical returns are not adjusted for purposes of performing the stochastic modeling. The long term ROA assumption for the Companys pension plans in 2007 is 8.5%, unchanged from 2006, 2005 and 2004. By way of comparison, the actual returns on plan assets were 13.6% in 2006, 7.3% in 2005 and 12.0% in 2004, representing a three year weighted average of 11.0%. Net periodic benefit cost was $9.2 million, $8.9 million, and $9.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and included expected return on plan assets of $8.4 million, $7.3 million, and $6.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets caused actuarial gains (losses) of approximately $5.4 million, ($1.0) million, and $2.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the expected ROA assumption would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense in 2008 by approximately $0.3 million. For every 2.5% that the actual pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2007, the Companys pension expense for 2008 would change by approximately $0.5 million. Future Compensation To develop the assumed rate of future compensation, the Company considers the historical compensation of the plan participants and future wage expectations taking into consideration inflation indicators such as the consumer price index. An increase or decrease of 1.0% in the expected rate of future compensation assumption would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense in 2008 by approximately $0.9 million. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Stock based Compensation Cost For periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share based payment transactions with employees in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (FAS) 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123). Under the provisions of FAS 123, we had elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We did not recognize in income any compensation expense for the fair value of stock options awarded to employees as all employee stock options were granted at the closing market price on the grant date. However, stock based employee compensation cost relating to restricted stock was recognized in the statements of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R. Unlike FAS 123, which was elective, FAS 123R requires that companies use a fair value method to value share based payments and recognize the related compensation expense in net earnings. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of the employee stock options. 46 Table of Contents The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective application method, and accordingly, financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this Form 10 K have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation under FAS 123R. The modified prospective application method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to stock based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006 and all previously granted, but unvested awards at January 1, 2006. The adoption of FAS 123R in 2006 resulted in additional stock based compensation cost of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which previously would have been only presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure. FAS 123R also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation, as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. No cumulative adjustment was necessary for prior year forfeitures as these were estimated in the Companys prior year pro forma financial statements. In addition, FAS 123R requires us to reflect the cash savings resulting from excess tax benefits (i.e., the benefit of the tax deduction for a share based payment that exceeds the recognized compensation cost for that award) in its consolidated financial statements as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior periods. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at December 31, 2006, was $8.7 million and the weighted average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. For grants made on or after January 1, 2006, the Company applied the non substantive vesting period approach, which requires recognition of compensation expense from the grant date to the earlier of the vesting date or the date retirement eligibility is achieved for awards with retirement eligibility options. The use of the non substantive vesting approach does not affect the overall amount of compensation expense recognized, but does accelerate the recognition of expense. This resulted in $0.7 million in accelerated vesting of awards incurred during the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, we recognized $1.4 million in stock based compensation expense in connection with the accelerated vesting of awards as part of an executive retention agreement. For the remaining portion of awards that were unvested and granted prior to January 1, 2006, we will continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach, and accordingly recognize the expense from the grant date to the earlier of the actual date of retirement or the vesting date. Calculating the fair value of stock option awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the stock price volatility. Volatility is a measure of stock price fluctuation in a given period. The objective of estimating volatility is to ascertain the assumption about expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining a price for an option. The Company is excluded from relying exclusively on the historical volatility of its publicly traded common stock as the Companys stock has been impacted by significant one time events. As such, the Company develops its volatility for each stock option grant by combining the volatility of its competitors in the Property & Casualty insurance industry. In addition to the volatility calculation, other assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock option awards involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, the computed fair value and resulting stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Furthermore, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. The 2006 grants had a weighed fair value of $4.99 that was derived using the Black Scholes model. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the weighed fair value to hypothetical changes in assumptions, but is not intended to represent a prediction of the future fair values. Actual weighted average assumption Weighted average assumption adjusted upward to: Weighted average fair value after upward adjustment Weighted average assumption adjusted downward to: Weighted average fair value after downward adjustment Weighted volatility assumption 29.40 % 31.40 % $ 5.24 27.40 % $ 4.75 Weighted dividend rate assumption 1.94 2.94 4.39 0.94 5.66 See additional discussion in Notes 2 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 158, which requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer benefit plans to (1) recognize the funded status of the defined benefit plans in its statement of financial position, (2) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, (3) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position and (4) disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs on credits, and transition asset or obligations. At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FAS 158, which had the effect of reducing stockholders equity by approximately $14.2 million. The adoption of FAS 158 did not have any effect on the Companys compliance with its financial covenants. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, that the implementation of FAS 157 will have on our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective for the Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on the financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FAS No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This interpretation will be effective January 1, 2007. We expect the adoption of FIN 48 will result in the recognition of a reduction of retained earnings of approximately $2.5 million effective January 1, 2007. Statement of Position 05 1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts (SOP 05 1), becomes effective January 1, 2007. SOP 05 1 provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. The SOP defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverage that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. We are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. This report contains statements that constitute forward looking information. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results or developments may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions concerning our potential expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections, and assumptions. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions at the time the statements are made. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10 K. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. In addition to market risk, we are exposed to other risks, including the credit risk related to the issuers of the financial instruments in which we invest, the underlying insurance risk related to our core business and the exposure of the personal automobile lines insurance business, as a regulated industry, to legal, legislative, judicial, political and regulatory action. Financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. The Company also obtained long term fixed rate financing as a means of increasing the statutory surplus of the Companys largest insurance subsidiary in 2002 and 2003. The following disclosure reflects estimated changes in value that may result from selected hypothetical changes in market rates and prices. Actual results may differ. Fixed maturity financial instruments Our cash flows from operations and short term cash position generally have been more than sufficient to meet our projected obligations for claim payments, which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business, tend to have an average duration of less than one year. As a result, it has been unnecessary for us to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies. For all of our fixed maturity securities, which comprises the majority of the Companys investment portfolio, we seek to provide for liquidity and diversification while maximizing income without sacrificing investment quality. The value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk where the value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio decreases as market interest rates increase, and conversely, when market interest rates decrease, the value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio increases. Duration is a common measure of the sensitivity of a fixed maturity securitys value to changes in interest rates. The higher the duration, the more sensitive a fixed maturity security is to market interest rate fluctuations. Effective duration also measures this sensitivity, but it takes into account call terms, as well as changes in remaining term, coupon rate, cash flow, and other items. Since fixed maturity securities with longer remaining terms to maturity tend to realize higher yields, the Companys investment philosophy typically resulted in a portfolio with an effective duration of over 6 years. Due to the changing interest rate environment in 2004, management, in consultation with the Investment Committee, targeted a lower duration for the Companys fixed maturity security portfolio to reduce the negative impact of potential increases in interest rates. As a result, the effective duration of the total fixed maturity portfolio declined from approximately 4.7 years at December 31, 2005 to 4.0 years at December 31, 2006. The graphical depiction of the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same credit quality with different maturities is usually referred to as a yield curve. Because the yield on U.S. Treasury securities is the base rate (or risk free rate) from which non government bond yields are normally benchmarked, the most commonly constructed yield curve is derived from the observation of prices and yields in the Treasury market. An upward sloping curve, where yield rises steadily as maturity increases, is referred to as a normal yield curve. The following table shows the carrying values of our fixed maturity securities, which are reported at fair value, and our debt, which is reported at amortized cost. The table also presents estimated fair values at adjusted market rates assuming a parallel 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, given the effective duration noted above, for the fixed maturity investment portfolio and a parallel 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates for the debt determined from a present value calculation. The following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market interest rate risk: AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS Carrying Value Estimated Carrying Value at Adjusted Market Rates/Prices Indicated Above Change in Value as a Percentage of Carrying Value December 31, 2006 Fixed maturity securities available for sale, at fair value $ 1,435.0 $ 1,379.3 (3.9 %) Debt, at amortized cost 115.9 121.9 5.3 The discussion above provides only a limited, point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of our fixed rate financial instruments. The actual impact of interest rate changes on our fixed maturity securities in particular may differ significantly from those shown, as the analysis assumes a parallel shift in market interest rates. The analysis also does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates. The difference between long term Treasury yields and short term Treasury yields are usually referred as the slope of the yield curve. If the spread between the long end of the curve, where maturities are high, and the short end of the curve, where maturities are low, narrows, the yield curve is said to be flattening. Conversely, if the spread between the long end of the curve and the short end of the curve widens, the yield curve is said to be steepening. If the yields on the long end of the curve fall below those of the short end of the curve, the yield curve is said to be inverted. 49 Table of Contents The analysis above assumes a parallel shift in interest rates. However, the curve may also steepen, flatten or become inverted. This type of behavior may affect certain sections of the curve in disproportionate amounts. For example, if short term Treasury yields rise and the yield curve flattens, fixed maturity instruments with short duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with longer duration. Conversely, if long term Treasury yields rise and the yield curve steepens, fixed maturity instruments with long duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with shorter duration. The following summarizes the effective duration distribution of our fixed maturity securities portfolio. Duration Ranges December 31, 2006 Below 1 1 to 3 3 to 5 5 to 7 7 to 10 10 to 20 Fair value percentage of fixed maturity securities portfolio 1.7% 22.0% 61.8% 13.3% 1.2% 0.0% Equity investments In an effort to enhance yield and provide some non correlated diversification to our fixed income portfolio, the Company has invested in equity securities. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company sold its publicly traded equity security portfolio and subsequently invested in a private equity portfolio. The Company committed $35 million to an AIGGIC managed fund of private equity investments and funded $14.4 million of the $35 million commitment in 2006. The value of these private equity investments are calculated on a quarterly basis, as AIGGIC consolidates the performance of each fund partner and each particular investment. The primary risk in this portfolio is event driven risk. This is managed via diversification across fund managers and styles, as well as by AIGGICs long history of experience in the asset class. The Company also has a small portion, $0.3 million, of its community related investment portfolio invested in a single private equity transaction. 50 Table of Contents

Our long term financial goals include achieving a 96% or lower combined ratio, 15% annual growth in premiums written, 15% return on stockholders equity, and strong financial ratings. Please refer to Item 1. Business for additional information on the Companys long term financial goals and a discussion of insurance terminology used throughout this document. National Expansion The Company is implementing a multi year strategy for national expansion to realize benefits from economies of scale, lower unit marketing costs due to the cost efficiency of buying advertising on a national basis, less dependency on any single market and the operating flexibility to focus resources on attractive markets and deemphasize less attractive markets. In execution of this strategy, 21st expanded its operations into the Midwest (2004); Texas (2005); Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania (second quarter of 2006); New Jersey (October 2006); and Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin (fourth quarter 2006). During 2006, the Company has increased the percentage of the U.S. personal auto market in which it operates from 34 percent to 60 percent. Year over year growth in direct premiums written in non California markets in 2006 was 77.3% versus 81.6% in 2005. Non California direct premiums written comprised 11.3% of our total direct premiums written in 2006, versus 6.2% in 2005. Continued implementation of our growth strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, judicial, regulatory, or legislative developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs. Highlights The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 % Change 06 vs.05 % Change 05 vs.04 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,370 $ 1,337,198 (2.3 )% 0.7 % Net premiums written 1,309,687 1,341,418 1,332,384 (2.4 ) 0.7 Net premiums earned 1,307,585 1,352,937 1,313,670 (3.4 ) 3.0 Net losses and LAE (920,846 ) (998,933 ) (993,841 ) (7.8 ) 0.5 Underwriting expenses (303,782 ) (284,334 ) (258,571 ) 6.8 10.0 Underwriting profit $ 82,957 $ 69,670 $ 61,258 19.1 13.7 Financial highlights for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: Total direct premiums written decreased 2.3% to $1,315.1 million in 2006, from $1,346.4 million and $1,337.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. California direct premiums written decreased 7.6% to $1,166.0 million in 2006, compared to $1,262.3 million and $1,290.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Non California direct premiums written increased 77.3% to $149.1 million in 2006, compared to $84.1 million and $46.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 consolidated combined ratio was 93.7%, versus 94.9% and 95.3% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 2006 was positively impacted by 4.0 points of favorable prior accident year loss and LAE reserve development in 2006, while 2005 was favorably impacted by 1.9 points of prior accident year development. 2004 was not impacted by prior accident year development. For 2006, 21sts insurance subsidiaries achieved underwriting profitability, but total direct premiums written declined for the year. The California market, which represented 88.7% of our total direct premiums written during 2006, has seen stable to declining rates from competitors and a reduced level of shopping behavior by consumers, which reduced our opportunities for profitable growth in this state. However, 21st realized 77.3% of growth in non California states during 2006 as a result of the Companys national expansion efforts. Our non California direct premiums written grew from 6.2% in 2005 to 11.3% of out total book of business in 2006. 28 Table of Contents The loss and LAE ratios of 70.5%, 73.8%, and 75.6% for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, have decreased since 2002 primarily due to favorable loss development, improvements in our pricing and underwriting methods and the favorable impact of declining frequency trends and moderate claim severity trends. The underwriting expense to net premiums earned ratio increased to 23.2% in 2006 from 21.1% and 19.7% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. These underwriting expense ratio increases are primarily the result of expenses associated with the Companys national expansion efforts and the 2006 recognition of stock based compensation, which were partially offset by deferred policy acquisition costs. The 2005 increase was primarily due to our investments in the geographic expansion strategy, costs associated with the conversion to our new technology platform, and facility and support costs. The increase in 2004 consists primarily of increased advertising costs, additional sales workforce costs, and facility and support costs to improve service and support the Texas service center. Net income increased 11.2% to $97.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or $1.13 per basic share, compared to $87.4 million, or $1.02 per basic share, and $88.2 million, or $1.03 per basic share for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 results include prior year favorable reserve development totaling $51.9 million, versus $25.1 million and $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The recognition of stock based compensation resulted from our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). FAS 123R requires the recognition of compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the estimated fair value of the employee share based options. See Critical Accounting Estimates Stock Based Compensation Cost for further discussion. Stock based compensation classified as underwriting expense for 2006 was $6.1 million. In July 2006, the California Department of Insurance (the CDI) obtained approval for changes to regulations (the Auto Rating Factor Regulations) relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating. Because the new Auto Rating Factor Regulations require every personal auto insurance company operating in California to make a class plan and rate filing in the third quarter of 2006, competitive rate levels have changed and consumer shopping behavior may increase in the future. As of this date, the Company has filed for an overall rate decrease in California of approximately 5% of premium. The CDI approved the Companys class plan and rate filings. The new rates took effect January 3, 2007. Most of the Companys main competitors have also had approved overall rate decreases of varying amounts, while some have not substantially changed overall rate levels while attempting to comply with the new regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these changes, which could have either a materially favorable or materially adverse impact on the Company. All rate changes and class plan filings must be approved by the CDI. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations (the Rate Approval Regulations), affecting personal auto, homeowners and most lines of commercial property and casualty insurance written in California. The regulations become effective on April 3, 2007. If newly elected insurance commissioner does not modify, suspend or withdraw the regulations before they become effective, an industry lawsuit could be brought to challenge the regulations as contrary to current law. Also, the Company could consider bringing its own legal action, once the regulations are applied to it. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Proposal for Offer On January 24, 2007, the majority owner, AIG, made a proposal to acquire the remaining shares of the Company common stock it does not own. The proposal is subject to several conditions, including the approval of the transaction by a Special Committee of the Companys Board of Directors who are independent of AIG. The proposal could have a negative impact on the Companys ability to carry out its business plans. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Streamlining of Operations On February 26, 2007, the Company announced it expects to incur approximately $3.7 million in severance costs during the first quarter of 2007 in connection with a four percent reduction of its total work force. Non GAAP Measures Information concerning premiums written, underwriting profit, combined ratios, and statutory surplus have been presented to enhance readers understanding of the Companys operations. These are widely used financial measures in the insurance industry that happen not to have formal definitions currently under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Premiums written represent the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period. We use premiums written as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period. The most directly comparable GAAP measure, premiums earned, represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as income on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. 29 Table of Contents Underwriting profit (loss) consists of net premiums earned less losses from claims, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. 21st believes that underwriting profit (loss) provides investors with financial information that is not only meaningful, but critically important to understanding the results of property and casualty insurance operations. The results of operations of a property and casualty insurance company include three components: underwriting profit (loss), net investment income and realized capital gains (losses). Without disclosure of underwriting profit (loss), it is difficult to determine how successful an insurance company is in its core business activity of assessing and underwriting risk, as including investment income and realized capital gains (losses) in the results of operations without disclosing underwriting profit (loss) can mask underwriting losses. Statutory surplus represents equity as of the end of a fiscal period for the Companys insurance subsidiaries, determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Stockholders equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to statutory surplus. The reconciliations of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are located in the following: premiums written and underwriting profit are located in the Results of Operations and statutory surplus is located in Liquidity and Capital Resources. These financial measures are not intended to replace, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures. See Results of Operations for more details as to our overall and personal auto lines results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results The following table reconciles our personal auto lines underwriting profit to our consolidated results of operations: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 % Change 06 vs.05 % Change 05 vs.04 Personal auto lines underwriting profit $ 83,708 $ 71,995 $ 63,972 16.3 % 12.5 % Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff, underwriting loss (751 ) (2,325 ) (2,714 ) (67.7 ) (14.3 ) Net investment income 68,493 69,096 58,831 (0.9 ) 17.4 Other income 638 367 73.8 N/M1 Net realized investment (losses) gains (1,429 ) (3,272 ) 10,831 (56.3 ) (130.2 ) Other expense (1,860 ) (410 ) N/M1 N/M1 Interest and fees expense (7,348 ) (8,019 ) (8,627 ) (8.4 ) (7.0 ) Provision for income taxes (44,223 ) (40,006 ) (34,068 ) 10.5 17.4 Net income $ 97,228 $ 87,426 $ 88,225 11.2 (0.9 ) Basic earnings per share $ 1.13 $ 1.02 $ 1.03 10.7 (1.0 ) Diluted earnings per share $ 1.12 $ 1.02 $ 1.03 10.2 (1.0 ) Underwriting results above include the effect of prior years reserve redundancy recorded in the current year. The following table summarizes losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) incurred, net of applicable reinsurance, for the periods indicated: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net losses and LAE: Current accident year $ 972,743 $ 1,024,073 $ 993,948 Prior accident years Personal auto lines (52,648 ) (27,473 ) (2,936 ) Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 751 2,333 2,831 Total prior years redundancy recorded in current year (51,897 ) (25,140 ) (105 ) Total net losses and LAE incurred $ 920,846 $ 998,933 $ 993,843 1 Ratio is not meaningful. 30 Table of Contents We perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of carried unpaid losses and LAE. These estimates depend on many assumptions about the outcome of future events. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and LAE will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and materially differ from our unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2006, 2005, or 2004. In the future, if the unpaid losses and LAE develop redundancies or deficiencies, such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact, respectively, on future results of operations. See Critical Accounting Estimates Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for additional discussion of our reserving policy. Personal Auto Lines Underwriting Results Personal automobile insurance is our primary line of business. Non California vehicles accounted for 11.3%, 6.2%, and 3.5% of our direct premiums written in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This increase is due to our ongoing national expansion program, which includes marketing in non California states. The Company currently plans to expand into additional states to further its national expansion strategy. The following table presents the components of our personal auto lines underwriting profit and the components of the combined ratio for the past three years: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Personal Auto Lines % Change % Change Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 06 vs.05 05 vs.04 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,371 $ 1,337,190 (2.3 )% 0.7 % Net premiums written $ 1,309,687 $ 1,341,419 $ 1,332,375 (2.4 ) 0.7 Net premiums earned $ 1,307,585 $ 1,352,928 $ 1,313,551 (3.4 ) 3.0 Net losses and LAE (920,095 ) (996,599 ) (991,008 ) (7.7 ) 0.6 Underwriting expenses (303,782 ) (284,334 ) (258,571 ) 6.8 10.0 Underwriting profit $ 83,708 $ 71,995 $ 63,972 16.3 12.5 Ratios: Loss and LAE ratio 70.4 % 73.7 % 75.4 % (3.3 ) (1.7 ) Underwriting expense ratio 23.2 21.0 19.7 2.2 1.3 Combined ratio 93.6 % 94.7 % 95.1 % (1.1 ) (0.4 ) The following table reconciles our personal auto lines direct premiums written to net premiums earned: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 Direct premiums written $ 1,315,107 $ 1,346,371 $ 1,337,190 Ceded premiums written (5,420 ) (4,952 ) (4,815 ) Net premiums written 1,309,687 1,341,419 1,332,375 Net change in unearned premiums (2,102 ) 11,509 (18,824 ) Net premiums earned $ 1,307,585 $ 1,352,928 $ 1,313,551 Direct premiums written decreased 2.3% in 2006, while increasing 0.7% in 2005 and 9.3% in 2004; less than our long term goal of 15%. Market conditions in California were somewhat less favorable for growth in 2006 than in the preceding two years. Since 2004, we have met our profitability goals, posting our best combined ratios since 1999 and our direct premiums written grew 9.3% in 2004 despite an increasingly competitive California marketing climate. As discussed in the Highlights, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating in July 2006. It is not possible at this time to predict the impact of these changes, which could have either a favorable or adverse impact on the Company. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations, subsequently amended in October of 2006 and approved in January of 2007 with an effective date of April 3, 2007. The regulations could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys California results. See further discussion of both regulations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. As the Company proceeds with its national expansion, we believe that achieving our long term growth goal will steadily depend less on the California marketplace. The Companys national expansion efforts will provide us with flexibility to use combinations of local and national marketing media, as appropriate, and the ability to focus our marketing expenditures and Company resources on attractive markets, while minimizing costs in less attractive markets. The declines in the loss and LAE ratios for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, of 3.3 points, 1.7 points, and 3.1 points, respectively, are primarily due to the effect of favorable development related to prior accident years and lower accident frequency. The effects on the net loss and LAE ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were as follows: 4.0 points ($52.6 million) of favorable reserve development in 2006, 2.0 points ($27.5 million) of favorable reserve development in 2005, and 0.2 points ($2.9 million) of favorable reserve development in 2004. For additional discussion of these estimates, please see Item 1 of this report under the heading Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. In general, changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted, usually in conjunction with our quarterly actuarial review. 31 Table of Contents The underwriting expense ratios to net premiums earned increased for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The 2006 increase was primarily due to our investments in the Companys national expansion efforts and the 2006 recognition of stock based compensation, partially offset by an increase in deferred policy acquisition costs. The 2005 increase was primarily due to our investments in the geographic expansion strategy, costs associated with the conversion to our new technology platform, and facility and support costs. The increase in 2004 consists primarily of increased advertising costs, additional sales workforce costs, and facility and support costs to improve service and support the Texas service center. Homeowner and Earthquake Lines in Runoff Results We have not written any earthquake policies since 1994 and exited the voluntary homeowner insurance business in 2002. Underwriting results of the homeowner and earthquake lines, which are in runoff, include losses and LAE incurred of $0.8 million, $2.3 million, and $2.8 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, of which the earthquake lines accounted for $0.1 million, $0.4 million, and $2.2 million, respectively. Net Investment Income We utilize a conservative investment philosophy. Substantially the entire fixed maturity securities portfolio is investment grade, having a weighted average Standard & Poors credit quality of AA. No derivatives are held in our investment portfolio and there were no publicly traded equity securities at December 31, 2006. We previously held publicly traded equities, but sold them in the first quarter of 2006, lowering the risk and yield of the overall investment portfolio. The components of net investment income were as follows: Net Investment Income AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 2004 Interest on fixed maturity securities $ 67,449 $ 63,122 $ 57,729 Interest on cash and cash equivalents 1,272 1,188 585 Interest on other long term investments 63 Dividends on equity securities 811 5,848 1,484 Total investment income 69,595 70,159 59,798 Investment expense (1,102 ) (1,063 ) (967 ) Net investment income $ 68,493 $ 69,096 $ 58,831 The fixed maturity securities portfolio comprised 99%, 97%, and 97% of the total investment portfolio at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The average annual yields on fixed maturity securities were as follows: Average Annual Yields on Fixed Maturity Securities Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Pre tax fixed maturity securities 4.6% 4.6% 4.4% After tax fixed maturity securities 3.3% 3.3% 3.2% At December 31, 2006, $379.4 million, or 26.4%, of our total fixed maturity securities at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds, compared to 23.1% at December 31, 2005, with the remainder, representing 73.6% of the portfolio, invested in taxable securities, compared to 76.9% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, no investments were rated below investment grade. The net realized (losses) gains on investments were as follows: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Gross realized gains $ 1,953 $ 6,574 $ 14,145 Gross realized losses (2,603 ) (9,482 ) (2,465 ) Net realized (losses) gains $ (650 ) $ (2,908 ) $ 11,680 Our policy is to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, all investments for other than temporary impairment when the fair value of a security falls below its cost or amortized cost, based on all relevant facts and circumstances. No such impairments were recorded in 2006, 2005, or 2004 (see discussion under Critical Accounting Estimates Investments). 32 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income of $0.6 million and $0.4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, consists of interest income relating to claims with taxing authorities. Other expense of $1.8 million in 2006 consists of the following: a $0.9 million impairment charge for vacated space in our headquarters in Woodland Hills, California, and a $0.9 million write off of software projects due to impairment. Other expense of $0.4 million in 2005 also relates to an impairment charge for vacated space in our headquarters. No other income or expense was reported in 2004. FINANCIAL CONDITION Investments and cash were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. The Company sold its investments in equity securities during the first quarter of 2006, with the proceeds primarily reinvested in fixed maturity securities. The Company did not hold any publicly traded equity securities at December 31, 2006. However, we executed a $35 million funding commitment for a private equity investment program during the second quarter of 2006, as described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company funded $14.4 million of the commitment in 2006. At December 31, 2006, 26.2% of our total investments were in tax exempt, fixed income securities, compared to 22.3% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, investment grade securities comprised substantially all of the fair value of our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2006, no investments were rated below investment grade. The Company also has unrated, community investments representing 1.4% of total investments. These investments have been made in an effort to provide housing and other services to economically disadvantaged communities. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Increased advertising, sales and customer service costs through December 31, 2006 contributed to a $3.7 million increase in deferred policy acquisitions costs (DPAC) to $63.6 million, compared to $59.9 million at December 31, 2005. The Companys DPAC is estimated to be fully recoverable (see Critical Accounting Estimates Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs). The following table summarizes unpaid losses and LAE, gross and net of applicable reinsurance, with respect to our lines of business: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS 2006 2005 Years Ended December 31, Gross Net Gross Net Unpaid losses and LAE: Personal auto lines $ 480,731 $ 475,261 $ 521,528 $ 516,849 Homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff 1,538 808 2,307 1,369 Total $ 482,269 $ 476,069 $ 523,835 $ 518,218 The following analysis provides a reconciliation of the activity in the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 At beginning of year: Reserve for losses and LAE, gross of reinsurance $ 523,835 $ 495,542 $ 438,323 Reinsurance recoverable (5,617 ) (4,645 ) (8,964 ) Reserve for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance 518,218 490,897 429,359 Losses and LAE incurred, net of reinsurance: Current year 972,743 1,024,073 993,946 Prior years (51,897 ) (25,140 ) (105 ) Total 920,846 998,933 993,841 Losses and LAE paid, net of reinsurance: Current year 662,036 684,474 642,664 Prior years 300,959 287,138 289,639 Total 962,995 971,612 932,303 At end of year: Reserve for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance 476,069 518,218 490,897 Reinsurance recoverable 6,200 5,617 4,645 Reserve for losses and LAE, gross of reinsurance $ 482,269 $ 523,835 $ 495,542 At December 31, 2006, gross unpaid losses and LAE decreased $41.6 million, primarily due to a reserve decrease of $40.8 million in the personal auto lines as a result of $52.6 million of favorable loss development related to prior accident years recorded during the year ended December 31, 2006 and a decline in the number of insured vehicles. The gross unpaid losses and LAE in the homeowner and earthquake lines decreased $0.8 million as the result of continued runoff activity (see Critical Accounting Estimates Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses for a description of the Companys reserving process). 33 Table of Contents Debt of $115.9 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $128.0 million at December 31, 2005, consists of $16.0 million of capital lease obligations and $99.9 million Senior Notes, net of discount (see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in debt of $12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 is primarily attributable to principal payments on the capital leases. Stockholders equity and book value per share increased to $898.5 million and $10.39, respectively, at December 31, 2006, compared to $830.0 million and $9.66 at December 31, 2005. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to net income of $97.2 million, stock based compensation cost of $10.4 million, and $5.7 million of proceeds from exercised stock options. This was partially offset by dividends to stockholders of $27.6 million, a decrease of $14.2 million due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, as disclosed in Recent Accounting Pronouncements, and an increase in net unrealized losses on available for sale investments of $3.5 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Holding Company Our holding companys main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries, borrowing from our primary insurance subsidiary, and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities. Apart from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock grants to employees, the effects of which have not been significant, we have not issued any equity securities since 1998 when AIG exercised its warrants to purchase 16 million shares of common stock for cash of $145.6 million. Our insurance subsidiaries did not pay any dividends to our holding company from 2001 to 2004 due to the previous uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries in California, which was resolved in 2004. Our primary insurance subsidiary, 21st Century Insurance Company, declared and paid a $110.0 million dividend in December 2006. On November 30, 2005, the CDI permitted an amendment to a term loan line that increased the available amount from $40 million to $150 million that our insurance subsidiary, 21st Century Insurance Company, can loan to our holding company. The term loan line had a zero balance at December 31, 2006. See further information in the Notes to Condensed Financial Information of Registrant. Effective December 31, 2003, the California Department of Insurance approved an intercompany lease whereby 21st Century Insurance Company leases certain computer software from our holding company. The monthly lease payment, currently $0.8 million, started in January 2004 and has been subject to upward adjustments based on the cost incurred by the holding company to enhance the software. Our holding companys significant cash obligations over the next several years consist of the following: Ongoing costs to enhance our computer software; Implementing the Companys geographic growth strategy; The repayment of the $100 million principal on the Senior Notes due in 2013; Related interest on the Senior Notes above; and Any dividends to stockholders that our directors may declare. We expect to be able to meet those obligations from sources of cash currently available (i.e., cash and investments at the holding company, which totaled $42.1 million at December 31, 2006, dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries, payments received from the intercompany lease, and borrowing from our primary insurance subsidiary), or additional funds obtainable from the capital markets. The effective California state income tax rate applicable to dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries is approximately 1.8%, or 1.2% net of federal benefit. Our primary insurance subsidiary could pay up to approximately $124.0 million in 2007 as dividends to the holding company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance Subsidiaries We have achieved underwriting profits in our core auto insurance operations since 2001 and have thereby enhanced our liquidity. Our cash flows from operations and short term cash position generally are more than sufficient to meet obligations for claim payments, which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business tend to have an average duration of less than a year. Our underwriting results are impacted by rate changes. Although in the past years we have been successful in gaining California regulatory approval for rate changes, there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate changes that may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends. 34 Table of Contents As discussed in the Highlights, in July 2006, the CDI issued changes to regulations relating to automobile insurance rating factors, particularly concerning territorial rating. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate timing or impact of these changes, which could have either a materially favorable or materially adverse impact on the Company. Also in July 2006, the CDI proposed new amended rate approval regulations, subsequently amended in October of 2006, could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys California results. The regulations become effective April 3, 2007. If the newly elected insurance commissioner does not modify, suspend or withdraw the regulations before they become effective, an industry lawsuit could be brought to challenge the regulations as contrary to current law. Also, the Company could consider bringing its own legal action, once the regulations are applied to it. See further discussion of both regulations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Also, in the event of adverse claims results, we could be forced to liquidate investments to pay claims, possibly during unfavorable market conditions, which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments. Adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries earnings or cash flows, which in turn, could negatively impact our liquidity. The NAIC employs a risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurance companies that establishes recommended minimum capital requirements. The formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics, as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure, investment policies, reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors. Based on the formula adopted by the NAIC, the Company has calculated a combined Company Action Level risk based capital requirement of $172.9 million for its insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006. Each of the insurance companies statutory surplus exceeded their respective level of minimum required capital. As of December 31, 2006, our insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of $771.0 million compared to $704.7 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in statutory surplus was primarily due to statutory net income of $124.5 million and a decrease in nonadmitted assets of $64.2 million, partially offset by dividends to the Parent of $110.0 million and a $15.6 million decrease in the deferred income tax asset. The following table reconciles stockholders equity to statutory surplus. December 31, 2006 2005 Stockholders equity GAAP $ 898,549 $ 829,972 Condensed adjustments to reconcile GAAP shareholders equity to statutory surplus: Net book value of fixed assets under capital leases (20,373 ) (24,185 ) Deferred gain under capital lease transactions (79 ) (914 ) Capital lease obligation 15,985 28,074 Nonadmitted portion of net deferred tax assets (17,419 ) (34,936 ) Difference in net deferred tax assets reported under Statutory Accounting Principles 24,200 38,544 Intercompany receivables (11,488 ) (57,683 ) Fixed assets (22,955 ) (22,492 ) Equity in non insurance entities (47,006 ) 26,798 Net unrealized losses on investments 17,881 10,788 Deferred policy acquisition costs (63,581 ) (59,939 ) Pension related liabilities (assets) 15,648 (14,126 ) Other prepaid expenses (14,195 ) (11,049 ) Other, net (4,158 ) (4,181 ) Statutory surplus $ 771,009 $ 704,671 The net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio, which shows a companys premium growth capacity and is required to be below 3.0 by the insurance regulators, was 1.7 at December 31, 2006, compared to 1.9 at December 31, 2005. 35 Table of Contents Cash Flows Our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents were as follows: AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 06 vs.05 Increase/(Decrease) 05 vs.04 Increase/(Decrease) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities $ 116,270 $ 160,261 $ 203,356 $ (43,991 ) $ (43,095 ) Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities (97,395 ) (104,612 ) (214,290 ) $ 7,217 $ 109,678 Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities (35,544 ) (21,678 ) (19,379 ) $ (13,866 ) $ (2,299 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (16,669 ) $ 33,971 $ (30,313 ) $ (50,640 ) $ 64,284 Operating Activities Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decline in direct premiums collected resulting from the decline in premiums written and an increase in taxes paid as a result of the utilization of the carryforward of net operating losses during 2006. This was partially offset by decreases in loss and LAE payments. Also, while underwriting expenses and policy acquisition costs increased over the prior year, cash outflows for those expenses decreased slightly due to the increase in unpaid other liabilities of $14.0 million which deferred payment of expenditures incurred in connection with our national expansion efforts. Investing Activities Our cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales, maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities. Our investment objective is to maintain a low level of risk and to preserve principal by investing in high quality, investment grade securities while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements. Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities increased due to a $1.4 million decrease in net acquisitions (purchases, net of maturities, calls and sales) of investments primarily as a result of the redeployment of cash equivalents and a $5.8 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities decreased due to the doubling of the quarterly dividend since the prior year from $0.04 per share to $0.08 per share, resulting in a $13.9 million increase in dividends paid, and a $1.2 million increase in debt payments, partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in cash receipts provided by stock option exercises. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS We have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Certain contractual obligations, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. 36 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding Senior Notes. Payments Due by Period AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS Total 2007 2008 through 2009 2010 through 2011 Remaining years after 2011 Senior notes $ 141.3 $ 5.9 $ 11.8 $ 11.8 $ 111.8 Capital lease obligations 16.7 14.9 1.3 0.5 Debt 158.0 20.8 13.1 12.3 111.8 Operating leases 2 154.2 26.1 41.3 35.8 51.0 Other long term commitments 2.2 0.7 0.8 0.5 0.2 Future pension benefit payments 3 72.1 3.3 8.0 11.1 49.7 Expected loss and LAE payments, net of reinsurance 476.0 322.2 140.0 11.6 2.2 Total4 $ 862.5 $ 373.1 $ 203.2 $ 71.3 $ 214.9 The table above excludes periodic contributions to pension plans, which are discussed below, and commitments for investment purchases discussed in Transactions with Related Parties. The capital lease obligations above resulted from a sale leaseback transaction and an auto capital lease transaction (see further discussion of these items in Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We have no material purchase obligations or other on or off balance sheet long term liabilities or obligations at December 31, 2006 (see discussion about variable interest entities in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our primary insurance subsidiary is responsible for making payments on both the capital lease obligations and most of the operating lease obligations. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time. Total contributions to the plans were $0.9 million, $10.0 million and $2.7 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. For the past several years we have followed the practice of contributing sufficient amounts to the qualified defined benefit pension plan to meet or exceed statutory funding requirements, without exceeding the maximum amount that would be deductible for corporate income tax purposes, and while maintaining plan assets at a level at least equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. The amount and timing of future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan depends on a number of unpredictable factors including statutory funding requirements, the market performance of the plans assets, cash requirements for benefit payments to retirees, and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations. Contributions to our non qualified defined benefit pension plan generally are limited to amounts needed to make benefit payments to retirees, which are expected to total approximately $0.9 million in 2007. It is managements belief that the total net loss and LAE reserve amount of $476.0 million at December 31, 2006 is adequate to cover unpaid losses and LAE as of December 31, 2006. The amount and timing of the reserve payments may be subject to the outcome of future events, such as changes in medical and repair costs, as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims. The variability of the ultimate settlement amount is likely to increase as the time between the occurrence and settlement of the claim is increased. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We currently have no letters of credit, no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value, and no obligations under any derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company has no material retained interests in assets transferred to any unconsolidated entity (see further discussion in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). However, 21st Century Insurance Group has issued guarantees on behalf of its insurance subsidiaries related to the capital lease obligations described above. Our Board of Directors has made a commitment to invest a portion of policyholder surplus in economically disadvantaged communities. In connection with this commitment, the Company has guaranteed 11.1%, or $42.2 million, of a warehouse financing agreement. The Company has also committed $20.1 million for other community investment purposes. These commitments, which do not significantly impact the Companys liquidity or capital, are further discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Includes amounts due under long term software license agreements of approximately $23.8 million. 3 Includes benefit payments through 2015. 4 Purchase commitments of $0.2 million were excluded from the summary, as they are not material. 37 Table of Contents TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES Several subsidiaries of AIG together own approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock and four of the eleven members of our Board of Directors, including our Chairman, are current or former officers and employees of AIG or its subsidiaries. Since 1995, the Company has entered into transactions with AIG subsidiaries, including reinsurance agreements, corporate insurance coverage, and investment management and investment accounting. Reinsurance Agreements The Company has a catastrophe reinsurance agreement for the comprehensive portion of its auto physical damage lines that is provided by three participating entities, two of which are AIG subsidiaries. Together they reinsure any covered event up to $45.0 million in excess of $20.0 million. This coverage was renewed effective January 1, 2006 and 2007 (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Total premiums ceded to AIG subsidiaries were $1.0 million, $1.0 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Total reinsurance recoverables, net of payables, from AIG subsidiaries were $0.4 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corporate Insurance Coverage The Company has obtained the following corporate insurance policies from AIG subsidiaries: Workers compensation insurance General liability insurance Property insurance Umbrella excess insurance Fiduciary liability insurance Fidelity insurance Auto insurance Employment practices liability insurance Errors and omissions insurance was carried with AIG through September 30, 2005. Total expense attributable to AIG corporate insurance coverages was $3.7 million, $2.9 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31,2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Investment management and investment accounting In October 2003, as a result of a competitive bidding process, we entered into an agreement with AIG Global Investment Corp. (AIGGIC) to provide investment management and investment accounting services. The fees are determined as a percentage of the average invested asset balance and are classified with net investment income. This agreement was approved by the CDI. Investment management and accounting expense was $1.1 million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In June 2006, the Company executed a $35 million funding commitment for a private equity investment program, which is managed by AIGGIC. In the event that we do not respond to a capital call during the investment term, the General Partner of the fund (GP) may apply the following default provisions: withhold 50% of distributions due to us at the time of the default and 50% of future distributions due to the Company; hold the Company liable for fund expenses above and beyond investments made by us (with the right of offset); terminate our Limited Partner status and not allow it any further investments; or charge interest on the defaulted capital commitment amount and fees at LIBOR + 4% (with the right of offset). However, the GP may choose not to designate the Company a defaulting limited partner and waive the default provisions. The investment term ends after the underlying investments are liquidated, but in no event is longer than 10 years. Multiple investments are expected to be purchased and liquidated over the investment term. The Company funded $14.4 million of the commitment in 2006. Software and data processing Through December 31, 2004, the Company utilized certain third party software and data processing monitoring tools under an agreement negotiated by AIG. Since January 1, 2005, the Company has negotiated its own contracts, and no longer incurs any software or data processing costs with AIG subsidiaries. Charges by AIG for software and data processing were $0.3 million in 2004. There was no expense in either 2005 or 2006. 38 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are essential to understanding Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and Change in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The following is a summary of the more critical accounting estimates. In each area, we have discussed the assumptions most important in the estimation process. We have used the best information available to estimate the related items involved. Actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key assumptions could change future valuations and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses The estimated liabilities for losses and LAE include estimates of the ultimate resolution for known claims reported on or prior to the balance sheet dates, estimates of losses for claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of expenses for investigating, adjusting and settling all incurred claims. Amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. The estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events, such as changes in medical and repair costs, as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the variability of the ultimate settlement amount is likely to increase as the time between the occurrence and settlement of the claim increased. The methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually monitored, reviewed, and updated. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating income on a dollar for dollar basis. For example, an upward revision of $1 million in the estimated recorded liability for unpaid losses and LAE would decrease underwriting profit, and pre tax income, by the same $1 million amount. Conversely, a downward revision of $1 million would increase pre tax income by the same $1 million amount. It is managements belief that the reserves for losses and LAE are adequate to cover unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2006. While we perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of established unpaid losses and LAE reserves, there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and LAE will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and possibly differ materially from our unpaid losses and LAE recorded at December 31, 2006. In the future, if the unpaid losses and LAE develop redundancies or deficiencies, such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact, respectively, on future results of operations. Because these are unknown future events, there is uncertainty in the Companys estimates of ultimate losses and LAE. This uncertainty comes from various factors, both positive and negative, that may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns, changes in regulatory and legal environment, and inflation rates. The Company does not make a specific provision for these uncertainties; however, they are considered in establishing the reserves by analyzing historical patterns and trends. The process of estimating unpaid losses and LAE begins with the review of the actual claims experience, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, mix of business, and changes in certain other factors such as weather and recent tort activity that may affect the loss and LAE ratio. Based on this review, our actuaries prepare several point estimates of unpaid losses and LAE for each of the coverages, and they use their experience and judgment to arrive at an overall actuarial point estimate of the unpaid losses and LAE for that coverage. Meetings are held with appropriate departments to discuss significant issues as a result of the review. This process culminates in a reserve meeting to review the unpaid losses and LAE. The basis for carried unpaid losses and LAE is the overall actuarial point estimate. Other relevant internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions, changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying policy pricing, exposure and policy forms, claims handling, and geographic distribution shifts. As a result of the meeting, unpaid losses and LAE are finalized and we record quarterly changes in unpaid losses and LAE for each of our coverages. The overall change in our unpaid losses and LAE is based on the sum of these coverage level changes. 39 Table of Contents The point estimate methods include the use of several commonly accepted actuarial methods utilizing paid and incurred loss histories, claim frequency and severity, and expected loss ratios. The incurred loss development method analyzes historical case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserves) development to estimate ultimate losses. The Company applies loss development factors against case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate losses. The paid loss development method is similar to the incurred loss development method except only paid losses are used. The claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate ultimate claim counts. The Company applies these development factors against claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate claim counts. Severity is the amount of loss per claim. The average severity method analyzes historical severity development to calculate an ultimate average cost per claim. From this, the ultimate severity can be estimated. The claim count development method coupled with the average severity method also provides useful information regarding frequency and inflationary trends that the Company believes is useful in setting reserves. In states with little operating history the Companys experience is supplemented with industry statistics. The Company uses similar methods for LAE. The Company estimates the loss IBNR reserves as the difference between its projection of ultimate losses and the sum of the payments and case reserves for losses. Quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration, including managerial judgment, to assure management satisfaction that the overall unpaid losses and LAE are adequate to meet projected losses. For example, in property damage coverages, repair cost trends by geographic region vary significantly. These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends that are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the loss costs recognized. Judgment is required in analyzing the appropriateness of the various methods and factors to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such prior trends. For example, changes in limits distributions or development in the most recent accident months would require more judgment. We do not believe disclosure of specific indicated point estimates as calculated by the various methods would be meaningful. Any one actuarial point estimate is based on a particular series of judgments and assumptions of the actuary. Another actuary may make different assumptions, and therefore reach a different point estimate. There is a potential for significant variation in ultimate development of unpaid losses and LAE. Most automobile claims are reported within two to three months whereas the estimate of ultimate severities exhibits greater variability at the same maturity. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development and there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity Analysis The Company uses numerous assumptions in determining its best estimates of reserves for losses and LAE for each coverage of the personal auto business. If actual experience differs from key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss and LAE reserves. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on the loss and LAE reserve position of using alternative loss cost trend or loss development factor assumptions rather than those actually used in determining the best estimates in the year end loss and LAE reserve analyses for 2006. The analysis addresses the personal auto business in California for which a material deviation to the Companys overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible, and uses what the Company believes is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve development will be consistent with either the original or the adjusted loss cost trend or loss development assumptions, or that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not materially affect reserve development for a particular coverage. After evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior years since 1994, in Managements judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year end 2006 loss and LAE reserve analysis will range from negative 13% to positive six percent, or approximately 12% lower and seven percent higher than the assumptions utilized in the year end 2006 reserve analysis. These changes in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately an $84 million decrease or a $47 million increase in the loss and LAE reserves. It should be emphasized that these deviations are not considered the highest possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is considered by the Company to reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. The assumed loss development factors are also a key assumption. After evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since 1999, in Managements judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will range from approximately 1.6 percent lower than those actually utilized in the year end 2006 loss and LAE reserve analysis to approximately 0.8 percent higher than those actually utilized. If the loss development factor assumptions were reduced by 1.6 percent and increased by 0.8 percent, the loss and LAE reserves would decrease by approximately $86 million under the lower assumptions or increase by approximately $42 million under the higher assumptions. Generally, historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate by more than the amounts illustrated above. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting claims. Thus, there is the potential for variations greater than the amounts cited above, either negatively or positively. 40 Table of Contents The primary responsibility of an insurance company is paying claims of its policyholders in a fair and timely manner. Having adequate loss reserves, with special consideration for the upside potential of claims not yet paid is central to this responsibility. The company experienced significant losses from the 1995 Northridge earthquake and the subsequent reopening of claims resulting from SB 1899. The costs related to both the original event and SB 1899 illustrate the uncertainty that can result from estimating loss reserves. The number and severity of claims far exceeded initial estimates of losses. The two Northridge events point to the importance of the adequacy of loss reserves and the inherent estimating uncertainties of the loss reserving process. Investments Investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on managements intentions at inception with respect to either holding or selling the securities. The classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise, whereas for available for sale securities they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized. The fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources. The cost of investment securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. We are obligated to assess, at each reporting date, whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities. In general, a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment based upon the following criteria: Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par, amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time (nine months or longer), The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization, and The probability of non realization of a full recovery on our investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events. For investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events, where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity, declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary. Where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary, such as when it is determined that an issuer is unable to repay the entire principal, a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value. The determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment. The Companys intent is to hold all of its fixed securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity as long as these securities continue to be consistent with our investment strategy. If our strategy were to change and these securities were impaired, we would recognize a write down in accordance with our stated policy. Additionally, it is possible that future information will become available about our current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value. No such charges were recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists. However, there would be no impact on equity at the end of the periods presented because any unrealized losses would have been already included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 41 Table of Contents Substantially the entire fixed maturity securities portfolio is investment grade.

Further, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and write downs of the value of certain securities could further reduce our profitability. In addition, a decrease in value of our investment portfolio could put our subsidiaries at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. If we were not at that time able to supplement our capital by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our ability to continue growing could be adversely affected. See further discussion in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Income Taxes Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment. GAAP requires deferred tax assets and liabilities (DTAs and DTLs, respectively) to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. For example, we have a DTA because the tax bases of our loss and LAE reserves are smaller than their book bases. Similarly, we have a DTL because the book basis of our capitalized software exceeds its tax basis. Carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely, and net operating losses (NOLs), which may be carried forward 20 years for losses incurred after 1998. A summary of the significant DTAs and DTLs relating to the Companys temporary differences and carryforwards is included in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, our DTAs total $117.9 million and our DTLs total $69.5 million, for a net DTA of $48.4 million. At December 31, 2005, our DTAs were $121.5 million and our DTLs were $65.3 million, for a net DTA of $56.2 million. The net DTAs are classified as an asset, Deferred income taxes, in the consolidated balance sheets. We are required to reduce DTAs (but not DTLs) by a valuation allowance to the extent that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that any DTAs will not be realized. Recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur. The determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment. In making this judgment, management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the DTAs will be realized. The Companys net deferred tax assets include a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward for regular federal corporate tax purposes of approximately $9.3 million, representing an unrealized tax benefit of $3.3 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $33.6 million, $75.8 million and $105.3 million at the end of the three preceding years, respectively. As a result of taxable income since 2002, our NOL has been fully utilized through December 31, 2006 except for the amount relating to 21st Century Insurance Company of the Southwest that is subject to the IRS separate return limitation year provisions. The remaining NOL expires as follows: $1.4 million in 2017; $1.1 million in 2018; $1.5 million in 2019; $3.2 million in 2020; and $2.1 million in 2021. Our ability to fully utilize the NOL of 21st of the Southwest and our other DTAs depends primarily on future taxable income from operations and tax planning strategies. Because of the Companys profitable operating history and the availability of tax planning strategies, management believes it is reasonable to conclude that it is at least more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of all of our DTAs. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recognized at December 31, 2006. However, generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors, including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond our ability to control. Implementation of tax planning strategies to effect realization of our remaining NOL may require regulatory approvals, which although reasonably expected cannot be assured by management. Future operating losses could possibly jeopardize our ability to realize our other DTAs. Future unfavorable regulatory actions or operating losses would lead management to reach a different conclusion about the likelihood of realizing the DTAs and, if so, to recognize a valuation allowance at that time for some or all of the DTAs. 44 Table of Contents Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) include premium taxes, advertising after it takes place, and other variable costs incurred with writing business. While our customers typically renew their policies numerous times and on average stay with us for over five years, these costs are deferred and amortized over the six month policy period in which the related premiums are earned. Management assesses the recoverability of DPAC on a quarterly basis. The assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period. We do not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs. Based on current indications, management believes that these costs are fully recoverable at December 31, 2006. The loss and LAE ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on expected ultimate ratios provided by our actuaries. While management believes that is a reasonable assumption, actual results could differ materially from such estimates. Property and Equipment At December 31, 2006, net property and equipment included $131.0 million in software, net of related accumulated depreciation. This amount represented 84.5% of total net property and equipment, with the remaining balance consisting of furniture and equipment, leasehold and building improvements, building, and land. Management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. During 2006, the Company reassessed an asset group comprised of capitalized software dedicated to the administration of certain policies and concluded that such assets were impaired. An impairment of $0.9 million, classified as other expense, was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006. Pension Cost The Company has a qualified defined benefit pension plan, which covers essentially all employees who have completed at least one year of service. The pension benefits under the qualified plan are based on employees compensation during all years of service. The Companys funding policy for the qualified plan is to make annual contributions as required by applicable regulations; employees may not make contributions to this plan. For certain key employees designated by the Board of Directors, the Company sponsors a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan. The supplemental plan benefits are based on years of service and compensation during the three highest of the last ten years of employment prior to retirement and are reduced by the benefit payable from the qualified pension plan and 50% of the social security benefit. Because the internal revenue code does not allow current deductions for advance funding of a non qualified plan, the Companys funding policy with respect to this plan is to make contributions as benefits become payable to participants. In September 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) ("FAS 158"), which the Company was required to adopt effective December 31, 2006. FAS 158 requires the Company to (1) recognize the funded status of the defined benefit plans in its statement of financial position, (2) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, (3) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position and (4) disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligations. Adoption of FAS 158 had the effect of reducing stockholders equity by $14.2 million at December 31, 2006, as explained further in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adoption of FAS 158 had no effect on the Companys compliance with its financial covenants. The Company makes a number of assumptions relating to its pension plans to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate, the expected long term return on plan assets (ROA) and the rate of future compensation increase. The effects of changes in these assumptions affect both the Companys earnings and its financial position. The earnings effects generally are accounted for initially as deferred actuarial gains or losses, which in turn prospectively affect the determination of the amortization component of net periodic pension cost. Changes in the discount rate and future compensation assumptions also affect the actuarial measurement of the plans projected benefit obligations, which in turn impacts the plans funded status and results in an increase or decrease in shareholders equity absent any offsetting changes in the fair value of plan assets. The effects of such changes in assumptions could be material to the Companys earnings and financial condition. 45 Table of Contents The effects of such changes in assumptions are complex but can be summarized as shown in the following table: Increase in Discount Rate Increase in Future Compensation Rate Increase in Assumed Return on Assets Effect on projected benefit obligation and funded status Decrease Increase None Effect on service cost Decrease in pension cost Increase in pension cost None Effect on interest cost Increase in pension cost Increase in pension cost None Effect on expected return on assets None None Decrease in pension cost Effect on amortization cost Decrease in pension cost Increase in pension cost Decrease in pension cost The discussion below illustrates the sensitivity of the pre tax pension measurements to hypothetical changes in assumptions, but is not intended to represent a prediction of the future performance of our defined benefit plans. Discount Rate Because by definition it is intended to be market sensitive, the discount rate assumption typically varies from year to year and is determined by developing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matched to our projected benefit costs. The weighted average discount rate assumption for determining net periodic pension cost is 5.9% for 2007, compared with 5.7% in 2006, 6.0% in 2005 and 6.1% in 2004. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate assumption for 2008 would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense for 2008 by approximately $0.7 million. Return on Assets The expected long term rate of return on assets is a weighted average expectation for the return on plan assets. The Company considers historical performance and current benchmarks to arrive at expected long term rates of return in each asset category. The Company utilizes consulting pension actuaries to perform stochastic modeling services to assist the Company in determining the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets, based on an assumption that 75% of the plan asset portfolio will be invested in equity securities, with the remainder invested in debt securities. Historical returns are not adjusted for purposes of performing the stochastic modeling. The long term ROA assumption for the Companys pension plans in 2007 is 8.5%, unchanged from 2006, 2005 and 2004. By way of comparison, the actual returns on plan assets were 13.6% in 2006, 7.3% in 2005 and 12.0% in 2004, representing a three year weighted average of 11.0%. Net periodic benefit cost was $9.2 million, $8.9 million, and $9.0 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and included expected return on plan assets of $8.4 million, $7.3 million, and $6.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets caused actuarial gains (losses) of approximately $5.4 million, ($1.0) million, and $2.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the expected ROA assumption would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense in 2008 by approximately $0.3 million. For every 2.5% that the actual pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2007, the Companys pension expense for 2008 would change by approximately $0.5 million. Future Compensation To develop the assumed rate of future compensation, the Company considers the historical compensation of the plan participants and future wage expectations taking into consideration inflation indicators such as the consumer price index. An increase or decrease of 1.0% in the expected rate of future compensation assumption would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense in 2008 by approximately $0.9 million. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Stock based Compensation Cost For periods prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share based payment transactions with employees in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (FAS) 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (FAS 123). Under the provisions of FAS 123, we had elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We did not recognize in income any compensation expense for the fair value of stock options awarded to employees as all employee stock options were granted at the closing market price on the grant date. However, stock based employee compensation cost relating to restricted stock was recognized in the statements of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2006. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R. Unlike FAS 123, which was elective, FAS 123R requires that companies use a fair value method to value share based payments and recognize the related compensation expense in net earnings. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of the employee stock options. 46 Table of Contents The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective application method, and accordingly, financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this Form 10 K have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation under FAS 123R. The modified prospective application method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to stock based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006 and all previously granted, but unvested awards at January 1, 2006. The adoption of FAS 123R in 2006 resulted in additional stock based compensation cost of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, which previously would have been only presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure. FAS 123R also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation, as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. No cumulative adjustment was necessary for prior year forfeitures as these were estimated in the Companys prior year pro forma financial statements. In addition, FAS 123R requires us to reflect the cash savings resulting from excess tax benefits (i.e., the benefit of the tax deduction for a share based payment that exceeds the recognized compensation cost for that award) in its consolidated financial statements as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior periods. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at December 31, 2006, was $8.7 million and the weighted average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years. For grants made on or after January 1, 2006, the Company applied the non substantive vesting period approach, which requires recognition of compensation expense from the grant date to the earlier of the vesting date or the date retirement eligibility is achieved for awards with retirement eligibility options. The use of the non substantive vesting approach does not affect the overall amount of compensation expense recognized, but does accelerate the recognition of expense. This resulted in $0.7 million in accelerated vesting of awards incurred during the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, we recognized $1.4 million in stock based compensation expense in connection with the accelerated vesting of awards as part of an executive retention agreement. For the remaining portion of awards that were unvested and granted prior to January 1, 2006, we will continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach, and accordingly recognize the expense from the grant date to the earlier of the actual date of retirement or the vesting date. Calculating the fair value of stock option awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the stock price volatility. Volatility is a measure of stock price fluctuation in a given period. The objective of estimating volatility is to ascertain the assumption about expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining a price for an option. The Company is excluded from relying exclusively on the historical volatility of its publicly traded common stock as the Companys stock has been impacted by significant one time events. As such, the Company develops its volatility for each stock option grant by combining the volatility of its competitors in the Property & Casualty insurance industry. In addition to the volatility calculation, other assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock option awards involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, the computed fair value and resulting stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Furthermore, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. The 2006 grants had a weighed fair value of $4.99 that was derived using the Black Scholes model. The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the weighed fair value to hypothetical changes in assumptions, but is not intended to represent a prediction of the future fair values. Actual weighted average assumption Weighted average assumption adjusted upward to: Weighted average fair value after upward adjustment Weighted average assumption adjusted downward to: Weighted average fair value after downward adjustment Weighted volatility assumption 29.40 % 31.40 % $ 5.24 27.40 % $ 4.75 Weighted dividend rate assumption 1.94 2.94 4.39 0.94 5.66 See additional discussion in Notes 2 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 158, which requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer benefit plans to (1) recognize the funded status of the defined benefit plans in its statement of financial position, (2) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, (3) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position and (4) disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs on credits, and transition asset or obligations. At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FAS 158, which had the effect of reducing stockholders equity by approximately $14.2 million. The adoption of FAS 158 did not have any effect on the Companys compliance with its financial covenants. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, that the implementation of FAS 157 will have on our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective for the Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on the financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FAS No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This interpretation will be effective January 1, 2007. We expect the adoption of FIN 48 will result in the recognition of a reduction of retained earnings of approximately $2.5 million effective January 1, 2007. Statement of Position 05 1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts (SOP 05 1), becomes effective January 1, 2007. SOP 05 1 provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. The SOP defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverage that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. We are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. In addition to market risk, we are exposed to other risks, including the credit risk related to the issuers of the financial instruments in which we invest, the underlying insurance risk related to our core business and the exposure of the personal automobile lines insurance business, as a regulated industry, to legal, legislative, judicial, political and regulatory action. Financial instruments are not used for trading purposes. The Company also obtained long term fixed rate financing as a means of increasing the statutory surplus of the Companys largest insurance subsidiary in 2002 and 2003. The following disclosure reflects estimated changes in value that may result from selected hypothetical changes in market rates and prices. Actual results may differ. Fixed maturity financial instruments Our cash flows from operations and short term cash position generally have been more than sufficient to meet our projected obligations for claim payments, which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business, tend to have an average duration of less than one year. As a result, it has been unnecessary for us to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies. For all of our fixed maturity securities, which comprises the majority of the Companys investment portfolio, we seek to provide for liquidity and diversification while maximizing income without sacrificing investment quality. The value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk where the value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio decreases as market interest rates increase, and conversely, when market interest rates decrease, the value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio increases. Duration is a common measure of the sensitivity of a fixed maturity securitys value to changes in interest rates. The higher the duration, the more sensitive a fixed maturity security is to market interest rate fluctuations. Effective duration also measures this sensitivity, but it takes into account call terms, as well as changes in remaining term, coupon rate, cash flow, and other items. Since fixed maturity securities with longer remaining terms to maturity tend to realize higher yields, the Companys investment philosophy typically resulted in a portfolio with an effective duration of over 6 years. Due to the changing interest rate environment in 2004, management, in consultation with the Investment Committee, targeted a lower duration for the Companys fixed maturity security portfolio to reduce the negative impact of potential increases in interest rates. As a result, the effective duration of the total fixed maturity portfolio declined from approximately 4.7 years at December 31, 2005 to 4.0 years at December 31, 2006. The graphical depiction of the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same credit quality with different maturities is usually referred to as a yield curve. Because the yield on U.S. Treasury securities is the base rate (or risk free rate) from which non government bond yields are normally benchmarked, the most commonly constructed yield curve is derived from the observation of prices and yields in the Treasury market. An upward sloping curve, where yield rises steadily as maturity increases, is referred to as a normal yield curve. The following table shows the carrying values of our fixed maturity securities, which are reported at fair value, and our debt, which is reported at amortized cost. The table also presents estimated fair values at adjusted market rates assuming a parallel 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, given the effective duration noted above, for the fixed maturity investment portfolio and a parallel 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates for the debt determined from a present value calculation. The following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market interest rate risk: AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS Carrying Value Estimated Carrying Value at Adjusted Market Rates/Prices Indicated Above Change in Value as a Percentage of Carrying Value December 31, 2006 Fixed maturity securities available for sale, at fair value $ 1,435.0 $ 1,379.3 (3.9 %) Debt, at amortized cost 115.9 121.9 5.3 The discussion above provides only a limited, point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of our fixed rate financial instruments. The actual impact of interest rate changes on our fixed maturity securities in particular may differ significantly from those shown, as the analysis assumes a parallel shift in market interest rates. The analysis also does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates. The difference between long term Treasury yields and short term Treasury yields are usually referred as the slope of the yield curve. If the spread between the long end of the curve, where maturities are high, and the short end of the curve, where maturities are low, narrows, the yield curve is said to be flattening. Conversely, if the spread between the long end of the curve and the short end of the curve widens, the yield curve is said to be steepening. If the yields on the long end of the curve fall below those of the short end of the curve, the yield curve is said to be inverted. 49 Table of Contents The analysis above assumes a parallel shift in interest rates. However, the curve may also steepen, flatten or become inverted. This type of behavior may affect certain sections of the curve in disproportionate amounts. For example, if short term Treasury yields rise and the yield curve flattens, fixed maturity instruments with short duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with longer duration. Conversely, if long term Treasury yields rise and the yield curve steepens, fixed maturity instruments with long duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with shorter duration. The following summarizes the effective duration distribution of our fixed maturity securities portfolio. Duration Ranges December 31, 2006 Below 1 1 to 3 3 to 5 5 to 7 7 to 10 10 to 20 Fair value percentage of fixed maturity securities portfolio 1.7% 22.0% 61.8% 13.3% 1.2% 0.0% Equity investments In an effort to enhance yield and provide some non correlated diversification to our fixed income portfolio, the Company has invested in equity securities. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company sold its publicly traded equity security portfolio and subsequently invested in a private equity portfolio. The Company committed $35 million to an AIGGIC managed fund of private equity investments and funded $14.4 million of the $35 million commitment in 2006. The value of these private equity investments are calculated on a quarterly basis, as AIGGIC consolidates the performance of each fund partner and each particular investment. The primary risk in this portfolio is event driven risk. This is managed via diversification across fund managers and styles, as well as by AIGGICs long history of experience in the asset class. The Company also has a small portion, $0.3 million, of its community related investment portfolio invested in a single private equity transaction. 50 Table of Contents
