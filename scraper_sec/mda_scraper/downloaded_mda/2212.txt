Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California., we are a leader in driving the design, development and implementation of semiconductors for the secure storage, distribution and presentation of high definition content. We create and promote industry standards for digital content delivery such as DVI, HDMI and SATA, leveraging partnerships with global leaders in the consumer electronics and personal computing markets to meet the growing digital content needs of consumers worldwide. We have shipped more than 97 million HDMI/HDCP and DVI/HDCP semiconductor solutions. We are the leading provider of semiconductor intellectual property solutions for high definition multimedia and data storage applications. We market products to the CE, PC/display, and storage markets. Our CE semiconductor products are used in a growing array of devices, including DTV, DVD, STBs, A/V Receivers, game consoles, camcorders, and digital still cameras. In the PC market, we continue to be a leader in the DVI market. Our DVI products are marketed under our VastLane product family having shipped over 84 million components to date. In the storage market, we have assumed a leadership role in SATA, a standard that is replacing PATA in desktop storage and making inroads in the enterprise arena due to its improved price/performance ratio. In addition, we offer one of the most robust and comprehensively tested technology platforms in the consumer electronics industry through our Simplay Labs Simplay HDtm Testing Program. Simplay Labs, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Silicon Image, is a leading provider of testing technologies, tools and services for high definition consumer electronics devices such as HDTVs, set top boxes, A/V receivers and DVD players, helping manufacturers to achieve compatibility and deliver the highest quality HDTV experience to consumers. During 2006, we commenced the implementation of a global strategy that the Company believes will, in the long run, result in certain operational benefits as well as provide the Company with a lower annual effective tax rate that is lower than if we did not pursue this strategy. Our strategy involves an increased investment in technology and headcount outside the United States in order to better align asset ownership and business functions with our expectations related to the sources, timing and amounts of future revenues and profits. As a result of undertaking these efforts, the Company anticipates an annual effective tax rate in 2007 to be in the 55% to 60% range which is materially higher than our combined federal, state and foreign statutory tax rate of approximately 41%. Assuming implementation of our global strategy, we expect our annual effective tax rate for 2008 to decline to a range of 39% to 43%. Longer term, we expect that our income tax rate will decline from that level. See Risk Factors There are risks to our global strategy. On January 3, 2007, we completed our acquisition of sci worx, an intellectual property and design service provider specializing in multimedia, communications, and networking applications. We purchased sci worx GmbH, from Infineon. We purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of sci worx and paid sci worxs intercompany debt to another Infineon subsidiary. The purchase price for the acquisition was $13.6 million in cash for sci worx capital stock and its intercompany debt (net of its cash balances at closing). The newly acquired company is now referred to as Silicon Image Germany and has approximately 172 employees, based in Hanover, Germany. As a result of the acquisition, we expect our costs to increase primarily due to growth in acquired headcount and related expenses. On February 5, 2007, we entered into a Video Processor Design License Agreement with Sunplus. Under the terms of the license agreement, Silicon Image will receive a license to use and further develop advanced video processor technology. The license agreement provides for the payment of an aggregate of $40.0 million to Sunplus by Silicon Image, $35.0 million of which is payable in consideration for the licensed technology and related deliverables and $5.0 million of which is payable in consideration for Sunplus support and maintenance obligations. We paid Sunplus $10.0 million of the consideration for the licensed technology and related deliverables in February 2007, and are required to pay the remaining $25.0 million upon delivery and completion of certain milestones. The $5.0 million to be paid for support and maintenance by Sunplus is payable over a two year period starting upon delivery of the final Sunplus deliverables. The license agreement also provides for the grant to Sunplus 43 Table of Contents of a license to certain of our intellectual property, for which Sunplus has agreed to pay us $5.0 million upon delivery and acceptance of such intellectual property. We anticipate that the technology licensed from Sunplus, along with the engineering talent and intellectual property recently acquired in the sci worx transaction, will enhance and accelerate our ability to develop and offer a broader array of consumer product offerings, ranging from discrete HDMI chips to new integrated front end DTV input processors and fully integrated SoC DTV products. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain: Revenue recognition For products sold directly to end users, or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return, we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured. Reserves for sales returns are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment. The amount of sales returns and allowances has not been, and is not expected to be, material. The majority of our products are sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns. We recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer based on point of sales reports received from our distributors. Due to the timing of receipt of these reports, we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month. Revenue is not recognized upon shipment since, due to various forms of price concessions; the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time. Price concessions are recorded when incurred, which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user. Additionally, these distributors have contractual rights to return products, up to a specified amount for a given period of time. Revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user, at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed. Our revenue is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion. Distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product, price, quantity, and end customer shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize, we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities. If distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities, or if our judgment is in error, it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income. We have controls in place to minimize the likelihood of this occurrence, but there is no absolute assurance that this will not occur. Pursuant to our distributor agreements, older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions. Certain of our distributor agreements for new products also contain provisions that do not allow for product returns or price concessions. For these products, revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. At the time of shipment to distributors, we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment, relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor, and record the gross margin in Deferred margin on sale to distributors, a component of current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor. However, the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sale to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions. We sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price. However, distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer, product, quantity, geography, competitive pricing, and other factors. The majority of our 44 Table of Contents distributors resale are priced at a discount from list price. Often, under these circumstances, we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed. Thus, a substantial portion of the Deferred margin on the sale to distributor and related allowances on sales to distributors balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future. The wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the Deferred margin on the sale to distributor and related allowances on sales to distributors that will be remitted back to the distributors. We do reduce deferred income by anticipated or determinable future price concessions. License revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery or performance has occurred, and collection is reasonably assured. Generally, we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items. However, we may defer recognition of revenue until either cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery or, in the event that the arrangement includes undelivered elements for which the fair value cannot be determined, until the earlier of such time that the fair value can be determined or the elements are delivered. The fair value of undelivered elements is generally based upon the price charged when the elements are sold separately. A number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables, in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within 90 days of acceptance. Certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates. Such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement. The amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate, extended by the number of units shipped by the customer. To determine the number of units shipped, we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available, and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held, manufactured and other information. These estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment. As a result of our use of estimates, period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped. To date, such true up adjustments have not been significant. In cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue, we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received. Revenues from such licenses are recognized proportionately as we perform services. On certain arrangements, revenues derived from development services are recognized using the percentage of completion method. For all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method, we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred. Our license revenue recognition depends upon many factors including development project status, completion of milestones, allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances. Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments. Cash equivalents consist of short term, highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Short term investments consist of taxable commercial paper, United States government agency obligations, corporate/municipal notes and bonds with high credit quality, money market preferred stock and auction rate preferred stock and have maturities greater than three months from the date of purchase. The fair market value, based on quoted market prices, of cash equivalents and short term investments. Cost of securities sold is based on a specific identification method. In determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these investments is other than temporary, the Company evaluates the market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples and other key measures. When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible. During our review, we consider our historical experience, the age of the receivable balance, the credit worthiness of the customer, and the reason for the delinquency. Delinquent account balances are 45 Table of Contents written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote. Write offs to date have not been material. At December 31, 2006, we had $40.2 million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of $235,000. While we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance, we may record unanticipated write offs in the future. Inventories We record inventories at the lower of actual cost, determined on a first in first out (FIFO) basis, or market. Actual cost approximates standard cost, adjusted for variances between standard and actual. Standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs, manufacturing yields, costs to assemble, test and package our products, and allocable indirect costs. We record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances. These variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of operations in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a FIFO basis. Standard costs are evaluated at least annually. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory, and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to managements forecast of customer demand. Customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process. We must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products. Generally, inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue. Once a provision is established, it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of, even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product. Goodwill and intangible assets We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 (SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible. This standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on a periodic basis. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results, projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels. In estimating the fair value of the business, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business, there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows. We also consider market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis. Based on our annual impairment test performed for 2006, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings. Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, tax benefits, and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. Deferred Tax Assets We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. In general, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value, if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Prior to 2006, we had provided a valuation allowance against 100% of our net deferred tax assets. In 2006, we determined that our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006 are more likely than not to be realized. Therefore, in 2006, we released the 46 Table of Contents remaining valuation allowance of approximately $52.3 million that had reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005. Approximately $14.3 million of the valuation allowance release relates to prior years windfall tax benefits on employee stock transactions that were included in the deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2005. This portion of the valuation allowance release was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid in capital instead of a reduction to the tax provision. At December 31, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets, related primarily to stock based compensation, accruals and reserves that are not currently deductible, and tax credit carry forwards of $23.4 million. At December 31, 2005 our gross deferred tax assets of $52.3 million consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and stock based compensation not currently deductible for tax purposes. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Accrued Liabilities Certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates. For instance, we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us, for which we have not received an invoice. Our estimates are based on historical experience, input from sources outside the company, and other relevant facts and circumstances. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates. Certain of our licensing agreements require that we indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent, trademark or copyright by third parties related to intellectual property content of our products. Certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement (and, in some instances the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited). To date, we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim. Stock Based Compensation Expense Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards. We elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, as adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, our ESPP is considered a compensatory plan and we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the ESPP. We recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis for all share based payment awards over the respective requisite service period of the awards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 requires that management determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. We expect to adopt the provisions of FIN No. 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN No. 48 on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In September, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This statement also requires expanded disclosures on the inputs used 47 Table of Contents to measure fair value, and for recurring fair value measurements using unobservable inputs, which affects the earnings for the period. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Additionally, prospective application of this statement is required as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this Statement but does not expect that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 provides that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. The guidance in SAB 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We have adopted SAB 108, and have considered its provisions in the preparation of our current financial statements and related disclosures and, as of December 31, 2006, it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159) which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. Reclassifications Patent assertion costs (reimbursement), net, of ($5.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2006 has been disclosed as a stand alone caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The patent assertion costs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $326,000 and $519,000 respectively, have been reclassified from selling, general and administrative expense to a stand alone caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, to be consistent with the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on the Companys previously disclosed net loss, cash flows or stockholders equity. Restructuring recovery of $220,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been reclassified from a stand alone caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, to selling, general and administrative expense to be consistent with the current year presentation. Restructuring expense included within the selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled $25,000. The reclassifications had no effect on the Companys previously disclosed net loss, cash flows or stockholders equity.

The increase in the CE product revenue was due primarily to strong sales volumes of HDMI receivers and transmitters. The increase in PC product revenue was driven primarily by PC transmitters that incorporate our DVI technology and our intelligent panel controllers, which are key components in LCD displays, partially offset by modest erosion in the average selling prices of products. Revenue from our DVI products are expected to decline in the future as DVI technology is replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort. The decrease in storage product revenue was due to the trend of declining sales of our legacy storage systems products, which are being phased out of customer applications, partially offset by contributions from our new SATA and SteelVine products. We have experienced erosion of average selling prices for all of our product categories. We expect average selling prices to continue to decline in the first quarter of 2007. We license our technology in each of our areas of business, but usually limit the scope of the license to market areas that are complementary to our product sales and do not directly compete with our direct product offerings. The increase in licensing revenues in 2006 relative to 2005, was attributable primarily to recognition of royalty revenue of $11.8 million pursuant to the Genesis litigation settlement agreement, increased intellectual property licensing arrangements and the timing of revenue recognition for development projects. Total revenue for 2005 was $212.4 million and represented a sequential growth of 22.7% over 2004. The increase in the CE product revenue was primarily due to strong sales of HDMI receivers and transmitters. The growth in PC product revenue was driven primarily by our new PC transmitters that incorporate our DVI technology and our intelligent panel controllers, which are key components in LCD displays, partially offset by erosion in the average selling prices of PC products. The decrease in storage product revenue was due to the trend of declining sales of our legacy storage systems products and Fibre Channel SerDes, which are being phased out of customer applications, partially offset by contributions from our new SATA and SteelVine products. The decrease in licensing revenues in 2005 relative to 2004, was attributable primarily to the deferral of revenue for certain development projects. Products sold into the CE market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated 57%, 51% and 41.% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. If we include licensing revenues, these percentages would be 66%, 56%, and 49% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Demand for our CE products are driven primarily by the adoption rate of the HDMI standard within the CE market and we expect revenue from our CE products to continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues as CE manufacturers continue to introduce new products using our HDMI 1.3 products. Revenues from the PC market have been consistent, in dollar terms, in 2006 as compared to 2005 and 2004 and generated 17% of our revenue in 2006, 23% of our revenue in 2005, and 24% of our revenues in 2004. If we include licensing revenues, these percentages would be 20%, 24%, and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The slight increase in PC revenue for 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily a result of sales of our DVI products increasing in 2006 due to the peaking of the adoption of the standard. We expect revenues from DVI products to decline in the future as it is replaced by HDMI and DisplayPort standards. While 2006 revenues grew in absolute dollars, our 2006 PC product revenues were negatively affected by battery recalls by major computer manufacturers as well as the late launch of Windows Vista operating system. Licensing revenues included in our revenues from the PC market increased substantially in 2006 due to the recognition of royalty revenues related to the settlement agreement with Genesis. 49 Table of Contents Products sold into the storage market, as a percentage of our total revenues, generated 11%, 17%, and 23% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. If we include storage related licensing revenues, these percentages were 14%, 20%, and 27%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Demand for our storage semiconductor products is dependent upon the rate at which interface technology transitions from parallel to serial, market acceptance of our SteelVine architecture, and the extent to which SATA is integrated into chipsets and controllers offered by other companies, which would make our discrete devices unnecessary. In 2007, we anticipate our legacy storage semiconductor business and PATA revenues to continue decreasing as our SteelVine revenues are projected to increase. Our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology. Most of the intellectual property we license include a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building a chip in direct competition with those market segments we have chosen to pursue. Revenue from development for licensees, licensing and royalties accounted for 15.1%, 8.7% and 12.0% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to recognition of $11.8 million of royalty revenues related to the Settlement Agreement with Genesis Microchip in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the recognition of revenue for certain development projects that were previously deferred. See detailed discussion under Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones, allocation of values to delivered items, and customer acceptances. Although we attempt to make these factors predictable, many of these factors require significant judgments. Commitments, Contingencies and Concentrations Historically, a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue. For instance, our top five customers, including distributors, generated 57%, 54%, and 47% of our revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant, since many OEMs rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions. In 2006, 50% of our revenue was generated through distributors, compared to 52% in 2005 and 45% in 2004. Microtek comprised 16%, 11%, and 12% of our revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Innotech Corporation, comprised 16%, 9% and 5% of our revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. World Peace Inc., comprised 12%, 17% and 15% of our revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors, and to the extent licensing revenue increases, we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas. Sales (including licensing) to customers in Asia, including distributors, generated 72%, 74%, and 67% of our revenue in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reason for our geographical concentration in Asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays, graphic cards and motherboards, the majority of which are manufactured in Asia. The percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products. Accordingly, variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends, but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations. All revenue to date has been denominated in U.S. dollars. COST OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue(1) $ 121,247 45.9 % $ 83,105 21.1 % $ 68,614 Total gross margin $ 173,711 34.4 % $ 129,294 23.7 % $ 104,545 Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue 58.9 % 60.9 % 60.4 % (1) Includes stock based compensation expense (benefit) $ 2,427 $ (1,383 ) $ 2,777 50 Table of Contents Cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as related overhead costs. Gross margin (revenue minus cost of revenue), as a percentage of revenue was 58.9%, 60.9% and 60.4% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in gross margin from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense of $2.4 million under FAS 123R Share Based Payment as compared to the stock compensation benefit of $1.4 million recorded in 2005 under APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, erosion in the average selling prices of our products as a result of increased competition, and to a lesser extent by higher overhead expenses as a result of increase in headcount and related compensation. In 2007, we expect continued competitive pressures to continue to reduce our average selling prices. However, we plan to mitigate this average selling price erosion through cost reductions and new product launches with expected higher margins. Also as a result of the Sci worx acquisition, we expect our gross margins to be adversely affected in the first quarter of 2007 by Silicon Image Germanys existing design services activities and other customer programs which are currently charged against cost of revenue. We expect that the effect of the sci worx acquisition on our gross margins will decline over time as Silicon Image Germany shifts its focus to new product development, which will be charged to research and development expenses. The increase in gross margin from 2004 to 2005 was due to recognition of stock based compensation benefit of $1.4 million in 2005 as compared to stock based compensation expense of $2.8 million in 2004. The net change in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by $2.3 million less in licensing revenue, which have a disproportionate impact on gross profit compared to product sales, erosion in the average selling prices of our products, and higher overhead expenses. OPERATING EXPENSES Research and Development 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Research and development(1) $ 63,598 41.8 % $ 44,860 (27.0 )% $ 61,459 Percentage of total revenue 21.6 % 21.1 % 35.5 % (1) Includes stock based compensation expense (benefit) 11,108 (3,851 ) 16,647 Research and development (R&D). R&D expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees, fees for independent contractors, the cost of software tools used for designing and testing our products and costs associated with prototype materials. R&D expense, including stock based compensation expense, was $63.6 million, or 21.6% of revenue for 2006, compared to $44.9 million, or 21.1% of revenue, for 2005, and $61.5 million, or 35.5% of revenue, for 2004. The increase in R&D expenses in 2006 was primarily due to an increased headcount, performance bonus incentives and implementation of FAS 123R Share Based Payment resulting in a recognition of stock based compensation expense of $11.1 million as compared to the net stock compensation benefit of $3.9 million recorded in 2005 under APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In addition, the increase also reflected increased use of consultants and the number of R&D projects and lower credit to expense from engineering projects funded by outside parties. While continuing to honor and support existing contract obligations assumed in connection with our acquisition of Silicon Image Germany, over time, we expect our R&D expense to increase as Silicon Image Germany shifts its focus to new product development. 51 Table of Contents The decrease in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to the recognition of stock compensation benefit of $3.9 million in 2005 as compared to stock based compensation expense of $16.6 million in 2004 as well as the benefit from a credit to expense of approximately $1.8 million related to three engineering projects that are being funded by outside parties, irrespective of the results of the projects. These items were partially offset by an increase in the number of R&D projects as well higher salaries and wages resulting from an increased number of engineers on staff. Additional costs are also attributable to the increasing level of complexity in our new products. Selling, General and Administrative 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative(2) $ 67,597 115.0 % $ 31,438 (25.5 )% $ 42,183 Percentage of total revenue 22.9 % 14.8 % 24.4 % (2) Includes stock based compensation expense (benefit) 13,696 (3,297 ) 13,359 Selling, general and administrative(SG&A). SG&A expense consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits, sales commissions, and marketing and promotional expenses. Including non cash stock based compensation expense, SG&A expense was $67.6 million or 22.9% of revenue, $31.4 million, or 14.8% of revenue for 2005, and $42.2 million, or 24.4% of revenue for 2004. The increase in SG&A expense in 2006 was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense of $13.7 million under FAS 123R Share Based Payment as compared to the stock compensation benefit of $3.3 million recorded in 2005 under APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and to a lesser extent by an increase in headcount and performance incentives in the form of bonuses to employees. The decrease in SG&A expense for 2005 was due to the $16.7 million stock compensation benefit and a significant decrease in legal costs relating to corporate governance issues. These items were partially offset by higher salaries and wages, higher fees for consulting and professional services, and higher commissions on higher sales. Amortization of Intangible assets 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Amortization of intangible assets $ 508 (53.7 )% $ 1,098 (18.4 )% $ 1,345 Percentage of total revenue 0.2 % 0.5 % 0.8 % Amortization of intangible assets. During 2006, we recorded $508,000 of amortization of intangible assets, as compared to $1.1 million and $1.3 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amortization expense recorded relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Transwarp Networks. Patent Assertion Costs (Reimbursement), Net 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Patent assertion costs (reimbursement), net $ (5,244 ) (1708.6 )% $ 326 (37.2 )% $ 519 Percentage of total revenue (1.8 )% 0.2 % 0.3 % Patent assertion costs (reimbursement), net. The reimbursement of patent assertion costs in the amount of $5.4 million recorded in 2006 as a contra expense, relates to the reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred in connection with the Genesis litigation. Please refer to Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings section for a detailed discussion of the Genesis litigation and settlement. Included in this caption are patent assertion costs. The reimbursement of $5.4 million has been offset by $143,000 in patent assertion costs incurred in 2006. The patent assertion costs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $326,000 and $519,000 respectively, have been reclassified from selling, general and administrative expense to a standalone caption in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to be consistent with the current year presentation. Interest Income and other, Net 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Interest income and other, net $ 9,205 169.9 % $ 3,410 374.9 % $ 718 Percentage of total revenue 3.1 % 1.6 % 0.4 % Interest income. Interest income was $9.4 million, $3.6 million, and $945,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increases in interest income for each year was attributable primarily to the increased cash and investment balances and higher interest rates. 52 Table of Contents Other expenses, net. Net other expenses were $233,000, $195,000, and $227,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In 2005, we recorded a net gain of $1.3 million from the mark to market and subsequent sale of our holdings in Leadis Technology, Inc (Leadis). In 2004, we recorded a net gain of $926,000 related to this investment. These holdings related to equity we acquired in a transaction with Leadis. As of December 31, 2005 our investment in Leadis was fully liquidated. Our typical practice is not to hold equity shares for investment purposes. Provision for Income Taxes 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 13,992 107.9 % $ 6,730 568.3 % $ 1,007 Percentage of total revenue 4.7 % 3.2 % 0.6 % Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded income tax expense of $14.0 million, compared to $6.7 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004. Our effective income tax rate was 25% in 2006. In 2006, the difference between the provision for income taxes and the income tax determined by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% was due primarily to the following three items: (1) $18.5 million of federal loss carryforwards utilized, inclusive of $14.3 million related to excess stock option tax benefits for which the reduction of the related valuation allowance was recorded to additional paid in capital, (2) $24.8 million associated with the impact of the release of our remaining valuation allowance inclusive of certain current year changes in the deferred tax asset to which the valuation allowance relates, and (3) $22.8 million of tax charges related to unbenefited foreign losses in connection with the ongoing implementation of a new global strategy. The tax charges related to unbenefited foreign losses represent expenses for sharing in the costs of our ongoing research and development efforts as well as licensing commercial rights to exploit pre existing intangibles to better align with customers outside the Americas. The new global strategy is designed to better align asset ownership and business functions with our expectations related to the sources, timing and amounts of future revenues and profits. In future years, we expect to achieve both operational benefits and a lower annual effective tax rate as a result of the new global strategy. See Overview and Risk Factors There are risks to our global strategy. The fiscal year 2005 tax expense of $6.7 million was due primarily to a $5.4 million non cash charge associated with stock option exercises, while the remaining $1.3 million was primarily for taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and U.S. alternative minimum tax. The income tax provision of $1.0 million recorded in 2004 was primarily for foreign withholding taxes payable in connection with our licensing contracts, other foreign taxes where we recently commenced operations, and a provision for U.S. alternative minimum tax. 53 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 81,921 $ 4,044 $ 77,877 $ 54,597 $ 23,280 Short term investments 168,724 95,039 73,685 3,445 70,240 Total cash, cash equivalents and short term investment $ 250,645 $ 99,083 $ 151,562 $ 58,042 $ 93,520 Percentage of total assets 65.9% 65.0% 60.4% Total current assets $ 336,551 $ 134,739 $ 201,812 $ 71,876 $ 129,936 Total current liabilities (74,471 ) (24,863 ) (49,608 ) (16,779 ) (32,829 ) Working capital $ 262,080 $ 109,876 $ 152,204 $ 55,097 $ 97,107 Cash provided by operating activities $ 46,003 $ (9,617 ) $ 55,620 $ 19,174 $ 36,446 Cash used in investing activities (100,647 ) (88,458 ) (12,189 ) 40,951 (53,140 ) Cash provided by financing activities 58,669 47,503 11,166 (10,874 ) 22,040 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents 19 19 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,044 $ (50,553 ) $ 54,597 $ 49,251 $ 5,346 Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and exercise of stock options. At December 31, 2006, we had $262.1 million of working capital and $250.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments increased by $99.1 million in 2006, compared to an increase of $58.0 million in 2005. We anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balances together with income derived from sales of our products and licensing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future. Operating Activities Operating activities provided $46.0 million of cash during 2006 primarily due to non cash stock based compensation of $27.2 million. Net accounts receivable increased to $39.9 million or 32.5% in 2006 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of sales. Inventories increased to $28.3 million at December 31, 2006 from $17.1 million at December 31, 2005. The increase is attributable primarily to increased sales, to a buildup of inventories of certain new products to in advance of sales, and to production levels of certain products that exceeded sales levels in late 2006. Our inventory turns decreased to 4.7 at December 31, 2006 from 6.0 at December 31, 2005. Inventory turns are computed on an annualized basis, using the most recent quarter results, and are a measure of the number of times inventory is replenished during the year. We plan to reduce inventory levels in early 2007 by shipping the material we have and reducing our purchases accordingly. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred intellectual property license revenue that is being recognized as completed over the contract, decreased $3.0 million or 36.4% in 2006, which is primarily related to the timing and recognition of revenue for which contracts exist. Deferred margin on sales to distributors increased to $17.7 million or 28.6% in 2006, as a result of overall increased shipments to distributors. Other current liabilities including accounts payable and accrued liabilities, increased to $51.5 million or 88.5% attributable primarily with the volume of our business, the timing of vendor payments, the accrual for income taxes of $12.7 million and the accrual for inventory related items and other items of $6.1 million. Operating activities provided $55.6 million of cash during 2005. Increases in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred license revenue, and deferred margin on sales to distributors and decreases in prepaid assets and other current assets used $2.4 million in cash. 54 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $94.0 million, $8.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment of $13.5 million, $6.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Our investments are in U.S. government notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and auction rate securities, and generated $9.4 million in interest income in 2006. We are not a capital intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment in 2006, 2005 and 2004 related mainly to testing equipment, leasehold improvements and information technology infrastructure. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options exercises and ESPP purchases of $35.0 million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $23.9 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005 and 2004 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options exercises and ESPP purchases of $11.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. Cash requirements and commitments In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and any strategic acquisitions. Specifically, we expect our cash requirements in 2007 to include the following: Acquisition In January 2007, we spent approximately $13.6 million for the acquisition of sci worx. In addition, we also expect to pay $40.0 million under a licensing arrangement with Sunplus. Please refer to Note 11 Subsequent Events to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion. Commitments We have approximately $18.1 million in commitments for 2007 as disclosed in the contractual obligations table below. On February 8, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we intend, from time to time, as business conditions warrant, to purchase up to $100 million of common stock, on the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions. Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. As of March 1, 2007, no shares had yet been repurchased under this stock repurchase program. Debt and Lease Obligations In November 2004, we leased certain capital equipment under a lease arrangement accounted for as a capital lease. The remaining principal balance was repaid during 2006 and there was no outstanding principal balance outstanding under this lease arrangement as of December 31, 2006. The principal balance outstanding under this arrangement as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $230,000. In December 2002, we entered into a non cancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility, including an additional 30,000 square feet of space in an adjacent building, that commenced in August 2003 and expires in July 2010. In June 2004, the lease terms were amended and we leased approximately 28,000 square feet of additional space (for a total leased area of approximately 109,803 square feet). The revised agreement provides for a rent free period for the additional space and thereafter initial base monthly rental payments of $107,607 and provides for annual increases of 3% thereafter. As a result of the lease modification we recorded an adjustment of $220,000 to the restructuring accrual with an offsetting reduction of our operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2005. In May 2006, we entered into an amendment to the operating lease agreement. The amendment expanded the leased premises to include approximately 34,000 square feet of space in an adjacent building. The lease expiration was extended to July 2011 and the monthly rental payments are $146,237 with annual increases of 3% thereafter. 55 Table of Contents In June 2001, in connection with our acquisition of CMD, we acquired the lease of an operating facility in Irvine, California with average monthly rental payments of approximately $100,000 through November 2005. We subleased parts of this facility to three separate third parties. These sublease agreements were co terminous leases and expired in November 2005. These subleases collectively generated monthly sublease income of approximately $40,000 to offset our payments. Effective December 2005, the original lease was terminated and we entered into a new non cancelable operating lease agreement through November 2008. Under the terms of the new agreement, base monthly rental lease payments of $42,000 are required and increases annually 3% thereafter. We also lease office space in China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and United Kingdom. Rent expense totaled $2.6 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases have not been reduced by expected sublease rental income or by the amount of our restructuring accrual that relates to leased facilities. Future minimum payments for our software license commitments, operating leases, inventory and other purchase commitments and minimum royalty obligations at December 31, 2006 are as follows (in thousands): Payments Due In Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Contractual Obligations: Software license commitments $ 8,248 $ 3,971 $ 4,277 $ $ Operating lease obligations 10,529 2,851 4,643 3,035 Inventory purchase commitments 11,132 11,132 Minimum royalty obligation 100 100 Total $ 30,009 $ 18,054 $ 8,920 $ 3,035 $ Based on our estimated cash flows, we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We expect to continue to invest in property and equipment in the ordinary course of business. Our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors, including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins, the extent to which we generate cash through stock option exercises and proceeds from sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, the timing and extent of development, licensing and royalty revenue, investments in inventory, property, plant and equipment and accounts receivable, the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, our operating expenses, including legal and patent assertion costs, and general economic conditions. In addition, cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any. While, we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short term investment balances together with income derived from sales of our products and licensing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future, to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. These funds may not be available when we need them, or if available, we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, including government and corporate securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). All investments mature within one year from the date of purchase. We also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Due to the limited duration and 56 Table of Contents credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material. If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2006. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over a twelve month time horizon. The following represents the potential decrease to the value of our investments given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% $626,000 $1,253,000 $1,879,000 As of December 31, 2005, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities as reported in short term investments, including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately $151.6 million. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. The following represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% $388,000 $776,000 $1,163,000 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in U.S. dollars, thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Companys objective for holding derivatives is to minimize foreign currency exposure associated with foreign currency denominated transactions. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The effect of an immediate 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our future operating results or cash flows as any such increases in our currency exchange rate may result in increased wafer, packaging, assembly or testing costs as well as ongoing operating activities in our foreign operations. Additionally, many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell. Therefore, significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower U.S. dollar prices for our products, which would negatively affect our operating results. In December 2006, we entered into a forward exchange contracts in connection with the sci worx acquisition, with an aggregate notional amount of 11.3 million Euros, or approximately $14.9 million based upon the exchange rate at December 29, 2006. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate $1.5 million loss. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15(a) of this report.
