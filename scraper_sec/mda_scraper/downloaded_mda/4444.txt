Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: The following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Significant Developments In December 2006, we announced a workforce reduction plan that was implemented in response to our transitioning to a fabless semiconductor company, de emphasizing optical products, reducing dependency on commodity products and with the goal of improving our cost structure. As a result, we recorded total restructuring costs of $1.1 million related to employee severance compensation, including $0.1 million for vesting acceleration of stock options in lieu of a severance payment for a senior executive officer. Of the $1.1 million, $0.1 million was paid during December 2006. Our current business plans focus our product development and marketing programs toward a greater emphasis on our power management and interface products as we believe these products align greater development synergies and provide greater opportunities for growth and profitability in contrast to other areas such as our optical products. On September 20, 2006, we announced that we had received a notification from the Staff of the SEC that the investigation into matters related to our historical financial reports and revenue recognition practices had been terminated, and no enforcement had been recommended to the SEC with respect to the Company. 24 Table of Contents On September 8, 2006, we announced the appointment of Pierre Guilbault, Dan Casey, both members of the senior management team of Future, an affiliate of our largest stockholder, and Alan Krock, CFO of PMC Sierra, to our board of directors. Based upon our plans initially announced in the third quarter of 2005, in early October of 2006, we completed the shut down of our Milpitas wafer fabrication operations. The products that we formerly manufactured at the Milpitas fab are now manufactured by our wafer fab partner Silan and a wafer fab operated by Episil. We anticipate the financial impact of this transition will require multiple quarters to be realized in our operating results as we sell through higher cost inventory manufactured at our Milpitas fab. The conversion to a fully fabless manufacturing model along with the use of third party foundries should enable us to minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures while providing access to diverse manufacturing technologies without bearing the full risk of the obsolescence of such technologies. In conjunction with our previously announced internal investigation and restatement (as described in our annual reports on Forms 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2005), we were not in compliance with Nasdaqs Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because we did not timely file the annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended January 1, 2005 and quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the three months ended April 2, 2005. On June 21, 2005, a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, or the Panel, notified us that the Panel had denied our request for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Global Market. Our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market effective with the beginning of trading on June 23, 2005. On August 17, 2006, we announced the completion of our restatement of our financial statements for the fiscal year 2003 and related fiscal quarters of 2003 as well as completing the restatement of the first three quarters of 2004. In addition, we filed our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K and 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K along with our 2005 Quarterly Reports on Forms 10 Q. On September 21, 2006, we filed our Forms 10 Q Quarterly Reports with the SEC for the first and second quarters of 2006. Together with these reports, along with our Form 10 K/A and Form 10 K for 2005, our Form 10 K for 2004 and our Forms 10 Q for 2005, we became current with our periodic SEC reporting requirements. Business Overview We design, manufacture and market, high performance, analog ICs that are used primarily by OEMs, operating in the computing, consumer, communications and networking infrastructure markets. Some of the end product applications that contain our ICs are cellular phones, base stations, computers, DVD players, and digital cameras. Our products fall into three major product families: power management, interface and optical storage. We focus on several key areas to drive operating and financial performance, including product mix, new product introductions, cost reductions, manufacturing yield improvements and productivity. All of these key areas are interrelated and important in achieving improved gross margin. Product mix between our three product families and the sale of new products within each of our product families can significantly impact overall gross margin. Power management product margins have a wide range depending on the mix of sales within this product family. The very high volume commodity products sold into the Asian market, such as power regulators, typically have lower product margins. By contrast, our advanced power management product offerings, such as white LED (light emitting diode) drivers, and our Power Bloxtm family, are newer products, and contribute typically higher product margins. Many Interface products are commodity products as well, but overall the product family typically has more moderate margins, because of our higher margin multi protocol interface products and our newer low voltage interface products. Optical storage product margins are typically within range of our average product margin. The products in this family are typically proprietary, but alternative suppliers have introduced competitive solutions. Capacity utilization of our wafer fabrication facility in Milpitas, California was historically an important factor in driving gross margin improvement. In the past, a large portion of our fabrication cost structure was fixed, such as depreciation and payroll expense for process engineering and manufacturing support, and this structure provided for lower per unit costs as the volume of completed wafers increased. In the third quarter of 2005, we decided to outsource all of our wafer fabrication operations and in October 2006, we completed the shut down of our Milpitas, 25 Table of Contents California wafer fabrication facility. We believe that this transition to an outsourced or fabless manufacturing model will improve the overall margins of our interface and certain of our commodity market power management products which we historically manufactured at the Milpitas facility. However, because of this transition away from a fixed cost structure in a captive wafer fab, we may not recognize the same decrease in per unit manufacturing costs as production volumes increase. Cost reductions and productivity improvements are required in order to remain competitive in our marketplace. Cost reductions are achieved in several ways, such as re designing the products to shrink the size of the die providing more individual products per wafer produced. This generates increased output without adding significant incremental cost. Other cost reductions and productivity improvements come through product assembly and test yield improvements and test time reductions. New product introductions represent a key driver of opportunities to improve our product margins. New products are typically proprietary in nature and therefore command a stronger market position and we typically have higher product margins. In 2006, we introduced 69 new products, 15 of which were proprietary in nature. We continuously strive to improve our product mix toward higher margin products by eliminating older legacy products and by focusing on increasing sales of our newer products introduced in our three core product families. Net sales of our three core product families were $78.7 million, $72.1 million, and $74.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net sales attributed to legacy products were $0.1 million, $0.6 million, and $0.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our wafer fabrication operation in Milpitas produced approximately 45%, 84% and 81% of our wafer requirements in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our wafer fabrication utilization in Milpitas was 58%, 56%, and 62% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Wafer production declined by 20%, 12% and 10% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as compared to each prior year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to change, which include revenue recognition, inventory valuation, restructurings and impairments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. We have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Prior to January 1, 2004, we entered into arrangements that were not within the original contractual distributor agreements in that we allowed return rights and other concessions beyond the levels provided in the distributor agreements. As a result, our management concluded it is unable to reasonably estimate sales returns for arrangements with its distributors; accordingly, effective January 1, 2003, sales and related cost of sales on shipments to distributors are deferred until the resale to the end customer. Sales to Future are made under an agreement that provides protection against price reductions of Sipexs products in Futures inventory. In addition, Future has stock rotation rights. Pursuant to these stock rotation rights, 26 Table of Contents Future is permitted on a quarterly basis to return for credit up to 5% of its total purchases during the most recent three month period (reduced from 10%, effective April 1, 2006). In addition, effective April 1, 2006, Future is permitted a quarterly scrap allowance credit against accounts receivable for up to 2% of the most recent three month purchases when they provide evidence of destruction of inventory of Sipex products up to this quarterly amount. As the price of products sold to Future is not fixed or determinable until resold by Future to the end customer, Sipex is using sell through revenue accounting and deferring recognition of such sales and related cost of goods sold until the product is sold by Future to its customers. Under sell through revenue accounting, accounts receivable are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment to the distributor as title to the inventory is transferred upon shipment; at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms. The associated sales and cost of sales are deferred by recording deferred income (gross profit margin on these sales) as shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet. When the related product is sold by our distributors to their end customers, we recognize previously deferred income as sales and cost of sales. For non distributor customers, we recognize revenue when title to the product is transferred to the customers, which occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending upon the terms of the customer order, provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, title has transferred, collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant obligations. Provisions for returns and allowances for non distributor customers are provided for at the time product sales are recognized. An allowance for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating an allowance. From time to time, we develop custom products for various customers under engineering service contracts culminating in delivery of known functional development samples. We recognize revenue under these agreements upon delivery of known functional development samples as delivery of such represents the culmination of utility of the contract to the customer and agreed to milestones. We recognize the costs as incurred associated with these contracts and present such costs as research and development expenses due to the uncertain nature of the development efforts until delivery of the known functional development samples. Certain of these engineering service contracts include payments in advance of delivery of known functional development samples. These payments are recorded in deferred income, other, until the time of delivery of the functional samples. Valuation of Inventories. Sipex writes down the value of its inventories for estimated excess quantities, obsolescence, and or marketability deficiencies. In addition, we write down inventory costs to the lower of cost or market which becomes the new cost basis. Excess and obsolete inventories are determined by comparing current inventory quantities to current backlog, anticipated future demand and shipment history. We also evaluate the net realizable value of inventories to be acquired under purchase commitments with our wafer foundries. If such inventories are also considered to be excess when compared to future demand, we record reserves and charges to cost of sales for these purchase commitments. Lower of cost or market adjustments are determined by reviewing shipments during the quarter as well as quarter beginning backlog and comparing standard cost to anticipated market pricing. In estimating anticipated market pricing, we also consider current market conditions, industry performance, distributor inventory levels and sales to end users and other relevant factors. If actual market conditions become less favorable than those anticipated by management, additional write downs of inventories may be required in the future. Inventories, which had previously been written down to zero, with an original cost of $1.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, were sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company recorded inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventories of $5.0 million, $5.0 million and $8.6 million, during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, during 2006, the Company recorded $1.4 million of charges to cost of sales for purchase commitments for excess inventories. Restructuring and Fixed Asset Impairment. The determination of the estimated restructuring accrual and impairment requires significant management judgment. To estimate the restructuring accrual, we prepare a plan that includes the number of employees to be terminated and the related severance cost, the amount of impairment for certain fixed assets, the termination costs of certain leases and the related actions required to execute the plan. It is possible that future events such as voluntary employee terminations, sublease agreements or a shift in the timing of the execution of the plan could result in significant changes to the original estimate. 27 Table of Contents We account for restructuring charges in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The restructuring reserve represents the present value of future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less any estimated sublease income net of associated costs. However, due to the uncertainty of collectibility, our sublease income is recorded on a cash basis. In December 2006, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce the workforce by approximately 75 positions. This reduction was part of a strategic restructuring plan implemented in response to our transition to a fabless semiconductor company and in an effort to de emphasize optical products, reduce dependency on our commodity products and with a goal to improve cost structure. As a result, we recognized restructuring charges of approximately $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to this plan representing severance costs for the reduction in our workforce. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment in accordance with the guidelines of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If impairment is indicated, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In estimating future net cash flows, management makes certain assumptions including future sales levels, gross profit margins and expense levels and proceeds from disposition. The future net cash flows can vary from original management estimates due to unforeseen circumstances that may result in additional impairment charges required to be recognized in the income statement. In the second quarter of 2005, we tested our wafer fabrication asset grouping, for which cash flows from the wafer fabrication operations provide the lowest level of cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of our other assets and liabilities, for recoverability in accordance with SFAS No. 144 given that an appraisal indicated the carrying amount of the asset grouping may not be recoverable. An impairment loss of $9.4 million was recognized, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the wafer fabrication asset grouping which management determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm. In August 2005, our board of directors approved terminating the wafer fabrication operations and the sale of the related assets. Also in August 2005, we identified a potential buyer, Silan, who would purchase, take title to and be trained to use a substantial portion of our wafer fabrication asset grouping by the end of the third quarter of 2006. Accordingly, we continued to use the wafer fabrication assets until September 2006 and recorded depreciation expense based on the estimated remaining useful life at the time of impairment. In September 2005, we tested our Milpitas corporate headquarters facility given an appraisal indicated that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Our headquarters facility housed the wafer fabrication operations as well as the sales and marketing department, the research and development department and the corporate administration functions. Our Milpitas corporate headquarters facility does not have identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of our cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Accordingly, our Milpitas corporate headquarters facility, which includes all assets located at the Milpitas facility except for the wafer fabrication asset grouping, is included in the asset grouping which includes all of our assets and liabilities. No impairment loss was recognized given the carrying value of all of our assets and liabilities was less than the fair value, determined based on the quoted market value of Sipex. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. 28 Table of Contents In assessing the net realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become taxable. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets were deductible, management assessed that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at December 30, 2006 will not be realized in the future. Therefore, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Results of Operations For the periods indicated, the following table sets forth the percentages of net sales represented by the respective line items in our consolidated statements of operations. Years Ended 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 88.1 81.1 84.4 Gross profit 11.9 18.9 15.6 Operating expenses: Research and development 22.0 23.7 19.5 Marketing and selling 19.7 14.6 11.4 General and administrative 17.1 19.8 13.0 Restructuring and impairment 2.4 13.8 2.3 Total operating expenses 61.2 71.9 46.2 Loss from operations (49.3 ) (53.0 ) (30.6 ) Other income (expense), net (2.9 ) 0.8 0.3 Loss before income taxes (52.2 )% (52.2 )% (30.3 )% Fiscal Year Ended December 30, 2006 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales. The table in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements shows details of our net sales by product family and geographic location for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Net sales increased by 8.4% to $78.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2006, as compared to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net sales was due to a $6.1 million increase in net sales for the interface product family, and a $3.8 million increase in net sales for the power management product family, partially offset by a $3.3 million decline in net sales for the optical storage product family. The increase in net sales for the interface product family was driven by an increase in unit volume shipments, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices for this product family. The decline in average selling prices was driven by pricing pressures in the commodity related interface products. The increase in unit volume shipments was driven by gains in market share in this product category. The increase in net sales for the power management product family was driven by an increase in average selling prices as our mix of product sales shifted toward higher value proprietary products away from commodity power management products. The decline in net sales of our optical product family was driven by a reduction in unit volume shipments as certain product programs approached the end of their product life cycles. Geographically during 2006, international net sales were $62.7 million or 80% of total net sales, as compared to $58.0 million or 80% in 2005. In 2006, sales in Japan declined by $4.7 million or 28%. This decline was principally driven by a decline in the optical storage product family. In Asia, other than Japan, net sales increased by $9.0 million or 35% related to growth in the interface and power management product families. Net sales in Europe 29 Table of Contents and the rest of the world increased by $0.4 million or 2%, in 2006. Domestic net sales increased by $1.4 million or 9% in 2006. Gross Profit (Loss). Gross profit decreased to $9.4 million in 2006 or 12% of net sales, as compared to $13.7 million or 19% in 2005. The reduction in gross profit was partially driven by a decline in standard gross profit due to a mix shift toward higher volumes of lower margin commodity products resulting in approximately $1.5 million of gross profit reduction. The gross profit was further reduced by approximately $2.9 million of added manufacturing yield and price variances as well as additional inventory write downs, purchase commitments on excess inventories and warranty reserves of $1.4 million. These additional costs were partially offset by $1.0 million of lower manufacturing overhead spending variances and a $0.5 million recovery of previously paid royalty costs. Research and Development. Research and development expenses in 2006 were $17.3 million compared to $17.2 million in 2005. The increase of $0.1 million was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expenses of $1.2 million (due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006) along with higher salaries, benefits and employee travel costs of approximately $283,000 and higher spending on design automation software licenses of approximately $262,000. These higher costs were partially offset by reduced spending on prototype wafers and product development costs of approximately $650,000, an approximately $494,000 reduction in facilities costs, an approximately $324,000 reduction in outside design services costs and an approximately $200,000 reduction in depreciation expenses. As a percentage of net sales, research and development costs were 22.0% in 2006 compared to 23.7% in the prior year. This percentage reduction was due to the increase in net sales in 2006. We anticipate that research and development spending will decline in 2007, as we focus our research and development efforts in the power management and interface product families. Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expenses were $15.5 million in 2006 compared to $10.6 million in 2005. The increase of $4.9 million was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in higher salary and benefits costs of approximately $2,960,000, along with approximately $816,000 for stock based compensation expenses (due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006). In addition, the increased sales and marketing headcount resulted in an approximately $501,000 increase in travel costs. Finally, the increase in net sales drove an approximately $385,000 increase in sales commissions paid to independent sales representatives. These increases were primarily due to increased sales and marketing efforts to grow our net sales. Marketing and selling expenses were 19.7% of net sales in 2006 compared to 14.6% of net sales in 2005. This percentage increase was primarily driven by marketing and selling expenses increasing at a higher percentage rate than the increase in the net sales growth rate in 2006 along with the increase in expenses. We anticipate that marketing and selling expenses will decline in 2007, as we focus our efforts in the power management and interface product families. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $13.5 million in 2006 compared to $14.4 million in 2005 or a decrease of $0.9 million. This decrease was principally due to a reduction in legal fees of approximately $1,706,000 associated with the completion of the internal investigation and resolution of related litigation, a reduction in audit and consulting fees of approximately $994,000 related to the completion of the financial restatement process filing our financial reports with the SEC, and a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $340,000 associated with the collection of amounts previously reserved as bad debts. These expense reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of stock based compensation expense of approximately $1,266,000 (due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006) and higher salary and benefits costs of approximately $1.0 million. General and administrative expenses were 17.1% of net sales in 2006 compared to 19.8% of net sales in 2005. This percentage decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in these expenses along with an increase in net sales in 2006. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decline in 2007. Restructuring and Fixed Asset Impairment. During the year ended December 30, 2006, we incurred additional restructuring costs of $677,000 that related to employee retention payments for the closure of the wafer fabrication operations located in Milpitas, California, announced in August 2005. For employee costs, we utilized $1.4 million and recognized an accrual expense adjustment of $54,000. We recognized approximately $200,000 in expense for contract termination in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with gas usage and service agreements with a vendor. For facility costs related to the Milpitas wafer fabrication closure, restructuring charges utilized during 2006 totaling $91,000 was for facility decontamination. Additionally, the Company incurred 30 Table of Contents $116,000 of facility costs related to the unused fabrication portion of the Companys corporate headquarters facility in Milpitas, California, due to the transfer of wafer fabrication to Silan. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we announced a workforce reduction plan that was implemented in response to our transitioning to a fabless semiconductor company, de emphasizing optical products, reducing dependency on our commodity products and with a goal of improving cost structure. As a result, we recorded total restructuring costs of $1.1 million related to employee severance compensation, including $0.1 million for vesting acceleration of stock options in lieu of a severance payment to a senior executive officer. Of the $1.0 million (excluding the stock based compensation charge), $0.1 million was paid during December 2006. In 2006, we utilized restructuring accruals of $726,000 for the unused portion of the Billerica facility. The adjustment to the accrual for the Billerica facility primarily related to sub lease income of $565,000 being received. As of December 30, 2006, the balance of the restructuring accrual principally consisted of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and facility lease costs, which are anticipated to be paid over the next 15 months. The balance of the accrual as of December 30, 2006 was $1.8 million, of which $1.7 million was the short term portion and $0.1 million was the long term portion. The following is a summary of the activities related to accrued restructuring costs and fixed asset impairment for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): Total Restructuring Fixed Asset Costs Impairment Accrual balance January 1, 2005 $ 1,847 $ Incurred 2005 871 9,377 Charges utilized (726 ) (9,377 ) Sub lease income received 293 Adjustments to accrual (294 ) Accrual balance December 31, 2005 1,991 Incurred in 2006 2,010 Charges utilized (2,299 ) (12 ) Employee stock options accelerated as severance pay (137 ) Sub lease income received 565 Adjustments to accrual (263 ) 12 Accrual balance, December 30, 2006 $ 1,867 $ Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net was $2.2 million of net other expense in 2006 compared to $0.6 million of net other income in the prior year. The increase in other expense, was primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in interest expense, $1.9 million of which related to the convertible senior notes issued in May 2006 and $0.9 million of which related to the lease financing obligation executed in March 2006. The interest expense was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in interest income attributable to higher balances of interest bearing cash equivalents and short term investments from the proceeds of the convertible senior notes. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense primarily relates to our foreign operations as we continue to incur losses from domestic operations. In 2006, we recorded an income tax provision of $125,000, compared to a provision of $192,000 in 2005. Notwithstanding our net operating losses, we did not record a tax benefit as we believed that it was more likely than not, considering the level of historical taxable income and expectations for future taxable income, that the operating loss would not be utilized in the future. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 1, 2005 Net Sales. Net sales decreased by 3.7% to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $75.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2005. The decrease in net sales was due to a $2.2 million decline in net sales for the power management product line and a $1.1 million decline in the interface product line, partially offset 31 Table of Contents by a $0.8 million increase in the optical storage product line. The decrease in net sales of the power product line was driven by an overall softness in demand that led to a unit volume decline as well as a decline in average selling prices. The decline in demand for the commodity products was only partially offset by increasing demand for our proprietary power management products. The decline in net sales of the interface product line was driven by a decline in average selling prices while unit volume increased. The increase in net sales for the optical storage product line was primarily driven by an increase in unit volume as demand for these products was strong. Geographically during 2005, international net sales were $58.0 million or 80% of total net sales, as compared to $60.3 million or 80% in 2004. In 2005, sales in Japan declined by $1.7 million or 9%. This decline was driven by declines in power management and interface products off set by increases in optical storage products. In Asia, other than Japan, net sales decreased by $1.3 million or 5% related to the declines in power management and interface. Net sales in Europe and the rest of the world increased by $0.7 million or 5%, in 2005. Domestic net sales declined by $0.5 million or 3% in 2005. Gross Profit (Loss). Gross profit increased to $13.7 million in 2005 or 19% of net sales, as compared to $11.8 million or approximately 16% in 2004. The improvement in gross profit was comprised of improvements in manufacturing yields lowering overall product costs as well as reductions in inventory write downs for excess and obsolete products. These cost reductions were offset by recognition of $4.3 million of increased depreciation on the Milpitas, California facility after determination that the facility had a shorter economic useful life to Sipex recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005. The improvement in gross profit was comprised of the following: product mix, higher margins at standard cost due to manufacturing yield and process improvements. Research and Development. Research and development expenses in 2005 were $17.2 million compared to $14.7 million in 2004. The increase of $2.5 million was primarily due to increased product development costs for outside design services costs of approximately $893,000 and prototype wafers costs of approximately $665,000. In addition, approximately $1.1 million of increased depreciation for the reduction in the economic life of the Milpitas, California facility was recorded in 2005. As a percentage of net sales, research and development costs were 23.7% in 2005 compared to 19.5% in the prior year. This was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses along with the lower net sales in 2005. Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expenses were $10.6 million in 2005 compared to $8.6 million in 2004. The increase of $2.0 million was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in higher salary and benefits costs of approximately $1,147,000, marketing activities and travel costs of approximately $440,000. In addition, approximately $313,000 of increased depreciation for the reduction in the economic life of the Milpitas, California facility was recorded in 2005. These increases were primarily due to increased sales and marketing efforts for our core product families. Marketing and selling expenses were 14.6% of net sales in 2005 compared to 11.4% of net sales in 2004. This was primarily due to the decline in net sales in 2005 as well as the increase in expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $14.4 million in 2005 compared to $9.8 million in 2004 or an increase of $4.6 million. This increase was principally due to increase of approximately $2,320,000 of legal fees associated with the internal investigation and related litigation, approximately $707,000 of consulting and audit fees related to the financial restatement process and approximately $400,000 of higher salary and benefits costs as well as bad debt expense of approximately $256,000. In addition, approximately $707,000 of increased depreciation for the reduction in the economic life of the Milpitas, California facility was recorded in 2005. Restructuring and Fixed Asset Impairment. During the year ended January 1, 2005, we incurred restructuring expenses reflecting the continuation of our plans initiated in 2003 to move our manufacturing operations from Billerica, Massachusetts to Milpitas, California. These restructuring expenses consisted of $1.4 million for future lease payments, $447,000 write off of leasehold improvements and $32,000 for severance payments. For the same period, we utilized $1.0 million of restructuring reserves, which was primarily the $447,000 write off of leasehold improvements, and $463,000 of lease costs associated with the unused portion of our Billerica facility. We made additional adjustments to the restructuring for changes to the lease obligation totaling $60,000. For the year ended January 1, 2005, the balance of the restructuring accrual principally consisted of facility lease costs, and was expected to be paid over the next three years. The balance as of the year ended January 1, 2005 was $1.8 million, of which $566,000 was the short term portion and $1.3 million was long term portion. 32 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2005, Sipex recognized a $9.4 million impairment charge for its long lived assets. Based on changes in the planned use for its wafer fabrication assets, we performed an impairment evaluation in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Sipex determined that the appropriate grouping for this impairment evaluation was the wafer fabrication assets taken together and the associated cash flows for these assets. These assets were evaluated on a held for use basis as we were required to operate our wafer fabrication facility until new wafer fabrication partner processes were qualified. As the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows of the wafer fabrication assets for the period of planned use by us, an impairment charge was recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the wafer fabrication assets which management determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm. While we subsequently agreed to sell a substantial portion of its wafer fabrication machinery and equipment to Silan by the end of the third quarter of 2006, the wafer fabrication assets remain in use and Sipex will continue to record depreciation expense based on the estimated remaining useful life at the time of impairment. In August 2005, our board of directors approved a plan to close our wafer fabrication operations located in Milpitas, California and transfer the fabrication to Silan in China, Episil in Taiwan and other vendors to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. As a result, we recognized total restructuring charges of approximately $871,000 in the second half of 2005 including severance and retention benefits totaling $766,000 for approximately 70 employees and other exit costs of $105,000. In addition, during the third quarter of 2005, Sipex decided not to transfer the remaining operations in Billerica to Milpitas that was originally anticipated to be completed by the end of 2005. The adjustment to the restructuring accrual of $294,000 during 2005 primarily included exiting costs of $213,000, offset by sublease income of $293,000 and $195,000 recorded in the third quarter of 2005 as a reduction to future lease payment obligation for not transferring such remaining operations in Billerica. Sublease income is recorded on a cash basis due to the uncertainty of collectibility. The restructuring accrual balance as of December 31, 2005 consisted of a short term portion of $1.4 million and a long term portion of $584,000. The $2.0 million restructuring accrual balance included $1.2 million of facility lease costs to be paid out over the next two years and the remaining portion to be paid out in less than a year. In November 2005, based on the previous decision to close our wafer fabrication operation located at the Milpitas, California headquarters facility, we decided to sell this facility. As a result of a decision, we reduced the remaining estimated depreciation life for our headquarters building and related improvements from 25 years to approximately four months. This change resulted in an increase in depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $6.5 million (including $4.3 million included in cost of sales). The following is a summary of the activity related to accrued restructuring costs and fixed asset impairment for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 (in thousands): Total Restructuring Fixed Asset Costs Impairment Accrual balance December 31, 2003 $ 1,070 $ Incurred 2004 1,858 Charges utilized (1,036 ) Deferred rent adjustment 15 Adjustments to accrual (60 ) Accrual balance January 1, 2005 1,847 Incurred 2005 871 9,377 Charges utilized (726 ) (9,377 ) Sub lease income received 293 Adjustments to accrual (294 ) Accrual balance December 31, 2005 $ 1,991 $ Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net was $0.6 million in 2005 compared to $185,000 in the prior year. The increase in other income (expense), net was attributable to higher interest income on short 33 Table of Contents term investments, other income and lower interest expense associated with the two convertible notes with Future (See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for Related Parties). Both convertible notes were extinguished and converted into 2.3 million of our common shares as of February 18, 2004. Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense primarily relates to our foreign operations as we continue to incur losses from domestic operations. In 2005, we recorded an income tax provision of $192,000 in contrast to an income tax benefit of $133,000 in 2004 due to a reversal of the previously established expected tax liability from our off shore operations, primarily Belgium. Notwithstanding our net operating losses, we did not record a tax benefit as we believed that it was more likely than not, considering the level of historical taxable income and expectations for future taxable income, that the operating loss would not be utilized in the future to offset taxable income. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 30, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, were $15.4 million as compared to $2.0 million at December 31, 2005. The increase of $13.5 million was principally due to our net cash inflows from financing activities during 2006 of $43.5 million along with a reduction in restricted cash of $0.6 million, partially offset by our net cash outflows from operations of $27.9 million along with our cash payments for capital expenditures of $3.8 million. The two most significant sources of cash from financing activities were the net proceeds from our convertible debt offering completed in May 2006 of $28.7 million and the $12.6 million net proceeds from our lease financing obligation completed in March 2006. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $27.9 million, $17.4 million, and $8.9 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We will continue to depend upon our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations until such time that we generate cash from operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities of $27.9 million in 2006 resulted primarily from a $41.2 million net loss and the unfavorable impact of a $9.3 million net change in assets and liabilities, partially offset by $22.6 million of non cash adjustments to net loss. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily included an increase in inventory of $7.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, decreases in accrued restructuring costs of $1.9 million and accrued expenses of $1.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $2.8 million, respectively. Non cash adjustments primarily comprised depreciation and amortization of $9.4 million, a $5.0 million provision for inventories and $1.4 million purchase commitments on excess inventories, $3.8 million of stock based compensation expense as a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, effective January 1, 2006, a $1.6 million net provision for restructuring costs, a provision for uncollectible receivables and sales returns and allowances of $0.9 million, and $0.5 million for amortization of the notes payable discount and issuance costs. Net cash used in operating activities of $17.4 million in 2005 resulted primarily from a $38.1 million net loss and the unfavorable impact of a $6.9 million net change in assets and liabilities, partially offset by $27.5 million of non cash adjustments to net loss. The changes in assets and liabilities included an increase in inventory of $5.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $3.4 million, a decrease in deferred income of $1.2 million and a decrease in accrued restructuring costs of $433,000, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.7 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $1.4 million, respectively. The $1.2 million decrease in deferred income comprises of a decrease of $0.2 million from Future and a decrease of $1.0 million from other distributors. Non cash adjustments primarily comprised depreciation and amortization of $11.0 million, $9.4 million of fixed asset impairment charges, and a $5.0 million provision for inventories, a provision for uncollectible receivables and sales returns and allowances of $1.5 million, and a $577,000 net provision for restructuring costs. Net cash used in operating activities of $8.9 million in 2004 resulted primarily from a $22.7 million net loss and increase of $4.6 million in net assets and liabilities, partially offset by $18.5 million of non cash adjustments to net loss. The changes in assets and liabilities included an increase in inventory of $5.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $0.9 million, a decreases in accrued restructuring costs of $608,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses of $1.4 million, an increase of deferred income of $620,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $391,000. The $620,000 increase in deferred income comprises of an increase of $1.1 million from Future offset by a decrease of $449,000 from other distributors. Non cash adjustments primarily comprised 34 Table of Contents $8.6 million provision for inventories, depreciation and amortization of $6.6 million, provision for uncollectible receivables and sales returns and allowances of $1.3 million, and a $1.8 million net provision for restructuring costs. Accounts receivable, net of allowances, was $7.2 million and $6.7 million as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The allowances for accounts receivable decreased to $0.9 million for 2006 from $1.3 million for 2005 primarily due to lower sales allowances for product returns. In 2006, we recorded inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventories of $5.0 million. Similarly, we recorded write downs of $5.0 million and $8.6 million, in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, during 2006, we recorded $1.4 million of charges to cost of sales for purchase commitments for excess inventories. Inventories previously written off with an original cost of $1.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, were sold in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, we began the transfer of our manufacturing processes to foundries operated by Silan in China and Episil in Taiwan in conjunction with the planned closure of our Milpitas, California wafer fabrication facility in 2006. The transfer has been a complicated and time consuming process that has been met with significant unforeseen complications that delayed the integration transfer and required additional allocation of our resources. In 2006, we incurred approximately $1.6 million of manufacturing process transfer and qualification costs, as reflected in cost of sales. We anticipate that we will continue to incur similar costs in the future. There can be no guarantees that additional unforeseen integration issues will not arise in the future related to the integration that could cause additional delays which could materially adversely affect our ability to timely produce our products. In addition, we may be unable to achieve all or any of the expected benefits of the relationship within the anticipated time frames. The anticipated synergies between Sipex and Silan or Episil may not be as significant as originally expected. We may be unable to qualify the manufacturing processes and wafer testing following the transfer from Sipex to Silan or Episil or the qualification process may take significantly longer than currently expected. This could result in additional operating costs, loss of customers, and business disruption. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was $4.4 million, consisting of $8.0 million of purchases of short term investment securities and $3.8 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $5.6 million from the proceeds of maturities of short term securities, $1.1 million for the sale of machinery and equipment and $593,000 from reductions in restricted cash. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2005 was $209,000, consisting of $850,000 proceeds from maturities of short term securities, $838,000 from reductions in restricted cash, offset by $878,000 of capital expenditures and $601,000 of purchases of short term investment securities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2004 was $1.0 million, consisting of $6.3 million purchases of short term securities, purchase of property, plant and equipment of $1.9 million and $1.8 million of deposit to restricted cash to meet a contractual obligation with a vendor, mostly offset by the $9.0 million proceeds from maturity of short term securities. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was $43.5 million, resulting primarily from $28.7 million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and warrants, $12.6 million of net proceeds from lease financing obligation, $7.0 million of proceeds from related party borrowings, $3.4 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of warrants relating to the 2006 convertible notes and employee stock option plans, and $2.0 million from the proceeds from bank borrowings. These cash inflows were partially offset by $7.0 million of repayments of related party borrowings, $3.0 million of repayments of bank borrowing in 2005 under our bank line of credit and $0.2 million of payments against our lease financing obligation. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 was $3.7 million, resulting primarily from $3.0 million of borrowings under our bank line of credit and $0.7 million of net proceeds from issuance of common stock under 35 Table of Contents employee stock option plans. As of December 31, 2005, we violated the tangible net worth covenant under our bank line of credit. However, the borrowings of $3.0 million were subsequently repaid in January 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was $7.1 million, resulting primarily from $2.7 million of net proceeds from the exercise of warrants relating to the 2002 convertible notes and $4.4 million of net proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock option plans. On July 21, 2005, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank, and this agreement was subsequently amended on October 7, 2005, November 10, 2005, January 19, 2006, May 18, 2006, August 1, 2006 and September 28, 2006. The agreement currently provides for a secured revolving line of credit with an aggregate principal amount of up to $5,000,000, which may be used to borrow revolving loans or to issue lines of credit on our behalf. We have granted to Silicon Valley Bank a security interest in all presently existing and later acquired collateral, including but not limited to goods, equipment, inventory, contract rights, and financial assets, in order to secure the obligations and duties under such loan and security agreement. Advances accrue interest on the outstanding principal balance at an annual rate, decided by us, either equal to Silicon Valley Banks prime rate or LIBOR rate (depending upon the interest period of one, two or three months selected by us) plus 2.75%. In addition to the $5,000,000 secured revolving line of credit, we can borrow under term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000,000. Each term loan shall be in an amount not less than $500,000. The number of term loans shall not exceed two (2). Interest accrues from the date of each term loan at a rate of 9.25%. Each term loan shall be payable in thirty six (36) equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest. When repaid or prepaid, the term loan may not be re borrowed. As of December 30, 2006, the unused portion of our line of credit was $3,735,000, and a $2,000,000 term loan was outstanding. The agreement with Silicon Valley Bank has been extended to September 29, 2007 at which time all outstanding advances must be repaid, and all outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement requires us to comply with a minimum liquidity ratio of 2.50:1.00 at each fiscal quarter end. It also requires us to retain a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The liquidity ratio is calculated as the sum of (i) Sipexs unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short term marketable securities and 50% of consolidated Accounts divided by (ii) the Obligations. Sipex must maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter set forth below, a tangible net worth of at least the amount set forth below for each fiscal quarter ending date. For purposes of this calculation, up to $5,000,000 in an aggregate amount of non cash charges relating to inventory write downs and or restructuring charges may be added to tangible net worth. Fiscal quarter ending date: September 30, 2006, minimum tangible net worth: $600,000; fiscal quarter ending date: December 30, 2006, minimum tangible net worth (deficit): ( $5,500,000); fiscal quarter ending date: March 31, 2007, minimum tangible net worth (deficit): ( $10,000,000); fiscal quarter ending date: June 30, 2007, minimum tangible net worth (deficit): ( $13,000,000); Each fiscal quarter thereafter, minimum tangible net worth (deficit): ( $13,000,000) plus 50% of any positive net income (with no adjustment for losses) and 50% of any new equity raised. The agreement contains additional affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the agreement contains negative covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets, change our business plans, be acquired or beneficially owned, merge or consolidate, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, pay dividends, repurchase stock, and pay subordinated debt. The agreement contains events of default that include, among others, non payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violations of covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency events, any material adverse change, material judgments, cross defaults to certain other indebtedness and seizure of assets. The occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by 5.0% and would, unless waived by Silicon Valley Bank, result in the immediate payment of all of our obligations under the agreement. As of December 30, 2006, total borrowing with Silicon Valley Bank was $2.0 million, of which $667,000 was the short term portion and $1.3 million was the long term portion. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant requirements and to obtain a waiver from the bank, we may be required to repay the outstanding borrowing amounts and or classify such amounts as short term bank borrowing. On January 19, 2006, we announced the completion of a $7.0 million private loan financing in which we issued a 9% secured note with convertible interest due January 19, 2008 to Rodfre, an affiliate of Future. The note was 36 Table of Contents secured by a deed of trust on our headquarters property located in Milpitas, California. The holder of the note could require repayment of the loan in the event of, among other things, the sale of the property subject to the deed of trust. On March 9, 2006, we entered into an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Real Property with Mission West Properties, L.P. The agreement provides for the sale of Sipexs Hillview facility to Mission West Properties, L.P. for a price of $13.4 million in cash (net proceeds of $12.6 million). We used the proceeds from the sale of our Hillview facility to pay off and terminate the $7.0 million loan with Future. The remaining balance of $6.4 million from the sale of the property was used for operating activities. Simultaneously with the sale of the Hillview property in March 2006, we entered into a Standard Form Lease agreement to lease back the facility from Mission West Properties, L.P. The lease term is 60 months. In addition, we provided a security deposit of $1,265,000 in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to Mission West Properties, L.P. under our line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. The security deposit is held as security for our faithful performance of the terms, covenants, and conditions prescribed under the lease agreement. On May 16, 2006, we placed $30.0 million of 5.5% Redeemable Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, or the 2006 Notes, in a private placement. The 2006 Notes bear interest of 5.5% per year, payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2006, and mature on May 16, 2026. The 2006 Notes are convertible into common stock at any time at a fixed conversion price of $5.36 per share. If fully converted, the principal amount of the 2006 Notes would convert into approximately 5,597,015 shares of our common stock. At any time following the effectiveness of a registration statement related to the resale of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 2006 Notes, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect to automatically convert the 2006 Notes into common stock if the average price of our common stock exceeds 150% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, ending within 5 days of the notice of automatic conversion. We have the right to redeem the 2006 Notes at par plus accrued interest at anytime after May 15, 2009 and the purchasers have the right to require us to repurchase the 2006 Notes at par plus accrued interest on May 15 in 2011, 2016 and 2021. The 2006 Notes are convertible into Sipexs common stock at any time prior to maturity, initially at a conversion price of $5.36 per share, subject to adjustment upon certain events, including, among other things, dividends, stock splits and recapitalizations. If fully converted, the principal amount of the 2006 Notes would convert into 5,597,015 shares of the Companys common stock. The 2006 Notes contains certain covenants including a covenant restricting the amount of indebtedness that we can incur that is senior or pari passu with the 2006 Notes to an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 million, unless such restriction is waived by holders of over 662/3% of the principal amount of the 2006 Notes then outstanding. Additionally, an event of default would occur under the 2006 Notes for a number of reasons, including our failure to pay when due any principal, interest or late charges on the 2006 Notes, the default and acceleration of indebtedness with our bank and other lenders in amounts greater than $2.5 million, certain events of bankruptcy and our breach or failure to perform certain representations and obligations under the 2006 Notes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our obligations under the 2006 Notes may become due and payable in accordance with the terms thereof. The 2006 Notes provide that since we were not current in our SEC filings by August 15, 2006, we incurred additional interest on the 2006 Notes at an annual rate of 1.5% for the period beginning August 16, 2006 through the date that our filings became current. The Company filed all its late Forms 10 K and 10 Q to the SEC by September 21, 2006. In addition, as our common stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, the New York Stock Exchange or another national exchange or automated quotation system by December 31, 2006, we will pay additional interest on the 2006 Notes at an annual rate of 1.5% for the period beginning January 1, 2007 through the date that our common stock becomes listed for trading on one of the national exchanges. Likewise, the Registration Rights Agreement entered into in connection with the 2006 Notes provides that since we have not filed a registration statement for the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2006 Notes or exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the 2006 Notes as of August 15, 2006, we must pay additional payments to the noteholders equal to a per annum rate of 0.8% times the principal amount of the 2006 Notes for the period beginning on August 16, 2006 through the date that the registration statement is filed. However, we have to pay increased interest payments at an annual rate of 1.2% as the filing of the registration statement was delayed by over 60 days, and the registration statement was not declared effective by December 31, 2006. We have not filed a registration 37 Table of Contents statement as contemplated in the Registration Rights Agreement. Our common stock is not listed on any one of the national exchanges. As a result of our failure to meet these conditions, we are effectively obligated to pay up to an additional 2.7% of interest on the notes and our current effective interest rate is 8.2% per annum. A more detailed description of the terms of the 2006 Notes is presented in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this 10 K filing. On March 29, 2007, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Rodfre, an affiliate of Future, our largest distributor worldwide and an affiliate of our largest stockholder (Alonim Investment Inc.), to provide an unsecured promissory note facility of up to $10.0 million. This facility expires, and the borrowings and accrued interest under any notes issued under this facility are due and payable, on June 30, 2008, or upon certain other events such as a change of control. Borrowings under this promissory note facility bear interest of 9% per annum subject to an increased interest rate of up to 20% in case of default or after maturity. This promissory note facility is subordinate to our Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and to our 5.5% Redeemable Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments together with available borrowings under our bank line of credit and unsecured promissory note facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months. In addition, if desirable or necessary, we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity. There can be no assurances, however, that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all. Our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products, timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital, especially inventory and accounts receivable, as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement As of December 30, 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a) (4) of the SECs Regulation S K except for the $1,265,000 security deposit in the form of irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to Mission West Properties, L.P. as described under Interest Rate Risk. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 30, 2006 were as follows (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Convertible note payable(1): Principal $ 30,000 $ $ $ $ 30,000 Interest 32,654 2,129 3,300 3,300 23,925 Long term lease financing obligation(2) 5,797 1,329 2,776 1,692 Restructuring liability(3) 771 617 154 Operating leases(4) 1,642 676 627 315 24 Purchase commitment Polar Fab 3,653 3,653 Purchase commitment Cadence Design 974 857 117 Verification software tools Mentor Graphics 419 157 262 Other(5) 2,022 1,964 58 Total contractual obligations $ 77,932 $ 11,382 $ 7,294 $ 5,307 $ 53,949 (1) $30.0 million Convertible Senior Notes issued on March 18, 2006 due May 18, 2026 with 5.5% interest payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year beginning on November 15, 2006. 38 Table of Contents (2) Lease payments (excluding $11.2 million estimated final obligation settlement with the lessor by returning the Hillview facility due on our Hillview facility in Milpitas, California) under a 5 year Standard Form Lease agreement that we signed with Mission West Properties L.P. on March 9, 2006. (3) Represents estimated lease payments with related costs for the unused portion of our Billerica, Massachusetts facility. (4) Includes lease payments related to the used portion of our facility at our Billerica, Massachusetts facility. (5) Includes wafer and part purchases as well as other services with various vendors including Episil and BCD Semiconductor Manufacture Limited. Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the discussion on effect of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk: Market Risk We invest excess cash in financial investments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment strategy. None of these market sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We do not own derivative financial instruments in our portfolio. The investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates. As required by our investment policy, available funds are invested in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and, secondarily, maximizes yield within such constraints. Interest Rate Risk Our financial investments consist primarily of high quality commercial paper and money market funds. We believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and interest expense we are charged on borrowings. We do not use derivative financial instruments or engage in hedging activities in our investment portfolio. We ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risks, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities. We had short term investment securities of $2.4 million as of December 30, 2006. Our short term investments consisted of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between 91 to 104 days. These investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. We believe a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by 10% from levels at December 30, 2006, would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount. Since we are not required to sell these investments before maturity, we have the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates. On the other hand, declines in the interest rates over time will reduce our interest income. On March 9, 2006, we entered into an Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Real Property with Mission West Properties, L.P. The agreement provides for the sale of our Hillview facility to Mission West Properties, L.P. for a price of $13.4 million in cash (net proceeds of $12.6 million). Simultaneously, we entered into a Standard Form Lease agreement to lease back the Hillview facility from Mission West Properties, L.P. We provided a security deposit of $1,265,000 in the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued to Mission West Properties, L.P.; accordingly, we have accounted for this sale and leaseback transaction as a financing transaction shown on the consolidated balance sheet as lease financing obligation. An effective interest rate of 9.3%, which approximates our estimated borrowing rate, is used to record the interest expense over the lease term of 60 months with average lease payments of approximately $1.4 million per year. Since the interest rate of this transaction was fixed, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates will not have a material effect on our financials. On May 16, 2006 we placed $30.0 million of 5.5% Redeemable Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. The notes provide for a fixed interest rate of 5.5%, which has been increased to, and currently fixed at 8.2% as a result of our 39 Table of Contents failure to meet certain conditions. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates will not have a material effect on our financials. A more detailed description of the terms of the 2006 Notes is provided in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this 10 K filing, and in our Form 8 K filed with the SEC on May 22, 2006. We have a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank which provides us with a line of credit up to $5.0 million and charges interest at the banks prime rate or LIBOR rate. However, we do not believe that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by 10% from current levels would result in a material increase in our overall expenses. As part of the agreement, in addition to the $5.0 million secured revolving line of credit, Sipex borrowed $2.0 million under a separate term loan during December 2006. Interest accrues at a fixed rate of 9.25% per annum. We have a promissory note facility with Rodfre which provides us with the ability to issue up to $10.0 million of promissory notes that would charge interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Since the interest rate is fixed in the promissory notes to be issued under the facility with Rodfre, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates will not have a material effect in our expenses under this promissory note facility, nor will it have a material effect on our financials. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our sales, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the U.S., we enter into transactions in other currencies. We are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and South Korean won. Currently, we have no plan to enter into any foreign currency hedging program since the amounts involved have not been material. Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. 40 Table of Contents
