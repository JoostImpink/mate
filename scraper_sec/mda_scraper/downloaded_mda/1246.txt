ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, as well as the information in Item 6, "Selected Consolidated Financial Data". Overview We are an international industrial company with two business segments: Outdoor Products and Industrial and Power Equipment ("IPEG"). Operating independently from one another, these segments focus on the manufacture and marketing of branded products to industrial companies and consumers. Our products are sold in over 100 countries. We believe we are a global leader in the sale of cutting chain and chainsaw accessories and a leading provider of timber harvesting equipment in North America. Our largest segment, Outdoor Products, accounted for 70% of our revenue in 2006. This segment manufactures and markets forestry related cutting chain, guide bars, sprockets and accessories for chainsaw use, concrete cutting equipment and accessories, and outdoor equipment parts that include lawnmower blades and other accessories. The segments products are sold to OEMs for use on new chainsaws and landscaping equipment and to the retail replacement market through distributors, dealers and mass merchants. During 2006, approximately 27% of the segments sales were to OEMs, with the remaining 73% sold into the replacement market. Approximately 65% of the segments sales were outside of the U.S. in 2006, up from 64% in 2005. The Outdoor Products segments performance can be impacted by trends in the forestry industry, weather patterns and natural disasters, foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions. The segment f aces price pressure from competitors on a worldwide basis. The maintenance of competitive selling prices is dependent on the segments ability to efficiently manufacture its products and successfully market newly developed products, such as our concrete cutting saws and replacement chain and bars. This segment operates three manufacturing plants in the U.S., one in Canada, one in Brazil and one in China, all of which are focused on continuous cost improvement. The Chinese facility was constructed in 2004, and manufacturing at this facility commenced in 2005. Production capacity for the Chinese facility was increased throughout 2006, with further expansion expected in 2007. Timely capital investment into this segments manufacturing plants for added capacity and cost reductions, as well as effectively sourcing critical raw materials at favorable prices, is required to remain competitive. The IPEG segment manufactures and markets timber harvesting equipment, industrial tractors and loaders, mobile equipment rotation bearings, worm gear reducers and swing drives. Sales in this segment accounted for 30% of our total sales in 2006. Sales are made through a dealer network to customers in the timber harvesting, materials handling and reclamation businesses and to pulp, paper and lumber mills. IPEG also markets directly to OEMs. The segments customer base is concentrated in the Southeastern U.S., with international sales amounting to 16% of segment sales in 2006. The segment distributes timber harvesting equipment under the Prentice brand to Blount affiliated dealers and Caterpillar branded equipment to Caterpillar affiliated dealers under authority of a license agreement with Caterpillar Inc. The performance of IPEG is aligned with trends in the North American forestry industry, including the import/export balance of wood products, the level of residential construction activity and its effect on the utilization of lumber, paper mill capacity and the level of logging production. The cyclical nature of the North American forestry industry can significantly impact the contribution to operating income and cash flow of IPEG from year to year. In recent years IPEG has sought to minimize its exposure to the North American forestry industry cycle by increasing distribution of products to international markets. Given the cyclical nature of the forestry industry, the segment must manage its manufacturing plants on a lean basis, maximize pricing value for its products and minimize working capital. In 2006 IPEG closed one of its smaller manufacturing facilities to improve future segment profitability and consolidated is brand offerings to better focus its marketing efforts. We maintain a corporate staff at our headquarters in Portland, Oregon. In addition to providing management oversight for the business segments, the corporate staff manages our capital structure, administers various health and welfare plans and supervises regulatory, compliance and legal matters. During 2006 we exited the Lawnmower segment business through the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our Dixon Industries, Inc. ("Dixon") subsidiary to Husqvarna Professional Outdoor Products, Inc. The Lawnmower segment is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our capital structure has experienced noteworthy changes in the past three years. In 2004, we began the year with $610.5 million of debt outstanding and a concentration of common stock ownership by Lehman Brothers, which owned approximately 85% of our stock outstanding. During 2004, we executed several refinancing transactions, reducing our total debt and increasing outstanding common stock. In 2005, as a result of secondary public offerings of our stock, Lehman Brothers had reduced its holdings to its current level of approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. In 2005 and again in 2006, we BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.14 made sizable reductions in outstanding debt by utilizing cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the sale of our former Lawnmower segment. Debt outstanding at the end of 2006 was $350.9 million. At the end of 2006, notwithstanding these changes, our debt and leverage remain significant, and require the conservation of cash in order to reduce debt and increase stockholder value. Operating Results Year ended December 31, 2006 compared to year ended December 31, 2005 The table below provides a summary of results and primary factors contributing to the year over year change in operating results. (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2006 2005 Change Contributing Factor Sales $ 651.1 $ 702.3 $ (51.2 ) $ (55.2 ) Sales volume 3.4 Price and mix 0.6 Foreign currency translation Operating income 88.3 117.8 (29.5 ) (10.0 ) Sales volume (6.6 ) Price, costs, mix, and expense (4.8 ) Foreign currency translation (5.0 ) Pension redesign and plant closure (3.2 ) Stock compensation expense Income from continuing operations 38.1 104.7 (66.6 ) (29.5 ) Decrease in operating income 1.3 Decrease in net interest expense 2.5 Change in other income/expense (40.9 ) Change in income tax provision Income from continuing operations per diluted share 0.80 2.20 (1.40 ) Income from discontinued operations 4.5 1.9 2.6 Gain on sale of net assets Income from discontinued operations per diluted share 0.09 0.04 0.05 Net income 42.5 106.6 (64.1 ) Net income per diluted share 0.89 2.24 (1.35 ) These results reflect the following: &lt; On a consolidated basis we experienced year over year decreases in sales and operating income. The decrease in sales was due to a significant slowdown in the North American forestry equipment industry that resulted in a decline in the sales of our IPEG segment. The decrease in operating income also included higher product costs, unfavorable foreign currency trends, costs related to the redesign of our pension plan and a plant closure, and the recognition of stock compensation expense under new accounting requirements. &lt; In 2006 our provision for income taxes returned to a more typical presentation compared to the unusual benefit in the previous years results. In 2005 we recognized a favorable income tax benefit to remove most of the valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets that was established in 2003. &lt; Income from discontinued operations for 2006 includes a $17.4 million pretax net gain on disposal of the Lawnmower segment. Our sales in 2006 decreased by $51.2 million, or 7%, from 2005. The following are key elements of the year over year comparison. &lt; Sales of IPEG declined by $54.1 million, or 22%, from 2005, as the U.S. and Canadian forestry industries entered a period of cyclical decline. Lower housing starts, declining lumber prices and mill closures impacted logging production in the North American markets. Demand for new timber harvesting equipment was reduced in 2006 and resulted in a $65.2 million decline in segment sales of forestry equipment in North America as compared to 2005. Offsetting some of this decline was a $5.0 million increase in the sale of timber harvesting equipment outside of North America and a 23% year over year increase in the sale of gear related products. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.15 &lt; The Outdoor Products segment experienced a $2.7 million, or 1%, increase in sales during 2006 compared to 2005. Sales in international markets increased by $6.7 million, or 2%. Included in this increase is a $0.6 million favorable impact of foreign currencies, primarily from the stronger Canadian Dollar. Segment sales within the U.S. declined by $3.9 million, or 2%, from 2005. The decline in the U.S. is attributed to weaker market conditions in the lawn care and forestry industry. Included in the segment sales growth was a 10% increase in the sale of concrete cutting products. Consolidated order backlog at December 31, 2006 was $73.3 million, a decrease from $127.5 million at December 31, 2005. The year over year decline reflects the combination of weaker market conditions, primarily in our forestry equipment business, and improved production capacity and related responsiveness to customer orders in our Outdoor Products segment. Operating income decreased by $29.5 million, or 25%, from 2005 to 2006, resulting in an operating margin for 2006 of 13.6% of sales compared to 16.8% for 2005. A comparison of the two periods reflects the following: &lt; The unfavorable effect of lower sales volume in the forestry equipment business of our IPEG segment; &lt; The unfavorable effect of higher production costs, partially offset by a net decrease in steel costs; &lt; Nonrecurring costs related to a plant closure and the redesign of our U.S. retirement plans; and &lt; The unfavorable net effect of currency exchange rates, primarily due to a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to the Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian Real. The decrease in operating income reflects a year over year decrease in gross profit of $23.7 million. Our gross margin in 2006 was 31.4% of sales, compared to 32.5% in 2005. The year over year change in gross profit is presented below (in millions): 2005 Gross Profit $ 228.1 Increase (Decrease) Sales Volume (10.0 ) Selling Price and Mix 3.4 Foreign Exchange Translation (4.3 ) Product Cost and Mix (12.8 ) 2006 Gross Profit $ 204.4 Average selling prices increased in 2006 primarily from shifts in product mix and price increases on selected products. Currency exchange rates have decreased our gross profit during 2006 compared to 2005. Our plants in Canada and Brazil were impacted by higher manufacturing costs resulting from translation to the weaker U.S. Dollar estimated at $3.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. These higher costs were partially offset by a modest increase in sales, estimated at $0.6 million, due to currency exchange rates. The increase related to product cost and mix, adjusted to exclude the effect of steel prices, increased by an estimated 2.5% and includes the effects of higher energy costs for utilities, annual wage increases to our employees and the effects of inflation on other cost elements. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in steel costs estimated at $1.3 million compared to the previous year. Total selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") was $111.2 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 17.1% in 2006 compared to 15.7% in 2005. One of the largest increases in 2006 was the $3.2 million increase in stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. We also instituted an increase in average salaries to our employees, resulting in a year over year increase estimated at $1.3 million. Depreciation expense increased $0.4 million, primarily due to additional investments in infrastructure and administrative systems. Advertising expenses increased by $0.4 million year over year. International operating expenses increased $0.5 million from the prior year due to the weaker U.S. Dollar and its effect on the translation of foreign expenses. These increases were largely offset by several decreases, incl uding a $1.4 million decrease in performance based compensation, a $1.6 million reduction for legal and compliance related professional services and adjustments to work force levels at several locations. In August, 2006, we announced a redesign of our U.S. retirement plans, including a freeze of our domestic defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2006, and an increase in funding under our defined contribution 401(k) plan. In conjunction with this redesign, we incurred a pension curtailment charge of $3.2 million, representing the unamortized prior service cost for plan participants, and an additional charge of $0.5 million for related fees and costs associated with the changes to our retirement plans. On August 8, 2006, we announced our plan to close one of the IPEG segments manufacturing plants, located in Menominee, Michigan. Production from this plant was shifted to other plants within our IPEG segment during the fourth quarter. We recognized a $1.2 million charge related to this plant closure during 2006. The related land and building is currently being marketed for sale. Income from continuing operations for 2006 was $38.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, in 2005. The change in income from continuing operations is due primarily to the following: &lt; The decrease in operating income of $29.5 million discussed above; and &lt; A provision of $16.3 million for income taxes, compared to a benefit $24.5 million in 2005, which reflected the reversal of most of a valuation allowance previously established on our U.S. deferred income tax assets. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.16 Interest expense of $35.8 million in 2006 compares to $37.3 million in 2005, and the decrease was largely due to lower average outstanding debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. The weighted average variable interest rate on our term loans increased by 42 basis points from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006. Interest income declined to $0.4 million for 2006 compared to $0.6 million in 2005, primarily due to a decline in average cash balances. Other income of $1.5 million in 2006 compared to $0.9 million of other expense in 2005. The $2.4 million difference was largely due to the 2005 $3.0 million write off of deferred financing costs resulting from prepayment of principal on our term debt. Excluding this expense, other income for both periods was primarily related to proceeds from insurance settlements. The 2006 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $16.3 million, or 30.0% of income before taxes. In 2005 we recorded an income tax benefit of $24.5 million. Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 54,416 $ 80,179 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 16,349 (24,528 ) Income from continuing operations $ 38,067 $ 104,707 Effective tax rate 30.0 % (30.6 %) The $40.9 million year over year change in income taxes is largely due to the 2005 reversal of most of the valuation allowance established on our U.S. deferred income tax assets. The valuation allowance was originally established in the third quarter of 2003. Our domestic net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a valuation allowance during 2005 until the reversal of the valuation allowance on December 31, 2005. Accordingly, we recognized minimal net federal domestic tax expense on our domestic income during 2005, except for incremental taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate our U.S. net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward is $16.2 million, and our state NOL carryforwards are $51.0 million. These NOL carryforwards are available to reduce cash taxes on future domestic taxable income, although a portion of the state NOL carryforwards are reduced by a valuation allowance reflecting the expectation that the carryforward period will expire before they can all be utilized. Income from discontinued operations of $4.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in 2006 compared to $1.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in 2005. These results consisted entirely of our discontinued Lawnmower segment. The Company operated the Lawnmower segment through July 26, 2006. Sales for the partial 2006 year were $29.5 million compared to $54.4 million in 2005. The 2006 income included $17.4 million of pretax gain on the disposal of net assets and a $5.3 million pretax loss from operations. The loss from operations was primarily due to expenses necessary to finalize the closure of the facility, including the termination of the majority of the Lawnmower segment employees, and to facilitate the transfer of assets sold to Husqvarna. These results included compensation, severance and benefits costs of $2.8 million, a charge to write down assets we retained (primarily the land and building) and other expenses. Income taxes for discontinued operations were $7.6 million. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 represents the after tax segment contribution. The net cash proceeds from the sale of the Lawnmower segment were approximately $32.4 million and were used to reduce outstanding debt. Segment Results. The following table reflects segment sales and operating income for 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 2006 as % of 2005 Sales: Outdoor Products $ 455,009 $ 452,334 101 % Industrial and Power Equipment 196,896 250,967 78 % Inter Segment Elimination (841 ) (1,045 ) 80 % Total sales $ 651,064 $ 702,256 93 % Operating income Outdoor Products $ 97,805 $ 105,536 93 % Industrial and Power Equipment 13,347 28,037 48 % Inter Segment Elimination 29 (14 ) 207 % Contribution from segments 111,181 133,559 83 % Corporate expense (17,950 ) (15,768 ) 114 % Retirement plan redesign (3,747 ) Plant closure costs (1,216 ) Operating income $ 88,268 $ 117,791 75 % BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.17 Outdoor Products Segment. Sales for the Outdoor Products segment increased $2.7 million, or 1%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Of this increase, $2.6 million was due to additional sales volume, coming primarily from an increase in sales of chainsaw guide bars and accessories outside the U.S. and from our ICS concrete cutting products and accessories. These increases were partially offset by a net unit sales decrease of cutting chain and other product categories. Price increases were realized in certain markets; however, the combination of selling prices and product mix resulted in a net decrease of $0.5 million compared to 2005. The net effect of foreign currency translation on sales was an increase of $0.6 million. Order backlog decreased to $54.8 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $82.5 million at December 31, 2005, a 34% decrease. The decrease in backlog compared to last year was partially due to increases in capacity and to improved delivery to customers, both of which have resulted in reduced order lead times. Sales of chainsaw guide bars increased 11%, which was made possible by increased production capacity and continued strong demand. Unit sales of chainsaw parts and accessories used for forestry or wood cutting applications increased a modest 1%. A decrease in chainsaw chain volume partially offset the gains in guide bars, parts and accessories. Sales of outdoor equipment parts, including lawnmower blades and other accessories for lawn and garden use, decreased 4%, largely due to adverse weather conditions in U.S. markets. Geographically, the weaker U.S. Dollar during 2006 provided incremental advantage for our selling prices, contributing to a 2% increase in international sales on top of 12% growth in 2005 and 20% growth in 2004. Sales to OEMs increased by 3%, while replacement sales were flat on a year over year basis. Sales of ICS products increased $2.8 million, with unit sales of replacement diamond chain increasing 9% and sa ws and saw packages increasing 4% compared to the prior year. Segment contribution to operating income decreased $7.7 million, or 7%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The favorable effect of increased sales volume on contribution was approximately $2.1 million. This increase was offset by the net unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, estimated at $4.7 million, driven primarily by the effect that stronger Canadian and Brazilian currencies had on our manufacturing costs and SG&A expenses. These higher costs were partially offset by the favorable net effect of a weaker U.S. Dollar on sales. Excluding the effects of currency exchange rates, the net unfavorable effect of cost and mix was $4.0 million. This includes inflationary pressures of higher wages and other conversion costs, partially offset by an estimated $1.5 million year over year reduction in steel costs, and $1.0 million related to reductions in staffing levels. The operating margin of 21.5% in 2006 compares to 23.3% in 2 005. Industrial and Power Equipment Segment. Sales for the Industrial and Power Equipment segment decreased $54.1 million, or 22%, in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a significant decline in the North American market for forestry equipment. A decline in the volume of timber harvesting equipment products sold resulted in a $62.7 million reduction in segment sales from 2005. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our gear related products, which achieved sales growth of $6.0 million, or 23%, compared to the prior year, most of which was attributed to increased volume. Segment sales also increased by $3.9 million due to increased selling price realization during the year across both groups of products. This segment is a cyclical, capital goods business with results closely linked to the performance of the North American forestry industry in general . During 2006, it is estimated that industry wide unit sales of North American forestry equipment were down by 23% as compared to 2005 for the markets served by our products. Amid this downturn in the forestry industry, we have continued to invest in new products and brand initiatives. Our product line includes 13 models that were newly introduced or updated during 2006. In June 2006, we acquired the assets of Votec Engineering AB ("Votec"), a European manufacturer of harvester heads for timber harvesting equipment. We have also made changes in our branding and trade dress. In February 2006, our agreements with Caterpillar Inc. were amended, and products previously offered under the "Timberking"&reg; brand were converted to the "Caterpillar"&reg; or "Cat"&reg; brand. Sales through the Caterpillar channel were $40.4 million in 2006. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2006, we consolidated three of our brand offerings (Hydro Ax, Prentice and Fabtek) into one (Prentice). The introduction of new products, the acquisition of Votec, and the re branding efforts are pa rt of the segments strategy to improve market share in established markets and gain incremental distribution outside of North America. Sales of IPEGs products outside of North America increased by $5.1 million, or 52%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Order backlog decreased to $18.5 million at December 31, 2006 from $45.0 million at December 31, 2005, reflecting softness in the North American forestry equipment market. Segment contribution to operating income decreased $14.7 million, or 52%, in 2006 compared to 2005, with $12.2 million of this decrease due to the lower sales volume. Increases in cost of goods sold and SG&A expense included annual increases in salaries and wages, a $1.1 million increase in product related expenses, a $0.5 million increase related to EPAmandated use of Tier III engines and other product design projects, and a $0.3 million increase for advertising expense, which included the cost of re branding of Timberking&reg; products to Caterpillar&reg; and Cat&reg;. The price of steel materials and BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.18 components stabilized in 2006 after significant increases in recent years and increased by only $0.3 million from 2005. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation, travel expenses, increases in average selling prices and an improved product mix. In August we announced the closure of one of the segments smaller manufacturing plants, located in Menominee, Michigan, and the manufacturing of affected products was moved to other plants during the fourth quarter. Costs related to the plant closure are reported separately and are not included as part of the segments results. The operating margin of 6.8% in 2006 compares to 11.2% in 2005. Corporate Expense. Corporate expense increased $2.2 million, or 14%, in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase includes a $3.2 million increase in stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Stock based compensation expense is expected to increase gradually over the next several years as a result of the effects of additional stock compensation grants. Future levels of stock based compensation expense will depend on many factors, including the quantity, type and vesting schedule of future grants, the price of our stock, the volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates. Salaries and performance related compensation increased $0.5 million. These increases are partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal and other compliance related costs. Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to year ended December 31, 2004 The table below provides a summary of results and primary factors contributing to the year over year change in operating results. ( Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2005 2004 Increase Contributing Factor Sales $ 702.3 $ 643.0 $ 59.3 $ 34.0 Sales volume 23.0 Price and mix 2.3 Foreign currency translation Operating income 117.8 111.3 6.5 8.7 Sales volume 3.2 Price, costs, mix, and expense (5.4 ) Foreign currency translation Income from continuing operations 104.7 4.5 100.2 6.5 Increase in operating income 22.3 Decrease in net interest expense 38.8 Decrease in other expense 32.6 Change in income tax provision Income from continuing operations per diluted share 2.20 0.12 2.08 Income from discontinued operations 1.9 1.7 0.2 Income from discontinued operations per diluted share 0.04 0.04 Net income 106.6 6.3 100.3 Net income per diluted share 2.24 0.16 2.08 These results reflect the following: &lt; On a consolidated basis, we experienced year over year increases in sales and operating income related to business growth. &lt; We continued to benefit from the refinancing activities completed during the second half of 2004, which lowered our interest expense. &lt; We recognized a favorable income tax benefit in 2005 to remove most of a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. Our sales in 2005 increased by $59.3 million, or 9%, from 2004. The following are highlights of the year over year comparison. &lt; International sales grew $44.8 million, or 16%, with each of our segments achieving their strongest percentage sales growth outside of the U.S. On a consolidated basis, U.S. year over year sales growth was 4%. &lt; In the Outdoor Products segment: 0 International sales grew $31.8 million, or 12%, with increases in Europe, Latin America and Asia, primarily in forestry related chainsaw parts and accessories; 0 The impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies of Canada, Europe and Brazil resulted in increased sales of $2.3 million due to the effects of foreign currency translation. The weaker U.S. Dollar also provided more competitive selling prices for our products, contributing to the additional volume; and BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.19 0 Growth among our concrete cutting products was 25%. This included increases in unit volume for our saws and replacement chain of 79% and 25%, respectively. &lt; In the Industrial and Power Equipment segment: 0 Sales outside North America grew $4.8 million, or 96%, reflecting gains in Australia, Brazil and Russia; 0 Continued expansion of the Timberking&reg; line of timber harvesting equipment, which generated $16.1 million worldwide in incremental sales through the Caterpillar distribution channel, helped to access new markets. Total sales of Timberking products in 2005 were $61.6 million; and 0 Higher average selling prices in our Industrial and Power Equipment segment contributed $12.5 million. This increase in average prices included increases in list prices and a reduction in competitive discounts. Consolidated order backlog at December 31, 2005 was $127.5 million, a decrease from $141.1 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily in the Industrial and Power Equipment segment. Operating income increased by $6.5 million, or 6%, from 2004 to 2005, while our operating margin for 2005 was 16.8% of sales compared to 17.3% for 2004. A comparison of the two periods reflects the following: &lt; Favorable effect of sales volume in both of our segments; &lt; The implementation of selling price increases in certain markets; &lt; Faster relative growth rates for IPEG segment with lower operating margins compared to our Outdoor Products segment with higher operating margins; &lt; The unfavorable effect of higher steel costs; and &lt; The unfavorable net effect of currency exchange rates, primarily due to a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to the Canadian Dollar and the Brazilian Real. The increase in operating income reflects a year over year increase in gross profit of $7.2 million. Our gross margin in 2005 was 32.5% of sales, compared to 34.4% in 2004. The year over year change in gross profit is presented below (in millions): 2004 Gross Profit $ 220.9 Increase (Decrease) Sales Volume 8.7 Selling Price and Mix 23.0 Foreign Exchange Translation (4.4 ) Product Cost and Mix (20.1 ) 2005 Gross Profit $ 228.1 While the net effect of volume and price was favorable across our businesses on a year over year basis, there were several unfavorable factors influencing our gross margins. The effect of mix within and between our businesses and distribution channels varies greatly; however, with the largest growth coming from our lower margin IPEG segment and lower margin distribution channels, the overall effect was to lower gross margin. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our gross profit during 2005 compared to 2004. While our international sales increased by approximately $2.3 million from the currency effect of a weaker U.S. Dollar, our product costs were negatively impacted by changes in currency. Our plants in Canada and Brazil were impacted by higher manufacturing costs resulting from the weaker U.S. Dollar estimated at $3.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. Higher steel prices had an estimated adverse effect of $12.3 million over the previous year. In addition, the annual salary increase to our employees was 3% during 2005. These increases are partially offset by productivity gains in our plants and by selling price increases. Total selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") of $110.3 million increased $0.7 million, or 1%, over the prior year. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 15.7% in 2005 compared to 17.0% in 2004, continuing a trend of improved leverage on existing selling and administrative capacity. One of the largest increases in 2005 was the $2.4 million increase in professional services expenses, which included $2.9 million of incremental expenses for compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. This increase was partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in legal expenses. Our international operating expenses increased $0.9 million compared to the prior year due to the weaker U.S. Dollar and its effect on the translation of foreign expenses. Other increases included $0.4 million for bad debts and $0.3 million for increases in R&D costs. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $1.3 million compared to 20 04. This net decrease included increases of 3% and 4% for base compensation and benefits expense, respectively, offset by decreases for performance related compensation expenses. Advertising expense was down $1.3 million and personnel related expense, primarily for travel, decreased by $0.3 million. Income from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $4.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2004. The change is due primarily to the following: &lt; An increase in operating income of $6.5 million; &lt; A decrease in net interest expense of $22.3 million, primarily due to the decreases in average outstanding debt balances and borrowing rates associated with changes in our capital structure implemented in August 2004 and the use of cash flow to reduce debt principal outstanding; &lt; A decrease in other expense of $38.8 million, due primarily to the $42.8 million charge taken in August 2004 associated with our refinancing transactions; and &lt; A benefit of $24.5 million for income taxes compared to an expense of $8.1 million in 2004, reflecting the 2005 reversal of most of a valuation allowance previously established on our U.S. deferred income tax assets. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.20 The reduction in interest expense was primarily due to the refinancing transactions that occurred in August 2004, which reduced our average borrowing rates and outstanding debt balances, as well as the significant subsequent reductions of debt during 2005. Total interest expense of $37.3 million in 2005 compares to $61.3 million in 2004, which included a $4.2 million non recurring charge for interest expense incurred during the required 30 day notice period involving the redemption of our public debt. The benefits gained from the refinancing and debt reduction were partially offset by an increase in interest rates. The weighted average variable interest rate on our term loans increased by 161 basis points from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Interest income declined $1.7 million to $0.6 million for 2005 compared to $2.3 million in 2004. 2004 interest income included $1.4 million related to an income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of that year. Other expense decreased $38.8 million due primarily to the charges taken in 2004 associated with our refinancing transactions. Net other expense in 2005 was $0.9 million and included $3.0 million to write off deferred financing costs resulting from the $83.4 million prepayment of debt principal during the year. In the fourth quarter of 2005 we also realized income of $2.3 million for a legal settlement. Net other expense in 2004 of $39.9 million included a $42.8 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2004 associated with our August refinancing transactions. This amount included $27.1 million for prepayment premiums, a $10.3 million write off of deferred financing costs related to the extinguishment of debt and $5.3 million to write off unamortized discount relating to the extinguished debt. In the fourth quarter of 2004 we realized income of $3.9 million related to a legal settlement for one of our segments. The 2005 income tax benefit of $24.5 million contrasts sharply to the 2004 income tax provision of $8.1 million. The $32.6 million year over year change is largely due to the reversal of most of the valuation allowance established on our U.S. deferred income tax assets on December 31, 2005. The valuation allowance was originally established in the third quarter of 2003 and was maintained until December 31, 2005. Accordingly, we recognized minimal net federal domestic tax expense on our domestic income during 2004 or 2005, except for incremental taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005. Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 Income before income taxes $ 80,179 $ 12,606 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (24,528 ) 8,058 Net income $ 104,707 $ 4,548 Effective tax rate (30.6 %) 63.9 % In the third quarter of 2003 we determined that it was more likely than not that all of our U.S. deferred tax assets would not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established against such deferred tax assets at that time. At the end of 2005, we determined that it was more likely than not that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized. This change in the estimated utilization of deferred tax assets reflected improvements in our profitability since the third quarter of 2003 stemming from business growth and reduced interest expense resulting from improvements in our capital structure. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"), included a one time election to deduct 85% of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated, as defined in the Act. Any repatriation of foreign earnings was required to be completed by December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated $24.9 million of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and recognized $2.0 million of related income taxes after allowable net operating loss offsets. Discontinued operations consisted entirely of our Lawnmower segment. The income from discontinued operations in 2005 was $1.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in 2004. Sales in our discontinued operations for 2005 of $54.4 million compare to $49.7 million in 2004. Segment Results. The following table reflects segment sales and operating income for 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2005 2004 2005 as % of 2004 Sales: Outdoor Products $ 452,334 $ 422,929 107 % Industrial and Power Equipment 250,967 221,028 114 % Inter Segment Elimination (1,045 ) (982 ) 106 % Total sales $ 702,256 $ 642,975 109 % Operating income Outdoor Products $ 105,536 $ 104,422 101 % Industrial and Power Equipment 28,037 21,456 131 % Inter Segment Elimination (14 ) (3 ) 467 % Contribution from segments 133,559 125,875 106 % Corporate expense (15,768 ) (14,558 ) 108 % Operating income $ 117,791 $ 111,317 106 % BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.21 Outdoor Products Segment. Sales for the Outdoor Products segment increased $29.4 million, or 7%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Of this increase, $19.6 million was due to additional sales volume, deriving primarily from forestry related chainsaw parts and accessories in international markets, and growth in our concrete cutting products and accessories. The combination of selling price increases and mix resulted in increased sales of $7.5 million. The effect of foreign currency translation on sales was an increase of $2.3 million. Order backlog increased to $82.5 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $77.4 million at December 31, 2004, a 7% increase. The increase in sales occurred across most product lines but was particularly strong for chainsaw parts and accessories used for forestry or wood cutting applications. Products related to concrete cutting, which experienced growth in all major markets, increased 79% in unit sales of saws and saw packages and 25% in unit sales of replacement diamond chain, for a net sales increase of $5.5 million. Sales of outdoor equipment parts, which includes lawnmower blades and other accessories for lawn and garden use, increased by a modest 1%, as adverse weather conditions in U.S. markets limited growth. Geographically, the weak U.S. Dollar during 2005 provided improved competitive selling prices, and demand continued to grow, resulting in a 12% increase in sales outside the U.S. on top of 2004s record results for sales outside the U.S. This growth was led by our chainsaw related products, with our largest increase in Europe, where there were good market conditions. In Latin America, increases were achieved in both OEM and replacement markets. Finally, export sales increased in the Far East, primarily due to improved economic conditions in Japan. Sales growth by channel was led by OEMs at 8%, while replacement sales had a 6% growth rate. Segment contribution to operating income increased $1.1 million, or 1%, in 2005 compared to 2004. The year over year change included a $1.4 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in SG&A expense. The favorable effect of increased volume was approximately $7.9 million. However, the net effect of foreign currency translation was unfavorable and estimated at $5.4 million. This net translation impact of currency is primarily from the effect stronger Canadian and Brazilian currencies had on our manufacturing costs in those countries, but also includes $0.9 million of higher SG&A expense worldwide, including our European operations as well. These cost increases are partially offset by the favorable effect a weaker U.S. Dollar had on sales in these same countries. Other cost pressures included increases in average steel prices, with a year over year adverse effect estimated at $6.9 million , higher energy prices, which added an estimated $0.8 million in cost to operate our plants and increases in capacity, which have supported business growth but have also added to our fixed costs. In addition, we incurred a loss of $0.9 million for the first year of start up operations in our new plant in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. These increases have been partially offset by increases in selling prices, productivity and a $0.6 million net decrease in SG&A expense after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation. Decreases in SG&A expense included a $1.4 million reduction in advertising expense, after a significant increase in 2004 for targeted brand awareness programs, and a $1.3 million reduction in performance compensation, after higher than normal expense in 2004. Increases in SG&A expense included $1.1 million for normal increases in salaries and benefits, and $0.6 million in bad debt expense. The operating margin of 23.3% in 2005 compares to 24.7% in 2004. Industrial and Power Equipment Segment. Sales for the Industrial and Power Equipment segment increased $29.9 million, or 14%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Just over half of this growth, $15.5 million, is due to favorable selling price and mix, with the realization of price increases estimated at $12.5 million across all product lines, through a combination of list price increases and a reduction of cash discounts. The favorable effect of higher volume was $14.4 million, with the largest growth seen among tracked feller bunchers. We also experienced strong growth in sales of loaders, partially due to the amount of felled timber from hurricanes, and increases among forwarders and harvesters. These increases are somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of our four wheel feller bunchers used for drive to tree harvesting. This decrease in drive to tree feller b unchers is attributed to dealer inventory corrections and a slight decline in our market share. This increase in sales was distributed geographically across domestic and international markets, with the international sales increasing by $12.9 million, or 55%, over the previous year. The increase in international sales included a sizable increase in Canada, part of our traditional North American market; however, growth of international sales outside of Canada also increased by $4.8 million, or 102%, over the previous year, largely through increases in Australia, Brazil and Russia. Order backlog decreased to $45.0 million at December 31, 2005 from $63.7 million at December 31, 2004, due in part to improvements in production bottlenecks that had adversely affected our product deliveries in the prior year. This segment is a cyclical, capital goods business with results closely linked to the performance of the forestry industry in general, particularly in our largest market, the Southeastern U.S. During 2005, the growth rate for the North American markets we serve, measured in units sold, was flat compared to 2004 for most of our products types. Sales of our gear related products grew $4.0 million, or 18%, during the year and contributed to these results with improved price realization and increased unit volume. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.22 Segment contribution to operating income increased $6.6 million, or 31%, in 2005 compared to 2004. Gross profit increased by approximately $5.8 million, and reductions in SG&A expense contributed an additional $0.8 million to the year over year improvement. The positive effect on gross profit from higher volume was limited to $0.8 million, due to a shift in product mix away from segment manufactured products towards Caterpillar manufactured products for which we receive a lower margin on sale. Cost increases included normal annual increases in wages and benefits, but also higher steel prices with an adverse effect estimated at $5.4 million compared to 2004s average steel prices. This shift in mix and cost increases have been largely offset by realization of price increases implemented early in 2005 and decreases in SG&A spending. SG&A decreases included a $0.8 million decrease in benefits, of which $0.6 million repr esented lower workers compensation expense, and a $0.4 million decrease in depreciation. These decreases are partially offset by increases in engineering related expense toward compliance with new Tier III engine requirements for our heavy equipment. The operating margin of 11.2% in 2005 compared to 9.7% in 2004. Corporate Expense. Corporate expense increased $1.2 million, or 8%, in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase included $2.9 million of additional professional services related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance requirements. Salaries and benefits increased $1.6 million. In addition to normal annual increases in salaries and benefits, the increase also reflects the addition of certain professional positions to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, including Sarbanes Oxley compliance. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million for legal expenses and a $1.4 million decrease for performance related compensation expenses. Higher costs to comply with Sarbanes Oxley requirements are expected t o continue for the foreseeable future, although at a level lower than the 2005 implementation year costs. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our 1999 merger and recapitalization transactions, we have carried significant amounts of debt. During the last three years we have initiated several actions to reduce our debt and related interest expense. In 2004, we executed a series of transactions, resulting in a reduction of debt and the average interest rates on that debt, as well as an increase in outstanding common stock. In 2005 and 2006, we made reductions in our debt using cash flow from operations and the net proceeds from the sale of our Dixon business. 2004 Refinancing Transactions. On August 9, 2004, we executed a series of significant refinancing transactions. These transactions, referred to as the "2004 Refinancing Transactions", included: &lt; The issuance of 13,800,000 shares of common stock, which generated net proceeds to the Company of $127.2 million; &lt; The issuance of new 87/8% senior subordinated notes due in 2012, which generated net proceeds to the Company of $167.1 million; &lt; The amendment and restatement of our existing senior credit facilities which included, among other things, an increase in amounts available, with the total amounts drawn increasing by $246.6 million, and a reduction in interest rates, revisions to financial covenant ratios and revision of certain repayment terms. We used the net proceeds of the 2004 Refinancing Transactions as follows: &lt; The redemption of our 7% senior notes with $150.0 million principal outstanding; &lt; The redemption of our 13% senior subordinated notes with $323.2 million principal outstanding; &lt; The repayment of our 12% convertible preferred equivalent security principal and accrued interest in the aggregate amount of $29.6 million; and &lt; The payment of related redemption premiums of $27.1 million. 2004 Amendment to Credit Facilities. On December 1, 2004, we amended our senior credit facilities to provide, among other things, for the repayment and elimination of the $50.0 million second collateral institutional loan established in August 2004 with the proceeds from a loan made possible by an increase in the term B loan limit. Also, adjustments to certain financial covenants were made and a lower borrowing rate was established. 2006 Amendment to Credit Facilities. On March 23, 2006, we amended certain terms of our senior credit facilities. This amendment included the following changes in the term notes and revolving credit facility: &lt; Maximum availability under the revolving credit facility was increased from $100.0 million to $150.0 million. &lt; Interest rates were reduced by 0.75% for the term B loan and 1.00% for the revolving credit facility. &lt; Certain financial covenants were modified, including increases to the amounts that may be expended for acquisitions, dividends and purchase of our stock, as well as modifications to certain financial ratio requirements. &lt; We incurred fees and third party costs of $0.7 million related to the amendment. Immediately following the amendment, we completed the following transactions: &lt; $82.1 million was borrowed under the revolving credit facility. &lt; The total principal balance of $4.6 million was paid off on our Canadian term B loan, and that loan was canceled. &lt; $77.5 million in principal was paid against the term B loan, leaving a balance of $150.0 million outstanding. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.23 Since 2004, interest and principal payment obligations have been reduced as a result of these changes to our capital structure and credit agreements. Interest expense has been reduced by a reduction in our average borrowing rate and by the reduction in the principal amount of long term debt. The effects of these reductions have been partially offset by an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt. The variable interest rates increased by a net amount of 42 basis points in 2006 after increasing by 161 basis points during 2005. Our annual interest expense may continue to vary in the future because the senior credit facility interest rates are benchmarked against LIBOR. Our weighted average interest rate on all outstanding debt has increased from 7.63% as of December 31, 2005 to 7.99% as of December 31, 2006. Cash interest paid in 2006 was $33.0 million compared to $31.3 million in 2005. Cash interest paid in 2004 was $6 2.2 million, excluding net cash interest paid to redeem public debt. Total debt at December 31, 2006 was $350.9 million compared with total debt at December 31, 2005 of $407.7 million, a reduction of $56.8 million. Outstanding debt as of December 31, 2006 consisted of a term loan balance of $148.9 million, a revolving credit facility balance of $27.0 million and 87/8% senior subordinated notes of $175.0 million. Under the senior credit agreement, the amount available to be drawn on our $150.0 million revolving credit facility could be restricted by our leverage ratio and first lien credit facilities leverage ratio. Availability is further reduced for any outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had borrowing availability of $117.5 million and $94.1 million, respectively. We make voluntary prepayments of the term loan from time to time. In 2006, we made no such prepayments other than those associated with the March amendment. Once repaid, the term loan principal cannot be re borrowed under the terms of the senior credit facility. The Company and all of its domestic subsidiaries other than Blount, Inc. guarantee the obligations of Blount, Inc. under the senior credit facilities. The obligations under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Blount, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a pledge of all of Blount, Inc.s capital stock held by Blount International, Inc. and pledges of all of the stock of domestic subsidiaries held by Blount, Inc. In addition, Blount, Inc. has pledged 65% of the stock of its non domestic subsidiaries as additional collateral. Our senior credit facilities are subject to certain reporting and financial covenant compliance requirements. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2006. Non compliance with these covenants could result in severe limitations to our overall liquidity, and the term loan lenders could require actions for immediate repayment of outstanding amounts, potentially requiring sale of our assets. Our debt is not subject to any triggers that would require early payment of debt due to any adverse change in our credit rating. The revolving credit facility expires on August 9, 2009 and the term B loan facility expires on August 9, 2010. Required principal payments on the term loan are adjusted after any voluntary prepayment of principal we make on the term loan. As of December 31, 2006, the term B loan facility requires quarterly payments of $0.4 million, with a final payment of $143.3 million due on the maturity date. The Company has one registered debt security, the 87/8% senior subordinated notes. The 87/8% senior subordinated notes are due in full on August 1, 2012. These notes were issued by Blount, Inc., are fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guaranteed by the Company and all of its domestic subsidiaries ("guaranto r subsidiaries") other than Blount, Inc. All guarantor subsidiaries of these 87/8% senior subordinated notes are 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. While the Company and all of its domestic subsidiaries guarantee these 87/8% senior subordinated notes, none of Blounts existing foreign subsidiaries ("non guarantor subsidiaries") guarantee these notes. Our debt continues to be significant, and future debt service payments continue to represent substantial obligations. This degree of leverage may adversely affect our operations and could have important consequences. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, "Substantial Leverage" for further discussion. Over the longer term, we expect to meet our financial and capital needs, including payment of debt obligations, through a combination of cash flow from operations and amounts available under existing credit facilities, as well as the potential issuance of new debt, sale of additional shares of stock or establishment of new credit facilities. While there can be no assurance, management believes we will comply with all financial performance covenants during the next twelve months. Should we not comply with the covenants, additional significant actions will be required. These actions may include, among others, an attempt to renegotiate our debt f acilities, sales of assets, restructuring and reductions in capital expenditures. We intend to fund working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months through expected cash flows generated from operations and the amounts available under our revolving credit agreement. Interest on our debt is payable in arrears according to varying interest rates and periods. We expect our remaining resources will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance, however, that these resources will be sufficient to meet our needs. We may BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.24 also consider other options available to us in connection with future liquidity needs. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 were $27.6 million compared to $12.9 million at December 31, 2005. Cash provided by operating activities is summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Income from continuing operations $ 38,067 $ 104,707 $ 4,548 Non cash items included in net income 39,538 (13,841 ) 71,124 Subtotal 77,605 90,866 75,672 Changes in assets and liabilities, net (13,014 ) (29,306 ) (4,722 ) Discontinued operations (4,575 ) 3,552 4,844 Cash provided by operating activities $ 60,016 $ 65,112 $ 75,794 Non cash items consist of expense for the early extinguishment of debt, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization and other non cash charges, deferred income taxes and (gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment. Changes in assets and liabilities, net, consists of those changes in assets and liabilities included in the cash flows from operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2006 cash provided by operating activities of $60.0 million reflected the following significant items: &lt; Income from continuing operations of $38.1 million; &lt; Addition of non cash items of $39.5 million, which included the following: 0 Depreciation expense of $17.2 million; 0 Other non cash expenses include amortization of deferred financing costs of $3.7 million, stock compensation costs of $3.3 million related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), a nonrecurring pension curtailment charge of $3.2 million related to the redesign of our U.S. retirement plans and a net gain of $1.0 million related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; 0 A deferred income tax provision of $13.0 million. &lt; Changes in assets and liabilities used $13.0 million of net cash, including the following items: 0 Decreases in accounts receivable of $8.3 million and inventory of $1.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. These decreases are in part due to lower revenues and associated business activities during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005; 0 Reduction in accrued expenses of $5.5 million, primarily related to accrued income taxes payable; 0 Pension funding of $11.0 million in excess of the amount charged to expense. &lt; Discontinued operations used $4.6 million, primarily for cost to close the Dixon manufacturing facility and the associated payment of transitional costs and severance to employees. 2005 cash provided by operating activities of $65.1 million, reflected the following significant items: &lt; Net income from continuing operations of $104.7 million. &lt; Reduction for non cash items of $13.8 million, which included the following: 0 A deferred income tax benefit of $35.3 million, primarily due to the reversal of most of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred income tax assets; 0 Depreciation expense of $15.3 million and amortization of deferred financing costs of $3.5 million; and 0 A non cash charge of $3.0 million for the early extinguishment of debt. &lt; Changes in assets and liabilities used $29.3 million of net cash, including the following items: 0 An increase in accounts receivable of $17.6 million and inventories of $5.6 million, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable. The increase in these working capital components was partially due to an increase in sales in late 2005 and anticipation of increased sales for the first half of 2006. Additionally, the increase in accounts receivable was partially due to a delay in collections from certain of our larger OEM customers at the end of 2005. These OEM customer receivables were collected in 2006. 0 Pension plan funding of $1.8 million in excess of the amount charged to expense. &lt; Discontinued operations provided $3.6 million, representing the Lawnmower segments cash flows from operations. 2004 cash provided by operating activities of $75.8 million reflected the following significant items: &lt; Income from continuing operations of $4.5 million; &lt; Addition for non cash items of $71.1 million, which included the following: 0 A charge of $47.0 million related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the 2004 Refinancing Transactions; 0 Depreciation of $14.7 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $4.4 million and amortization of debt discounts and other non cash interest of $2.4 million; BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.25 &lt; Changes in assets and liabilities used $4.7 million of net cash, including the following items: 0 Collection of $25.2 million for a refund of income taxes and related interest; 0 The effect of increased sales activity resulted in use of cash for additional accounts receivable of $11.6 million and inventories of $10.7 million, partially offset by an $8.6 million increase in accounts payable; 0 Pension plan funding of $5.7 million in excess of amounts charged to expense; and 0 Discontinued operations provided $4.8 million representing the Lawnmower segments cash flows from operations. We maintain defined benefit pension plans for substantially all employees and retirees in the U.S., Canada and Belgium. In addition, we maintain post retirement medical and other benefit plans covering most of our employees and retirees in the U.S. Accounting effects and funding requirements for these plans are subject to actuarial estimates, actual plan experience and the assumptions we make regarding future trends and expectations. See further discussion below of these key assumptions and estimates under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates". Total expense recognized for these pension and other postretirement plans, excluding a curtailment charge for the U.S. pension plan, was $10.7 million, $12.8 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, we recognized $3.2 million of pension curtailment expense in 2006 to reflect the freezing of our U.S. defined benefit p ension plan effective December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we also have $45.4 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses that will be amortized to expense over future years, including $2.1 million to be expensed in 2007. Cash contributions for all pension and post retirement benefit plans were $20.8 million for 2006, $12.4 million for 2005 and $16.6 million for 2004. Funding requirements for post retirement benefit plans fluctuate significantly from year to year. See further discussion following under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates." The Company intends to make contributions to our funded pension plans in 2007 of approximately $11.0 million to $15.0 million. The obligations under our other post retirement benefit plans are made on a pay as you go basis. We also make cash contributions to our U.S. 401(k) plan. In 2006, we contributed $2.7 million, and expect to contribute between $2.5 million and $3.0 million in 2007. In 2008, we expect contributions to this plan will increase by approximately $2.8 million to $3.3 million from the additional contribution implemented as part of our U.S. retirement plan restructuring undertaken in 2006 . At December 31, 2006, as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 "Employers Accounting for defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans" ("SFAS No. 158"), all previously unrecognized actuarial losses have now been recognized (see Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"), signed into law October 22, 2004, included a one time election to deduct 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the Act. Any repatriation of foreign earnings was required to be completed by December 31, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005 we repatriated $24.9 million of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Managements intention is to reinvest remaining undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely. Net cash income tax payments were $9.9 million in 2006, $14.3 million in 2005 and $9.3 million in 2004, excluding a $21.6 million multi year refund received in the fourth quarter of 2004. Income tax payments during these years have been primarily the result of our foreign tax liability, with a portion also for state and local taxes and alternative minimum tax. In addition, incremental cash taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings of $1.4 million were paid in 2005. In the past three years U.S. taxable income has been offset by our domestic net operating loss carryforwards. We expect to continue offsetting domestic profits during the first half of 2007, and then expect to begin paying cash income taxes in the U.S. in the second half of 2007. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate our U.S. NOL carryforward is $16.2 million and our state NOL carryforwards are $51.0 million. These carryforwards expire at various dates from 2007 through 2024. Additionally, we have a foreign tax credit carryforward of approximately $1.7 million that expires in 2010 and 2011. We also have state and federal research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.5 million that expire at various dates from 2007 through 2025, and an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately $1.2 million, which may be carried forward indefinitely under current tax law. Cash used by investing activities is summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment $ 1,631 $ 977 $ 171 Acquisition of business (503 ) Purchases of property, plant and equipment (22,959 ) (19,338 ) (21,136 ) Discontinued operations 32,322 (586 ) (574 ) Cash used by investing activities $ 10,491 $ (18,947 ) $ (21,539 ) In 2006 we generated $10.5 million from investing activities inclusive of $32.3 million of net activity from discontinued operations that was primarily composed of net BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.26 proceeds from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our former Lawnmower segment. We also made an investment of $0.5 million for the acquisition of Votec, an international manufacturer of harvesting heads. Purchases of property, plant and equipment for all three years presented are primarily for productivity improvements and expanded manufacturing capacity. In the three year period we have invested $14.4 million for construction and equipment at our facility in China, with $6.5 million of the total expended in 2006. In 2007, we expect to utilize $22.0 million to $27.0 million in available cash for capital expenditures, primarily for ongoing productivity and cost improvements in our manufacturing processes and routine replacement of machinery and equipment, including tooling that is consumed in the production process, as well as incremental capacity expansion. Cash provided by financing activities is summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Net reduction of debt $ (56,848 ) $ (86,488 ) $ (124,035 ) Issuance, modification and redemption costs (700 ) (3,979 ) (56,526 ) Proceeds from issuance of common stock 138,000 Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 1,740 8,669 1,682 Cash used by financing activities $ (55,808 ) $ (81,798 ) $ (40,879 ) The 2006 activity included the following: &lt; Net debt reduction of $56.8 million, partially funded with $32.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Lawnmower segment. &lt; Expenditures of $0.7 million incurred with the March, 2006 amendment to our senior credit facilities; &lt; $1.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a related $0.7 million tax benefit that is recognized as a financing activity under SFAS No. 123(R). 2005 activity included the following: &lt; Net debt reduction of $86.5 million, including $83.0 million of voluntary prepayments of principal and $3.5 million of scheduled and required payments on our term loans. &lt; Payment of previously recorded debt issuance costs of $2.6 million, and previously recorded stock issuance costs of $1.4 million, related to the 2004 Refinancing Transactions; &lt; Proceeds from the issuance of stock which were in turn used for the purchase of treasury stock, each at $6.1 million and netting to zero; and &lt; Proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants of $8.7 million. In June 2005, we and certain of our shareholders sold 7.5 million shares of our common stock in a public offering. We received cumulative net proceeds of $10 thousand for the following transactions: &lt; Lehman Brothers sold 6,117,620 shares of our common stock, and its ownership as of September 30, 2005 was approximately 8.9 million shares, or approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from this sale; &lt; We issued 382,380 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $6.1 million; &lt; We purchased 382,380 shares of common stock from certain stockholders for $6.1 million. These shares are held as treasury stock and we have accounted for this treasury stock as constructively retired in the consolidated financial statements; and &lt; Warrants for 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 a share were exercised with net proceeds of $10 thousand received by the Company. Of the amounts disbursed for debt and equity issuance costs in 2005, $3.2 million was paid to Lehman Brothers, which previously controlled more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. 2004 activity included the following (see also preceding discussion regarding the 2004 Financing Transactions): &lt; Issuance of $435.5 million of new debt. &lt; Debt reduction of $559.5 million that included: extinguishment of $526.4 million of debt, scheduled principal payments of $5.2 million, an excess cash flow payment of $2.4 million and an additional voluntary reduction of $25.5 million. &lt; Debt issuance costs of $16.0 million. &lt; Cash fees, premiums and expenses related to the debt extinguishment of $31.2 million. &lt; Gross proceeds of $138.0 million from the issuance of 13.8 million shares of common stock at $10.00 per share. The Company also paid $9.4 million in fees and expenses associated with the issuance of these shares. &lt; Stock options exercised provided additional capital of $1.7 million. Certain customers of the discontinued operations financed their purchases through third party financing companies. Under the terms of these financing arrangements, the Company may be required to repurchase certain equipment from the finance companies, or reimburse them for any financial loss incurred, should a customer default on payment. The aggregate repurchase or reimbursement obligation outstanding under the agreements as of December 31, 2006 was $2.1 million. These arrangements have not had a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results or cash flows in the past. The Company does not expect to incur any material charges related to these agreements in future periods based on past experience and because any repurchased equipment would most likely be resold for approximately the same value. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.27 As of December 31, 2006, our contractual and estimated obligations are as follows (in thousands): (Amounts in thousands) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Debt obligations (1) $ 350,875 $ 1,500 $ 30,000 $ 144,375 $ 175,000 Estimated interest payments (2) 139,824 28,565 56,273 39,455 15,531 Purchase commitments (3) 125 125 Operating lease obligations (4) 8,804 1,630 2,339 1,904 2,931 Defined benefit pension obligations (5) 13,072 10,972 2,100 Other post retirement obligations (6) 17,450 1,680 2,887 2,161 10,722 Other long term liabilities (7) 450 25 425 Total contractual obligations $ 530,600 $ 44,497 $ 94,024 $ 187,895 $ 204,184 (1) Scheduled minimum principal payments on debt.

(2) Estimated future interest payments based on existing debt balances, timing of scheduled minimum principal payments and estimated variable interest rates. (3) Does not include amounts recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet. (4) See also Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Current minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans. Does not include estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans of approximately $5.7 million in 2008 and $7.8 million each year thereafter. Actual funding requirements may vary significantly from these estimates based on actual return on assets, changes in assumptions, plan modifications and actuarial gains and losses. See additional discussion of these key assumptions and estimates under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" below. Additional voluntary funding payments may also be made. (6) Estimated payments for various non qualified retirement benefits. The Company also has benefit payment obligations due under its post retirement medical plan that are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go, and are not included herein. See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. (7) Advisory and consulting fees for certain current and former officers and directors of the Company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." We do not have any variable interest entities or off balance sheet arrangements as defined by this pronouncement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity components, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We record reductions to selling prices as products are shipped. These reductions are based on competitive and market conditions, in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances. These reductions are estimated and recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to the invoice total or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date. The amount accrued may increase or decrease prior to payment due to customer performance and market conditions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses against our recorded accounts receivable. Such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customers financial statements and conditions through monitoring services. Based on these reviews, additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period. Specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of our business units. We adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels. We estimate the required inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis. We maintain such reserves until a product is sold or market conditions require a change in the reserves. We perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. We also perform an impairment analysis of goodwill whenever circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. The impairment tests are performed by determining the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted projected cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values of the reporting units, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Events or changes in circumstances may occur that could create underperformance relative to projected future cash flows, which could create future impairments. BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.28 We offer certain warranties with the sale of our products. The warranty obligation is recorded at the point of revenue recognition as a charge to cost of goods sold and as a liability on the balance sheet, and is estimated based upon historic customer claims, supplier performance and new product reliability analysis. Should a change in trend occur in customer claims, an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary. We incur expenses in connection with product liability claims as a result of alleged product malfunctions or defects. We maintain insurance for a portion of this exposure and record a liability for our non insured obligations. We estimate our product liability obligations on a case by case basis, in addition to a review of product performance trends. These estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available or performance trends change. On January 1, 2006, we implemented SFAS No. 123 (R) under the modified prospective approach. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in a reduction in income before taxes of $3.3 million, and a reduction in income from continuing operations and net income of $2.1 million, in 2006. We expect to continue to incur significant stock compensation expense in future periods. Prior to 2006, we accounted for stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123 and provided pro forma disclosure, but did not expense the majority of our stock based compensation. Under the modified prospective application method, the results for prior periods have not been restated. None of our outstanding stock awards were modified in anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R). As of December 31, 2006, the total compensation cost related to awards not yet recognized was $1.9 million. The weighted average period over which this expense is expected to be recogn ized is one year. We determine the fair value of stock based awards using the Black Scholes model. Assumptions for estimated lives of stock options and SARs, the risk free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield are based on historical information and management estimates. We determine our post retirement obligations on an actuarial basis that requires management to make certain assumptions. These assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate to be used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation and the anticipated trend in health care costs. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and consideration is given to market conditions, as well as to the requirements of SFAS No. 158. The weighted average assumed rate of return on plan assets was 8.9% for 2006, and we anticipate using a rate of 8.5% in 2007. We believe this assumed rate of return is reasonable, given the asset composition and long term historic trends. A weighted average discount rate assumption of 5.7% was used to determine our plan liabilities at December 31, 2006. We believe this discount rate is reasonable, given comparable rates for high quality corporate bonds with terms comparabl e to the projected cash flows for our respective plans. We have assumed that health care costs will increase by 8% in 2007, 7% in 2008, 6% in 2009 and 5% in 2010 and thereafter. Our annual post retirement expenses can be impacted by changes in these assumptions. A 1% change in the return on assets assumption would change annual pension expense by $1.5 million in 2007. A 1% decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by $2.7 million in 2007, and a 1% increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by $1.8 million in 2007. A 1% increase in the health care cost trend assumption for 2007 and beyond would increase annual post retirement medical costs by approximately $0.5 million per year and a 1% decrease in the health care cost trend assumption for 2007 and beyond would decrease annual post retirement medical costs by approximately $0.4 million a year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Included in recorded tax liabilities are estimated amounts related to uncertain tax positions. Actual tax liabilities may differ materially from these estimates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2006, we have a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $2.7 million, pr imarily related to state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN No. 48"). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective January 1, 2007. We are currently in the process of obtaining and analyzing information about our uncertain tax positions from our domestic and BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.29 international subsidiaries in order to determine the impact of adopting FIN No. 48 as of the beginning of 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. We adopted SAB 108 in September 2006 with no effect on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for us on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS No. 159. Related Party Transactions In March 2005, we paid $3.2 million to Lehman Brothers, which previously controlled more than 50% of our outstanding common stock, for previously accrued advisory fees relating to the 2004 Refinancing Transactions. In May 2005, Lehman Brothers paid $0.3 million for previously accrued costs we incurred in conjunction with the secondary public offering that occurred in December 2004. In June 2005, as part of a secondary stock offering, we incurred $0.1 million in expenses which were reimbursed by Lehman Brothers in October 2005. Forward Looking Statements "Forward looking statements," as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, used in this report, including without limitation our "outlook," "guidance," expectations," "beliefs," "plans," "indications," "estimates," "anticipations," and their variants, are based upon available information and upon assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable; however, these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in Item 1A, "Risk Factors", and should not be considered indicative of actual results that the Company may achieve in the future. Specifically, issues concerning foreign currency exchange rates, the cost to the Company of commodities in general, and of steel in particular, the anticipated level of applicable interest rates, tax rates, discount rates and rates of return and the anticipated effects of discontinued operations involve estimates and assumptio ns. To the extent that these, or any other such assumptions, are not realized going forward, or other unforeseen factors arise, actual results for the periods subsequent to the date of this report may differ materially. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivatives. When utilized, derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes. See Interest Rate Risk and Commodity Price Risk below for discussion of our expectations regarding future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives. Interest Rate Risk. We manage our ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. Historically, we have, on occasion, entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and we have entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt outstanding by $6.4 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates on our variable rate long term debt for the duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately $1.1 million in 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. Approximately 40% of the Outdoor Products segments sales and 64% of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in 2006. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of the Outdoor Products segments reported sales and operating income. Historically, our principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in Canada and Brazil, and local currency sales and expenses in Europe. During the past three years, we have not used derivatives to manage any foreign currency exchange risk and, at December 31, 2006, no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding. The table below illustrates the estimated effect of a hypothetical BLOUNT INTERNATIONAL, INC.30 immediate 10% change in major currencies (defined for us as the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Brazilian Real): Effect of 10% Weaker U.S. Dollar (Amounts in thousands) Sales Cost of Sales Operating Income Euro $ 5,189 $ (1,518 ) $ 2,003 Canadian Dollar 1,629 (6,123 ) (4,983 ) Brazilian Real (2,050 ) (2,418 ) Commodity Price Risk. We secure raw materials through purchasing functions at each of our operating divisions. These functions are staffed by professionals who determine the sourcing of materials by assessing quality, availability, price and service of potential vendors. When possible, multiple vendors are utilized to ensure competitive prices and to minimize risk of lack of availability of materials. Some of these raw materials are subject to price volatility over time. We have not hedged against the price volatility of any raw materials within our operating segments by using any derivative instruments during 2006, 2005 or 2004. We purchased approximately $78 million of steel in 2006, our largest sourced commodity. A hypothetical immediate 10% change in the price of steel would have had an estimated $7.8 million effect on pre tax income in 2006. We utilize multiple suppliers to purchase steel. Raw material price volatility has not had a significant impact on our results in recent years, with the exception of steel pricing, where prices rose sharply in 2004 and 2005 and then declined somewhat in 2006. We estimate the impact of price changes on our cost of purchased steel to be a decrease of $1.3 million from 2005 to 2006, following an increase of $12.3 million from 2004 to 2005. Partially to offset the net cost increase, some selling prices to our customers have been increased. We source many of our outdoor care products from Asia through brokers and we anticipate expanding this practice in our other divisions. For example, we believe that we can source certain components both for timber harvesting equipment and gear related products at a lower cost from international locations. Historically, we have not incurred any significant issues in sourcing internationally, in part due to the fact that there are multiple suppliers for the products we purchase.
