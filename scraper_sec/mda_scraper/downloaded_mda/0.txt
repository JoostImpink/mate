These results reflect the continuing increase in global market penetration in the cable television and telecommunications markets, the improvement in servicing the worldwide information processing industries and increased volume in domestic and European component customer requirements. Such increases were offset by a significant decrease in domestic automotive wiring sales due to reduction in demand for certain vehicle platforms. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately one percent. The sales improvement in 1994 over 1993 was a result of the Companys increased participation in the fast growing U.S. cable television and telecommunications markets, the strength of the U.S. automotive industry and the improvement in the European market. International sales were $135 million, $109 million and $89 million for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Interconnection Products Business experienced sales growth in 1995 due to improved domestic and European markets along with the acquisition of Elastomeric Technologies Inc. The modest sales growth for the three years ended 1995 resulted from increases in new product sales offset by reduction in sales of mature product lines, price reductions and the de emphasizing of certain product lines. During these periods, this business has reorganized and reengineered its domestic and international operations in order to be a more efficient and competitive player in the markets it serves. As part of the restructuring announced by the Company in December 1995, this business will be exiting from certain low margin, commodity product lines and closing a plant. The Company will also be transferring certain product line production within Company facilities. These actions will allow the business to operate with a more focused product line strategy, concentrating on areas that have strong market share positions. The Wiring Systems and Components Business had a difficult sales year in 1995. Wiring sales, which management expected to decline in 1995 decreased by 30% due to the lower production run rates for both the Ford Aerostar and Mustang car platforms. Overall this business sales were down by only 15% as the growth in both domestic and European automotive component markets partially offset the weak wiring sales. In 1994, this business had significant sales growth with domestic sales increasing 34% and European sales increasing 41%. In addition, in 1994 this business benefitted from the strong domestic automotive market demand which included Fords Mustang and Aerostar vehicles. The Communications Products Business continued its stellar performance as sales increased over 30% in 1995 with market penetration in key geographical areas. This business serves two primary markets, cable television (CATV) and telecommunications which are building and upgrading their systems to accommodate new technologies and services. The Company has invested approximately $16 million and $11 million in this business for the last two years in new plant and equipment in response to the significant sales growth. The Company is projecting to invest approximately $18 million in capital expenditures for this business in 1996 to accommodate the anticipated customer demand. This capital commitment reflects the Companys strategy to grow this business to be 50% of the total Company sales. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately the same for the last two years. The sales mix has changed year over year with the significant increase in higher margin communications products offset by sales increases in mature, low margin products and underabsorption of overheads due to automotive volume 12 15 shortfalls. In addition, gross margin was affected by selective price decreases which were offset by increases in new product offerings (approximately $185 million and $138 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively). Management intends to maintain selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the 13% to 15% range of sales. During 1995, the Company invested in future oriented SG&A expenditures for the Communications Products Business. In addition, SG&A in 1995 included charges for estimated environmental cleanup costs amounting to $1.8 million for one facility which will be closed in connection with the Companys restructuring plan. In 1994, the Company recorded a portion of the Aegis litigation settlement proceeds (approximately $2 million) as a credit to SG&A as such amounts represented a recovery of litigation costs charged to SG&A in 1994 and prior periods. In December 1995, the Company announced plans to restructure its Interconnection Products Business and Wiring Systems and Components Business. This $18.7 million restructuring charge represented the costs to close certain manufacturing operations in its Interconnection Products and Wiring Systems Businesses, as well as the costs associated with exiting several low margin, commodity interconnect product lines. The cash requirements associated with the restructuring will be paid over the next two years, and are expected to be less than $4 million after taxes. The restructuring charge includes $9.3 million related to redundant or excess facilities and equipment costs which are being closed or abandoned. Operating expenses related to such facilities and equipment up to the time of closure or abandonment were not included in the restructuring charge. Additionally, $5.5 million of the restructuring charge related to employee severance costs for approximately 800 employees who will be terminated. The charge does not include salaries and wages to be paid to such employees up to their termination date. The remaining $3.9 million of the restructuring charge related to products which have been eliminated from the Companys product lines. The Company expects the savings from this restructuring plan will be approximately $7 million per year, however, such savings cannot be assured. Other income (expense) has remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales for the three years ended 1995. In 1995, other income (expense) included the write down of assets held for sale and facility costs amounting to $1 million. In 1994, other income (expense) included the write down of assets held for sale and lease termination costs of approximately $1 million. In addition, approximately $1 million gain from the Aegis litigation settlement was recorded under this caption in 1994. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys statements of cash flows for the periods indicated are summarized below: FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 1994 1993 (IN THOUSANDS) Net cash provided by operating activities............ $34,501 $40,469 $ 8,468 Net cash used for investing activities............... 35,053 29,702 19,970 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities......................................... 10,990 238 (7,642) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash.............. (229) 990 (639) Increase (decrease) in cash.......................... $10,209 $11,995 $(19,783) Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $34.5 million during 1995 compared with $40.5 million during 1994. The difference was primarily due to a decrease in net income. Cash provided by operating activities was $40.5 million in 1994 compared with $8.5 million in 1993. This increase was due to an increase in net income coupled with a decrease in inventories due to improved inventory management during 1994. The Companys investing activities included principally capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. In addition, such activities in 1995 included the cash expenditures for the acquisition of two businesses, Photon Systems Corp. and Elastomeric Technologies Inc. for approximately $8 million. Capital expenditures were $20.4 million, $31.5 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1994 and 1995 respectively. The Company used these expenditures to purchase, modernize or upgrade production 13 16 equipment, maintain facilities and comply with environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for 1996 are expected to be approximately $30 to $35 million, principally related to improvements in (i) operating efficiencies and reliability, (ii) product quality, (iii) safety and working conditions and (iv) environmental practices. The costs of these capital projects are expected to be funded out of the Companys operating cash flow. Net cash flows used for financing activities were $7.6 million for 1993. Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $.2 million and $11.0 million for 1994 and 1995, respectively. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its operations under current business conditions. In 1994, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement with three banks to increase its maximum borrowing availability to $100 million through July 1997. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had $22.5 million in outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. Although the Company has the ability to finance these borrowings on a long term basis under its revolving credit agreement, it is managements intention to repay these borrowings during 1996 out of available working capital, and accordingly, the $22.5 million has been reported in the accompanying financial statements as a current liability. As a result of the restructuring charge in 1995, the Company would have violated certain requirements of its private placement senior note agreement relating to failure to maintain certain minimum financial ratios had the agreement not been amended during the fourth quarter of 1995. If the agreement is not renegotiated or refinanced, or if additional amendments are not received, the Company will be in default at March 31, 1996. The Company, which is currently investigating various long term financing alternatives, has the ability to prepay the notes utilizing proceeds from its revolving credit agreement. Accordingly, the private placement senior notes have been classified as noncurrent at December 31, 1995. During 1995, the Company made payments under its long term debt totaling $13.2 million. Although the Company had approximately $31 million in cash at December 31, 1995, a substantial portion of this amount is maintained outside the United States. These international cash balances may not be repatriated to the United States without incurring a significant tax cost. Therefore, the Company elected to borrow under its domestic revolving credit agreement in 1995 to support domestic operations and also to invest approximately $8 million in two acquisitions, Photon Systems Corp. and Elastomeric Technologies Inc. At December 31, 1995, the percentage of long term debt to equity was 10.4% of equity compared with 14.7% in 1994. Cash flow generated from operations along with available credit facilities is sufficient to cover expected growth in the next few years. Since 1992, the Company has spent approximately $1.2 million associated with environmental site remediation for certain facilities (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 1995, the Company had a liability for estimated environmental evaluation, assessment and remediation costs totaling approximately $6.0 million which is expected to be paid in equal amounts over the next fourteen years. The net after tax cash impact of the 1995 restructuring program is approximately $4 million over the next two years. The Company, in July, 1994, reinstated its quarterly common stock dividend. The current quarterly amount is $.04 per share. The book value of the Companys common stock at December 31, 1995 was $12.63. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. This standard, among other things, requires entities to review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Based upon current facts and circumstances, adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," encourages, but does not require, a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments. As permitted under the new standard, the Company anticipates that it will 14 17 continue to account for employee stock options as it has in the past under APB No. 25. The pro forma disclosures required by this standard will be adopted for the year ended December 31, 1996. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS In March 1996, the Company was notified by Ford Motor Company that Ford is proceeding with a plan to consolidate its suppliers. The first expected impact from this process to Augat is not until 1998 for various wiring cable porducts. Although the Company cannot at this time predict with certainty the future impact of the Ford consolidation plans, at the present time this could represent a reduction of approximately $15 20 million in sales volume in 1998. As part of this supplier base consolidation, Augat will also be discontinued as the harness supplier for the Mustang car platform effective in the fiscal year 2001. Similarly, the Mustang harnesses could represent approximately $30 40 million on a full year basis in reduced sales in 2002. The Company believes there may be some impact in 2001 but is unable at this time to quantify the magnitude of such impact. The Company has continued to implement programs within the automotive business to diversify both its products and customer base for the long term.
