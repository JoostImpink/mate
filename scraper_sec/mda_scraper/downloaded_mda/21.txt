Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. All references to we, us, our, or the Company in the following discussion and analysis mean Spectrum Control, Inc. and its Subsidiaries. Overview We design, develop and manufacture custom electronic components and systems. Although our components and systems are used in many industries worldwide, our largest individual markets are military/defense and communications equipment which represented 60% and 17%, respectively, of our fiscal 2010 sales. Military/defense applications for our products include secure communications, smart weapons and munitions, countermeasures for improvised explosive devices, radar systems, military aircraft and vehicles, and missile defense systems. In communications, our products are used in numerous systems including optical networks, broadband switching equipment, global positioning systems, wi fi, and wireless base stations. Other markets for our products include medical imaging equipment and instrumentation, industrial automation and controls, computers, IT hubs, and storage devices. Our operations are currently conducted in four reportable segments: advanced specialty products; microwave components and systems; power management systems; and sensors and controls. Our Advanced Specialty Products Business designs and manufactures a broad range of products including antennas, specialty connectors, advanced ceramics, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters and interconnects. Our Microwave Components and Systems Business designs and manufactures microwave filters and components, high power amplifiers, oscillators, synthesizers, switched filter banks, and related systems and integrated assemblies. The Power Management Systems Business designs and manufactures custom AC and DC power distribution units, power outlet strips, power monitoring equipment, and our Smart Start power management systems. Our Sensors and Controls Business designs and manufactures rotary and linear precision sensors, temperature sensing probes, thermistors, resistance temperature detector sensors, precision accelerometers, angular rate gyros, and inertial measurement systems and related assemblies. We recognize revenue when all significant contractual obligations have been met, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. As a result, product sales are generally recorded at the time of shipment when title passes under the terms FOB shipping point or Ex Works. Payments received from customers in advance of products shipped are recorded as deferred revenue until earned. Acquisitions On October 29, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Summit Instruments, Inc. (Summit). Based in Akron, Ohio, Summit designs and manufactures custom inertia sensors, accelerometers, inertial measurement systems, and related products and assemblies. A majority of Summits revenues are generated from military/defense applications, including missile defense systems. Summit products are also used in numerous commercial applications, such as wind turbines, industrial test equipment, and measurement instrumentation. The cash purchase price for Summit (net of cash received) was $5.4 million, which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit. On June 18, 2010, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Sage Laboratories, Inc. (Sage Labs). Sage Labs, based in Hudson, New Hampshire, designs and manufactures custom RF and microwave products including filters, diplexers, multiplexers, hybrids, and digital frequency discriminators. A majority of Sage Labs components and subsystems are used in defense and aerospace applications, including missile defense systems, electronic warfare, military aircraft, and radar systems. The aggregate cash purchase price for Sage Labs was $6.5 million, which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit. On June 18, 2010, in a separate transaction, we entered into an agreement with DRS Signal Solutions, Inc. (DRS) under which we acquired certain inventories, equipment, and a fully paid non royalty bearing license to manufacture and sell certain products using intellectual property owned by DRS. The aggregate cash purchase price for the acquired assets was $1.4 million, which was primarily funded from available cash reserves. The acquired assets are expected to be used to support certain specific customer programs over the next six years. 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) On November 30, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Micro Networks Corporation (Micro Networks), a subsidiary of Integrated Device Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: IDTI). Micro Networks, with operations in Worcester, Massachusetts and Auburn, New York, designs and manufactures high performance data conversion products, custom modules, and a broad line of filters, oscillators, and delay lines based on surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology. These products, and related SAW technology, are used in numerous defense and aerospace applications. The aggregate cash purchase price for Micro Networks was $12.9 million, which was partially funded by borrowings of $7.0 million under our domestic line of credit. We utilized our existing cash reserves to satisfy the balance of the purchase price. This acquisition occurred after the close of business on the last day of our 2009 fiscal year and therefore no revenues, expenses, or customer orders were recognized in our consolidated results of operations or related disclosures for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2009. On September 26, 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of SatCon Electronics, Inc. (SatCon). SatCon, based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, designs and manufactures high performance microelectronic components used in numerous military and commercial applications, including secure communication systems and high frequency wireless devices. These sophisticated products include hybrid components and subsystems, signal converters, and a full line of thin and thick film circuits. The aggregate cash purchase price for SatCon was $5.6 million, which was primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit. The results of operations of each of these acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Accordingly, our consolidated net sales for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008 include the following amounts related to these acquired businesses (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Summit $ 706 $ $ Sage Labs 5,708 DRS Micro Networks 11,753 SatCon 9,854 11,664 2,289 For operating segment purposes, Sage Labs, DRS, Micro Networks and SatCon are reported within our Microwave Components and Systems business segment. Summit is reported within our Sensors and Controls business segment.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. 28 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Executive Summary During fiscal 2010, our consolidated sales were $163.9 million, an increase of $31.6 million or 23.9% from fiscal 2009. Of this increase, $18.2 million was generated by our recent business acquisitions ($11.8 million from Micro Networks, $5.7 million from Sage Labs, and $706,000 from Summit). The remaining current year increase of $13.4 million was principally generated by additional product shipments to numerous commercial customers, reflecting the improvement in general economic conditions as well the impact of our new commercial product offerings. Overall, our total 2010 sales to military/defense customers amounted to $97.8 million, an increase of $16.9 million or 21.0% from 2009. Sales to commercial customers were $66.1 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $14.7 million or 28.6% from the prior year. Total customer orders received in fiscal 2010 amounted to $162.0 million, up $29.8 million from the preceding year. In fiscal 2010, our gross margin was $44.1 million or 26.9% of sales, compared to $34.4 million or 26.0% of sales in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin, as a percentage of sales, reflects the impact of leveraging fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes and reductions in direct labor costs from changes in sales mix. Selling, general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010 was $23.7 million or 14.4% of sales, compared to $20.8 million or 15.7% of sales in 2009. As a percentage of sales, selling expense decreased to 7.4% in fiscal 2010, compared to 8.6% in the preceding year. The decrease in selling expense, as a percentage of sales, reflects a decrease in our effective sales commission rate along with the impact of leveraging certain fixed selling expenses over greater sales volume. Aggregate general and administrative expense was $11.5 million in 2010, up $2.1 million from fiscal 2009. This increase includes: additional amortization expense of $668,000 associated with the identifiable intangible assets of our recent business acquisitions; additional compensation expense of $434,000, including equity based compensation; and professional fees of $418,000 incurred in connection with our three business acquisitions consummated in fiscal 2010. Overall, we generated net income of $12.8 million or $1.00 per share (98 cents diluted) in fiscal 2010, compared to net income of $8.6 million or 68 cents per share (67 cents diluted) in fiscal 2009. During the year ended November 30, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $19.5 million. This positive cash flow, along with our existing cash reserves, enabled us to expend $6.4 million on capital equipment additions, decrease our net bank borrowings by $6.1 million, as well as support the $13.4 million aggregate cash purchase price for the Sage Labs, DRS, and Summit acquisitions. At November 30, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 million, our current ratio was 4.46 to 1.00, and our total debt to equity was 0.22 to 1.00. 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain financial data, as a percentage of net sales, for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008: 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of products sold 73.1 74.0 74.9 Gross margin 26.9 26.0 25.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 14.4 15.7 14.9 Income from operations 12.5 10.3 10.2 Other income (expense) Interest expense (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Other income and expense, net 0.4 Income before provision for income taxes 12.4 10.1 10.3 Provision for income taxes 4.6 3.6 3.5 Net income 7.8 % 6.5 % 6.8 % The following table sets forth our net sales by reportable operating segments for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008 (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Advanced specialty products $ 51,155 $ 42,001 $ 52,060 Microwave components and systems 79,935 60,069 45,942 Power management systems 12,069 10,268 9,879 Sensors and controls 20,777 19,968 22,813 $ 163,936 $ 132,306 $ 130,694 2010 Compared to 2009 Net Sales Our consolidated net sales were $163.9 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $31.6 million or 23.9% from fiscal 2009. This sales increase reflects an aggregate impact of $18.2 million from our recent business acquisitions ($11.8 million from Micro Networks, $5.7 million from Sage Labs, and $706,000 from Summit). The remaining current year increase of $13.4 million was primarily driven by additional product shipments to numerous commercial customers, reflecting a partial rebound from the global recession, as well as the impact of several new commercial product offerings. Sales of our microwave components and systems were $79.9 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $19.9 million or 33.1% from fiscal 2009. This increase primarily reflects shipments from our Micro Networks and Sage Labs acquisitions of $11.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of Micro Networks and Sage Labs, sales of our microwave products increased by $2.4 million or 4.0% from the prior year. Our microwave components and systems are predominantly used in military/defense applications including secure communications, domestic and international missile defense systems, countermeasures for improvised explosive devices, electronic warfare, and radar systems. Total customer orders received for this business segment were $76.3 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $56.5 million in fiscal 2009. Sales of our advanced specialty products were $51.2 million in fiscal 2010, an increase of $9.2 million or 21.8% from a year ago. In 2010, sales of these products to customers in our commercial markets increased by approximately $7.7 million. This increase reflects the impact of our new product offerings in specialty connectors and antennas, along with the improvement in general economic conditions. In addition, shipments in support of various military/defense programs 30 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) increased by $1.5 million from a year ago. Total customer orders received for this business segment totaled $51.8 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $49.1 million in fiscal 2009. For our sensors and controls, sales for fiscal 2010 were $20.8 million, an increase of $809,000 or 4.1% from a year ago. This increase primarily reflects Summit shipments of $706,000. Shipments of our sensor products used in numerous industrial applications increased $1.9 million in fiscal 2010, reflecting new product offerings and improved overall market conditions. This increase was substantially offset by reduced shipments of our precision position sensors used in certain military vehicles. Customer orders received for our sensors and controls amounted to $22.9 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $15.8 million in fiscal 2009. For our power management systems, sales for fiscal 2010 were $12.1 million and customer orders received amounted to $11.1 million, up 17.5% and 2.4% from a year ago, respectively. In fiscal 2010, shipments for these products were particularly strong in electronic data storage and applications for our AC power strip products. Total customer orders received in fiscal 2010 amounted to $162.0 million, an increase of $29.8 million from the preceding year. At November 30, 2010, our sales order backlog was $82.2 million, up $9.0 million from the end of fiscal 2009. At November 30, 2010 our backlog reflects $7.9 million and $2.2 million of orders for Sage Labs and Summit, respectively. Overall, average selling prices remained relatively stable in 2010 for all of our major product lines. Gross Margin In fiscal 2010, our gross margin was $44.1 million or 26.9% of sales, compared to $34.4 million or 26.0% of sales in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin, as a percentage of sales, principally reflects changes in sales mix and better absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes. Total material costs amounted to $38.3 million or 23.4% of sales in fiscal 2010, versus $30.9 million or 23.3% of sales in the preceding year. Direct labor costs were $19.2 million or 11.7% of sales in 2010, compared to $16.2 million or 12.3% of sales in 2009. The changes in material costs and direct labor costs, as a percentage of sales, were primarily driven by changes in sales mix. Manufacturing overhead costs amounted to $62.3 million or 38.0% of sales in 2010, versus $50.8 million or 38.4% of sales in the preceding year. In fiscal 2010, the decrease in manufacturing overhead, as a percentage of sales, principally reflects the impact of leveraging fixed manufacturing overhead over greater sales volume. At November 30, 2010, we had a total workforce of 1,631 employees, which represents an increase of 16.6% from the end of last fiscal year. The 2010 fiscal year end workforce includes 55 employees from the Sage Labs acquisition and 19 employees from the Summit acquisition. We expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to enhance operating efficiencies, while maintaining flexibility for additional production requirements. Selling, General and Administrative Expense In fiscal 2010, selling expense amounted to $12.2 million or 7.4% of sales, compared to $11.4 million or 8.6% of sales in fiscal 2009. The decrease in selling expense, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflects a decrease to our effective sales commission rate from changes in sales mix, along with the impact of certain fixed selling expenses and greater sales volume. Aggregate general and administrative expense was $11.5 million in 2010, versus $9.4 million in 2009. The increase in general and administrative expense includes: $668,000 of additional amortization expense, primarily associated with the identifiable intangible assets of our recent business acquisitions; $434,000 of additional compensation expense, including equity based compensation; and $418,000 of legal and professional fees incurred in connection with our three business acquisitions consummated in fiscal 2010. In addition, 2009 general and administrative expense included a credit of $528,000, representing the excess of insurance recoveries over the carrying value of certain assets destroyed in two separate involuntary conversions. Interest Expense Total interest expense in fiscal 2010 was $100,000, a decrease of $90,000 from fiscal 2009, reflecting lower average interest rates. During the year ended November 30, 2010, weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to $4.0 million, with an average interest rate of 1.37%. During the year ended November 30, 2009, weighted average borrowings under the domestic line of credit were $3.8 million, with an average interest rate of 2.04%. 31 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.7% in 2010 and 36.1% in 2009, compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 40.0%. For the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, the difference between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate principally reflects state tax provisions and U.S. domestic production activities deductions. At November 30, 2010, we had recorded certain deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at November 30, 2010. 2009 Compared to 2008 Net Sales Our consolidated net sales were $132.3 million in fiscal 2009, an increase of $1.6 million or 1.2% from fiscal 2008. This increase primarily reflects the impact of twelve months of SatCon product sales and increased shipment levels for numerous military/defense applications. Offsetting much of this sales growth in fiscal 2009 was the global recession and its impact throughout most of our commercial markets. Sales of our microwave components and systems were $60.1 million in fiscal 2009, an increase of $14.1 million or 30.7% from fiscal 2008. SatCon product shipments increased in fiscal 2009 to $11.7 million, up $9.4 million from fiscal year 2008, representing SatCons first full year of sales. In addition, shipments of microwave products used in numerous military/defense applications increased in fiscal 2009, including microwave components and assemblies used in RCIED (Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices) Jammer Systems. Total customer orders received for our microwave components and systems were $56.5 million in fiscal 2009, versus $47.5 million in fiscal 2008. Sales of our advanced specialty products were $42.0 million in fiscal 2009, down $10.1 million or 19.3% from a year ago. In 2009, sales of these products to customers in our commercial markets were down by approximately $11.7 million. The soft commercial sales were partially offset by an increase of $1.6 million of shipments in support of various military/defense programs. Total customer orders received for this business segment totaled $49.1 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $55.9 million in fiscal 2008. For our sensors and controls, sales for fiscal 2009 were $20.0 million, down $2.8 million or 12.5% from a year ago. Shipments of these products used in military/defense applications (including aircraft cockpit controls and fin actuators, fighting vehicles, and smart weapons) increased $1.1 million in 2009, while product shipments into commercial markets decreased by $3.9 million. In fiscal 2009, demand for our temperature sensors and thermal products (which are used in various commercial food service applications, refrigeration, and HVAC equipment) was particularly soft. Customer orders received for our sensors and controls amounted to $15.8 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $26.6 million in fiscal 2008. For our power management systems, sales for fiscal 2009 were $10.3 million and customer orders received amounted to $10.8 million, up 3.9% and 2.7% from a year ago, respectively. In fiscal 2009, shipments for these products were particularly strong in electronic data storage and applications for our AC power strip products. Total customer orders received in fiscal 2009 amounted to $132.2 million, a decrease of $8.4 million from the preceding year. At November 30, 2009, our sales order backlog was $73.2 million, up $3.3 million from the end of fiscal 2008. This increase reflects $3.9 million of sales order backlog assumed as part of our acquisition of Micro Networks. Overall, average selling prices remained relatively stable in 2009 for all of our major product lines. Gross Margin In fiscal 2009, our gross margin was $34.4 million or 26.0% of sales, compared to $32.8 million or 25.1% of sales in fiscal 2008. The increase in gross margin, as a percentage of sales, principally reflects changes in sales mix and better absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead with higher production volumes. 32 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Total material costs amounted to $30.9 million or 23.3% of sales in fiscal 2009, versus $30.8 million or 23.5% of sales in the preceding year. Direct labor costs were $16.2 million or 12.3% of sales in 2009, compared to $16.8 million or 12.8% of sales in 2008. The decreases in direct material and direct labor costs, as a percentage of sales, were driven primarily by changes in sales mix. Manufacturing overhead costs amounted to $50.9 million or 38.4% of sales in 2009, versus $50.4 million or 38.6% of sales in the preceding year. In fiscal 2009, the increase in manufacturing overhead primarily reflects additional costs for employee health insurance, which was partially offset by numerous cost reduction programs. At November 30, 2009, we had a total workforce of 1,399 employees, including 73 Micro Networks employees, which represents a reduction of 7.7% from the end of fiscal 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expense In fiscal 2009, selling expense amounted to $11.4 million or 8.6% of sales, compared to $10.8 million or 8.3% of sales in fiscal 2008. The increase in selling expense, as a percentage of sales, primarily reflects an increase to our effective sales commission rate from changes in sales mix. Aggregate general and administrative expense was $9.4 million in 2009, versus $8.6 million in 2008. The increase in general and administrative expense includes $463,000 of additional incentive based compensation expense, $300,000 of expenses resulting from a legal settlement, as well as several other operating expense increases from additional business activity. These increases were partially offset by a $528,000 credit to general and administrative expense in fiscal 2009, representing the excess of insurance recoveries over the carrying value of certain assets destroyed in two separate involuntary conversions. Interest Expense With lower interest rates and reduced short term borrowings, our interest expense decreased in fiscal 2009. Total interest expense in fiscal 2009 was $190,000, a decrease of $179,000 from fiscal 2008. During the year ended November 30, 2009, weighted average borrowings under our domestic line of credit amounted to $3.8 million, with an average interest rate of 2.04%. During the year ended November 30, 2008, weighted average borrowings under the domestic line of credit were $4.9 million, with an average interest rate of 3.95%. Other Income and Expense For many years, we held certain United States and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer (PML) technology, and we had granted several licenses to other entities for the use of PML technology. In connection with our PML technology, we received license fee and royalty income of $340,000 in 2008. Since fiscal 2008, no license fees or royalty income have been earned or received, and all of the PML related patents have expired. Accordingly, we do not expect any PML related income in future periods. Our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency. As a result, we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transaction net losses of $60,000 in 2009 and $13,000 in 2008 were recognized and included in nonoperating income and expense. We realized interest income of $34,000 in 2009 and $178,000 in 2008 from temporary cash investments. The decrease in 2009 interest income primarily reflects reductions in money market interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.1% in 2009 and 34.3% in 2008, compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 40.0%. For the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, the difference between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate principally reflects state tax provisions, research activities tax credits, and U.S. domestic production activities deductions. At November 30, 2009, we had recorded certain deferred tax assets. Based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at November 30, 2009. 33 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition We maintain a domestic line of credit with our principal lending institution, PNC Bank, N.A. of Erie, Pennsylvania (the Bank), in the aggregate amount of $50.0 million. Borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property, and bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate. The Banks revolving credit commitment is scheduled to be permanently reduced in accordance with the following schedule: (i) $2,000,000 on December 31, 2010; (ii) $3,000,000 on June 30, 2011; and (iii) $5,000,000 on December 31, 2011. At November 30, 2010, $1.0 million was outstanding under this line of credit arrangement. The line of credit agreement contains certain covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability, and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness. At November 30, 2010 we were in compliance with all debt covenants. The current line of credit agreement expires in September 2014. Our ability to borrow in the future under this Bank credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants. Whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future, for which there can be no assurance. Our wholly owned German subsidiary maintains an unsecured Euro line of credit with a German financial institution aggregating approximately $1.3 million (Euro 1.0 million). At November 30, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit. Future borrowings, if any, will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand. In fiscal 2010, our net working capital and current ratio increased significantly, primarily reflecting reduced borrowings under our domestic line of credit and increased inventories from our recent business acquisitions and additional production requirements. At November 30, 2010 and 2009, net working capital was $55.1 million and $47.2 million, respectively. At November 30, 2010, our current assets were 4.46 times current liabilities, compared to 3.42 at the end of fiscal 2009. Our net working capital was $42.6 million at November 30, 2008 and our current ratio was 2.98 to 1.00 at the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, our working capital and current ratio were negatively impacted by $8.0 million of net borrowings under our domestic line of credit, which were used to fund our cash purchase price for the acquisition of SatCon and partially fund our stock repurchase program. In fiscal year 2010, we expended $6.4 million for capital additions and improvements. Of this amount, $1.8 million was for leasehold improvements to a facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts. This newly leased facility is being used by our Microwave Components and Systems Business to consolidate certain microwave operations, as well as increase manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies. The remainder of our 2010 capital expenditures principally relate to production expansion and improvements, particularly for our Advanced Specialty Products Business. Our capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $4.0 million in 2009, including $2.3 million in our Microwave Components and Systems Business. These capital expenditures primarily relate to production capacity and other manufacturing enhancements. Our capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $4.4 million in 2008, including $1.9 million in our Microwave Components and Systems Business and $1.4 million in our Advanced Specialty Products Business. The balance of our 2008 capital expenditures consists of normal replacements and enhancements of manufacturing equipment. At November 30, 2010, we had not entered into any material commitments for additional capital expenditures. We currently expect our aggregate capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to approximate our fiscal 2010 levels. In October 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Summit. The purchase price for Summit (net of cash received) was $5.4 million. In June 2010, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Sage Labs. The aggregate purchase price for Sage Labs was $6.5 million. The purchase prices for Summit and Sage Labs were primarily funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit. Also in June 2010, we acquired certain inventories, equipment, and a fully paid non royalty bearing license to manufacture and sell certain products using intellectual property owned by DRS. The aggregate purchase price was $1.4 million, which was primarily funded from available cash reserves. In November 2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Micro Networks. The aggregate cash purchase price for Micro Networks was $12.9 million, which was partially funded by borrowings of $7.0 million under our domestic line of credit. We utilized our existing cash reserves to satisfy the balance of the purchase price. In September 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of SatCon. The cash purchase price for SatCon was $5.6 million, which was substantially funded by borrowings under our domestic line of credit. We have adopted a stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may repurchase up to $16.0 million of the Companys outstanding Common Stock. Acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices. Funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility. The amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the Companys capital structure, liquidity, and the market price of the Companys Common Stock. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. During the years ended November 30, 2010 and 34 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2009, we did not repurchase any of our Common Stock. In 2008, we repurchased 1,001,479 shares at an aggregate cost of $8.2 million. Since the inception of the stock repurchase program, 1,677,479 shares have been repurchased at a total cost of $11.8 million. Research and development expenditures, which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes, amounted to $5.6 million in 2010, $4.4 million in 2009, and $3.7 million in 2008. We expect to continue our investment in research and development in 2011, as we continuously enhance existing product lines, design new products and processes, and increase our participation in emerging markets. Income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008 amounted to $4.2 million, $3.5 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. As a result of certain temporary differences and 2010 prepayments, we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be less than income tax expense for fiscal 2011. As of November 30, 2010, our obligations and firm commitments are as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long term debt $ 480 $ 70 $ 75 $ 80 $ 80 $ 85 $ 90 Operating leases 8,667 1,914 1,823 1,419 1,310 937 1,264 Current financial resources, including working capital and existing lines of credit, and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year 2011, including scheduled long term debt repayment, lease commitments, planned capital expenditures, research and development expenses, and possible stock repurchases. There can be no assurance, however, that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and, if so required, that it will be available on terms acceptable to us. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.5 million in 2010, $19.0 million in 2009, and $9.8 million in 2008. This increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects our enhanced profitability and changes in working capital requirements. In 2008, our operating cash flow was negatively impacted by a $3.3 million growth in inventories, principally reflecting replenishment of ceramic component safety stocks and additional work in process inventories in support of our increased production requirements. At November 30, 2010, goodwill represented 29.1% of our total assets and 35.4% of our stockholders equity. In addition to a total of $10.2 million of goodwill recognized in connection with our recent acquisitions of Summit, Sage Labs, Micro Networks, and SatCon, another $35.7 million of goodwill was realized in earlier acquisitions. In accordance with current accounting guidance, we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill (as of September 1 of each fiscal year) and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Certain of our European sales and related selling expenses are denominated in Euros, British Pounds Sterling, and other local currencies. In addition, certain of our operating expenses are denominated in Mexican Pesos and Chinese Yuan. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows. To manage our exposure to the Euro and British Pound Sterling, we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts. At November 30, 2010, we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding. For each of the three years ended November 30, 2010, currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Exposure We have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates. From time to time, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions, and we have never experienced nonperformance by any counterparties to these agreements. At November 30, 2010, no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding. 35 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Environmental Matters We own certain land and manufacturing facilities in State College, Pennsylvania. The property, which was acquired from Murata Electronics North America (Murata) in December 2005, consists of approximately 53 acres of land and 250,000 square feet of manufacturing facilities. Among other uses, the acquired facilities have become the design and manufacturing center for our ceramic operations, replacing the ceramic operations previously conducted in New Orleans, Louisiana. The purchase price for the acquired property consisted of: (a) $1.00, plus (b) closing costs of $695,000 including realtor commissions, transfer taxes, and legal fees; plus (c) the assumption of, and indemnification of Murata against, all environmental liabilities related to the property. The acquired property has known environmental conditions that require remediation, and certain hazardous materials previously used on the property have migrated into neighboring third party areas. These environmental issues arose from the use of chlorinated organic solvents including tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). As a condition to the purchase, we entered into an agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) pursuant to which: (a) we agreed to remediate all known environmental conditions relating to the property to a specified industrial standard, with our costs for remediating such conditions being capped at $4.0 million; (b) PADEP released Murata from further claims by Pennsylvania under specified state laws for the known environmental conditions; and (c) we purchased an insurance policy providing clean up cost cap coverage (for known and unknown pollutants) with a combined coverage limit of approximately $8.2 million, and pollution legal liability coverage (for possible third party claims) with an aggregate coverage limit of $25.0 million. The total premium cost for the insurance policy, which has a ten year term and an aggregate deductible of $650,000, was $4.8 million. The cost of the insurance associated with the environmental clean up ($3.6 million) is being charged to general and administrative expense in direct proportion to the actual remediation costs incurred. The cost of the insurance associated with the pollution legal liability coverage ($1.2 million) is being charged to general and administrative expense on a pro rata basis over the ten year policy term. Based upon our environmental review of the property, we recorded a liability of $2.9 million to cover probable future environmental expenditures related to the remediation, the cost of which is expected to be entirely covered by the insurance policy. As of November 30, 2010, remediation expenditures of $2.2 million have been incurred and charged against the environmental liability, with all such expenditures being reimbursed by the insurance carrier. The remaining aggregate undiscounted expenditures of $713,000, which are anticipated to be incurred over the next five years, principally consist of: (a) continued operation and monitoring of the existing on site groundwater extraction, treatment, and recharge system; (b) completion of soil investigations to determine the extent of potential soil contamination; (c) excavation and off site disposal of soil containing contaminates above acceptable standards; and (d) implementation of soil vapor extraction systems in certain areas. Depending upon the results of future environmental testing and remediation actions, it is possible that the ultimate costs incurred could exceed the current aggregate estimate of $2.9 million. We expect such increase, if any, to be entirely covered by the insurance policy. Insurance recoveries for actual environmental remediation costs incurred are recorded when it is probable that such insurance reimbursement will be received and the related amounts are determinable. Such insurance recoveries are credited to the Companys general and administrative expense. Based on the current remediation plan, $280,000 of the total remediation costs are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. U.S. federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act. We also are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal agencies, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations. As part of our continuing environmental program, we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business. We are not currently involved in any significant legal proceedings involving environmental matters. Other Legal Matters We are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Impact of Inflation In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, we continuously monitor operating price increases, particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors and microwave products. To the extent permitted by competition, we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time. Sales price increases, however, were not significant in any of the years presented herein. Recent Accounting Pronouncements ASC 805 10, Business Combinations In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 805 10, Business Combinations. The objective of this accounting guidance is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. Specifically, it establishes principles and requirements over how the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain price; and (3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. ASC 805 10 changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition related costs and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition. This accounting guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (the Companys 2010 fiscal year), with early adoption prohibited. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we incurred acquisition related costs of $418,000 in connection with three business acquisitions. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 805 10, these acquisition related costs were charged to general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. ASC 350 30 35, Intangibles Other Than Goodwill Subsequent Remeasurements In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 350 30 35, Intangibles Other Than Goodwill Subsequent Remeasurements, which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. These provisions apply to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of assets and intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions. Furthermore, these provisions remove the provision that requires an entity to consider whether the renewal or extension can be accomplished without substantial cost or material modifications of the existing terms and conditions associated with the asset. Instead, these provisions require that an entity consider its own experience in renewing similar arrangements. An entity would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal if no such relevant experience exists. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2008 (the Companys 2010 fiscal year). The adoption of this accounting guidance, effective December 1, 2009, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2010. ASC 805 20 25, Business Combinations Recognition of Identifiable Assets and Liabilities and Any Noncontrolling Interests In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 805 20 25, Business Combinations Recognition of Identifiable Assets and Liabilities and Any Noncontrolling Interests, which applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies that would be within the scope of ASC 450, Contingencies, if not acquired or assumed in a business combination, except for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies that are subject to specific guidance in ASC 805 10, Business Combinations. These provisions require an acquirer to recognize at fair value, at the acquisition date, an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition date fair value cannot be determined during the measurement period, the asset or liability shall be recognized at the acquisition date if it is probable that the asset existed or that a liability has been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (the Companys 2010 fiscal year). The adoption of this accounting guidance, effective December 1, 2009, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2010. 37 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Critical Accounting Policies The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable, inventories, long lived assets, and deferred tax assets. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customers financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due. At November 30, 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $955,000 or approximately 3.6% of our aggregate accounts receivable. In determining the adequacy of this allowance, we have assumed that conditions in our major served markets (military/defense, communications equipment, and medical/industrial instrumentation) will not significantly deteriorate during fiscal 2011. If current economic and market conditions do significantly deteriorate, our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. Accordingly, our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount. At November 30, 2010, we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million for excess and slow moving items. In determining the adequacy of these reserves, we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage. Should these forecasts and estimates change due to market, technological or other factors, the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, which we have identified as our operating segments, and is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors, including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach. The discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions, including forecasted operating results and discount rates. Inherent in the forecasted operating results are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected cost saving initiatives, and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. We perform our goodwill impairment testing as of September 1 of each year. For each of the fiscal years presented herein, no impairments were identified. No reporting units were deemed to be at risk of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test under ASC No. 350. Long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist. Impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values. No impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein. However, our future cash flow expectations assume that the general economic climate and conditions within our major served markets will improve within the next few years. If long term market conditions do not improve, or in fact deteriorate, our long lived assets may become materially impaired. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income. 38 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized. Presently, we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required. We evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed. These adjustments, when made, may have a materially negative impact on our consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents
