ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview ATS Medical, Inc. (hereinafter the Company, ATS, we, us or our) develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for the treatment of structural heart disease used by cardiovascular surgeons in the cardiac surgery operating theater. Currently, we participate in the markets for heart valve therapy including mechanical bileaflet replacement heart valves, tissue heart valves and valve repair products and the surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, primarily the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, a small portion of our business is comprised of surgical tools and accessories used by the cardiac surgeon for the treatment of structural heart disease. In 1990, we licensed a patented and partially developed mechanical heart valve from CarboMedics, Inc. Under the terms of the license, we would complete the development of the valve and agreed to purchase carbon components from CarboMedics. As a result, ATS now holds an exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to an open pivot, bileaflet mechanical heart valve design owned by CarboMedics. In addition, we have an exclusive, worldwide right and license to use CarboMedics pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ATS mechanical heart valve. We commenced selling the ATS mechanical heart valve in international markets in 1992. In 2000, we received FDA approval to sell the ATS Open Pivot mechanical heart valve and commenced sales and marketing of our valve in the United States. During 2002, we reorganized the Company and began the process of rebuilding our sales and marketing teams, both in the United States and internationally. This rebuilding has been a significant factor in our operating expense levels since 2002. During 2004 and 2005, we developed and implemented a plan to ramp up our own manufacturing facility for pyrolytic carbon. By the end of 2005, this process was substantially complete. During 2004, we made our first investments outside the mechanical heart valve market. We completed a global partnership agreement with CryoCath Technologies, Inc. to market CryoCaths surgical cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. CryoCath developed a portfolio of novel products marketed under the SurgiFrost and FrostByte trade names which are used by cardiac surgeons to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment is accomplished through the creation of an intricate pattern of lesions on the surface of the heart to block inappropriate electrical conduction circuits which cause the heart to be less effective when pumping blood and can lead to stroke, heart failure and death. Unique to this technology is the use of cryothermy (cold) to create lesions. The agreement with CryoCath has resulted in revenues for ATS since 2005. During 2005, we continued to expand our business outside the mechanical heart valve market. We entered into an exclusive development, supply and distribution agreement with Genesee BioMedical, Inc. under which GBI develops, supplies and manufactures cardiac surgical products to include annuloplasty repair rings and bands and accessories, and we have exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell such products. Our agreement with GBI has produced revenues for us since 2006. In 2006, we completed the acquisition of all the voting and non voting stock of 3F Therapeutics, Inc., an early stage privately held medical device company at the forefront of the emerging field of minimally invasive open and closed chest tissue valve replacement. The acquisition of 3F was a major step in the execution of our long standing vision of obtaining a leadership position in the major segments of the cardiac surgery market. The acquisition was consummated pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, as amended (the Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon closing, we paid each 3F stockholder its pro rata portion of an initial payment of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments. In December 2009, we issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock to 3F stockholders under the Merger Agreement upon obtaining the European CE mark on our Enable Aortic Bioprosthesis sutureless tissue valve product. In addition, we are obligated under the Merger Agreement to make an additional contingent payment to 3F stockholders of up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock with shares issuable upon obtaining U.S. FDA approval on the Enable product or FDA or European CE mark approval for certain future key products acquired in the 3F acquisition on or prior to December 31, 2013. Milestone share payments may be accelerated upon completion of certain transactions involving these future key products. The first generation tissue valve of the 3F portfolio, the ATS 3f Aortic 28 Table of Contents Bioprosthesis, has received both FDA approval and the European CE mark and is available for sale in the United States, Europe and certain other international markets. In December 2009, we received European CE Mark approval of our second tissue valve, the sutureless ATS 3f Enable Aortic Bioprosthesis, which is intended to enable less invasive aortic valve replacement. We are also developing an aortic tissue valve for use in beating heart procedures based in part on the characteristics of the next generation of Enable valves. First in human studies of this technology is targeted for 2010, and if successful, commercialization of a beating heart solution could occur within one to two years thereafter. Also in 2006, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Novare Surgical Systems, Inc. (Novare). Novare is the owner of the Enclose II cardiac anastomosis assist device, which is a device used by cardiac surgeons to attach a bypass vessel to the aorta during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Under the terms of the agreement, we held the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute the Enclose II product in the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. We discontinued selling the Enclose II device in August 2009. In June 2007, we acquired the cryoablation surgical device business of CryoCath. The acquisition included the SurgiFrost, FrostByte and SurgiFrost XL family of products for which we had served as CryoCaths exclusive agent in the United States and distributor in certain international markets. Under the acquisition agreement, we paid CryoCath $22.0 million upon closing of the transaction (reduced by $0.9 million subsequent to closing) and $2.0 million during 2008 upon the achievement of certain manufacturing transition milestones. We also paid $2.0 million in June 2009 (two years after closing) and agreed to pay up to $4.0 million in contingent payments based on future sales of Surgifrost XL, an FDA cleared and CE Marked product designed to enable less evasive ablations. Based on the results of extensive bench and pre clinical testing as well as human feasibility studies, the Company discontinued development of the SurgiFrost XL product in late 2008. The Company continues to develop less invasive procedures utilizing its existing set of tools. The acquisition of the cryoablation surgical device business of CryoCath enables us to leverage our current operating infrastructure and allows us to better address the rapidly growing cardiac arrhythmia market within cardiac surgery. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States as set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect (1) the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and (2) the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to, those related to accounts receivable, inventories, long lived and intangible assets and income taxes. The critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below. Revenue Recognition Policy. A significant portion of our revenue in the United States and in our direct European sales operations is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives. In these situations, revenue is recognized at the time that the product has been implanted or used. In all other instances, revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped. Certain independent distributors in select international markets receive rebates against invoiced sales amounts. In these situations, we accrue for these rebates at the time of the original sale. These rebates are treated as a reduction of revenue and have not been significant. We include shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated using subjective judgments and estimates to establish this valuation account. Our distribution in international markets through independent distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts. We have successfully done business with most of these distributors for many years. We monitor amounts that are not paid according to terms. We attempt to accrue for potential losses due to non payment. Financial conditions in international markets can change very quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes. Our allowance for 29 Table of Contents doubtful accounts was approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The allowance as a percentage of total accounts receivable was 2.8% and 2.4% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Inventory Valuation. Inventories are recorded and relieved at the lower of manufacturing cost (first in, first out basis) or market (net realizable value). We maintain allowances and reserves against certain finished goods and work in process inventories to cover obsolete and short shelf life product, scrap and rework costs and resterilization costs for expired or near expired items. These allowances and reserves totaled $1.1 million and $1.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess the carrying value of goodwill, our only indefinite lived intangible asset, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. We review goodwill for impairment annually as of the last day of the second quarter, or more frequently if a change in circumstances or occurrence of events suggests the remaining value may not be recoverable. The test for impairment requires management to make estimates about fair value which are based either on the expected present value of future cash flows or on other measures of value such as the market capitalization of the Company. If the carrying amount of the assets is greater than the measures of fair value, impairment is considered to have occurred and a write down of the asset is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets consist of purchased technology and patents, technology licenses and agreements, trademarks, trade names and distribution intangibles, which are carried at amortized cost. The Company assesses definite lived intangible asset impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 360 10 35, Property, Plant and Equipment Overall Subsequent Measurement. If a triggering event occurs, the Company assesses the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets by reference to future gross profit cash flows from the underlying products utilizing the capitalized intangible assets. As of December 31, 2009, we completed impairment testing on all of our intangible assets and determined that the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, were not impaired, were recoverable and that no impairment charges were necessary. During 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 million related to licensing fee and development milestone payments made to a Swedish research firm related to blood filtration technology for cardiac surgery procedures. Convertible Debt and Derivative Instruments. We account for embedded derivatives related to our Convertible Senior Notes under FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and applicable SEC rules, which require certain embedded derivative financial instruments to be bifurcated from the debt agreement and accounted for as a liability. Our Convertible Senior Notes contain several embedded derivatives. The valuation of derivatives requires management to make certain judgments and estimates, including the potential future fair value of our common stock, the probability of a change in control of the Company and the probability that the debt may be put back to or called by us. Fair Value Measurements. We apply fair value measurement accounting principles related to our Convertible Senior Notes derivative liability, goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities pursuant to FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for a discussion of the application of ASC 820 to specific assets and liabilities. Deferred Tax Assets. We have incurred cumulative tax losses of approximately $167 million. The losses are carried forward for U.S. and state corporate income taxes and can be used to reduce future taxable income. As a result, at December 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets totaling approximately $64.2 million. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against these assets because of the limited lives of the carryforwards and our lack of earnings history, which has resulted in our conclusion that it is not more than likely we will be able to utilize our loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize a portion of our cumulative tax losses to offset future taxable income is subject to certain limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in the equity ownership of the Company. In addition, 3Fs tax loss carryforwards may also be limited by separate return limitation year rules. 30 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation. We account for our stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation, which requires all share based payments to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. We issue both stock options and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) to our employees. The fair value of stock option grants is determined based on the Black Scholes Merton (Black Scholes) option pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the closing market price on the award date. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements impacting our Company.

Our mechanical heart valve products continue to be our primary product line and comprised approximately 61%, 65% and 72% of our total worldwide sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and 82%, 90% and 93% of total heart valve therapy revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Surgical arrhythmia therapy products consist of cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. We acquired this business from CryoCath in June 2007. Surgical tools and accessories consist primarily of cardiac anastomosis assist devices (which we discontinued selling in August 2009) and thoracic port systems. Net sales for all periods have been favorably impacted by revenue from the acquisitions, new products and new business initiatives and partnerships discussed above. Approximately 39% of our worldwide revenue in 2009 was derived from products other than mechanical heart valves, up from approximately 35% in 2008 and 28% in 2007. 2009 compared to 2008. Worldwide heart valve therapy revenue increased 18% in 2009. A primary driver of this increase was tissue heart valve revenue, which increased 276% in 2009 to $5.6 million (compared to $1.5 million in 2008) due primarily to the limited U.S. commercial launch of the Companys first generation tissue valve product, the ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis, approved by the FDA in October 2008. U.S. tissue valve revenue comprised approximately 55% of total tissue valve revenue for 2009. Worldwide mechanical heart valve revenue for 2009 increased 7% from 2008 due to stronger mechanical heart valve sales in Asia and certain developing markets. Heart valve repair revenue increased 45% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the introduction of our semi rigid line of repair rings in 2008 as well as to continued sales growth of our existing repair ring products. Surgical arrhythmia therapy revenue for 2009 increased 12% compared to 2008. Cryotherapy products in general and CryoMaze procedural growth in particular has benefited from the overall growth of the surgical ablation market and increased market acceptance of cryo energy (cold) as a preferred technology to perform Cox Maze lesion sets. Our total net sales increase for 2009 of 15% was negatively impacted by approximately 210 basis points related to lower foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar during 2009. Approximately 20% of our total sales for 2009 were invoiced in Euros or other local currencies in European markets where we sell our products directly to hospitals. 2008 compared to 2007. Heart valve therapy revenue increased 23% in 2008 compared to 2007 due primarily to higher international mechanical heart valve revenue, which increased approximately 26% in 2008, attributable to the expansion of direct selling operations in certain international markets and to stronger mechanical heart valve sales in developing markets. U.S. mechanical heart valve revenue in 2008 increased 2% from 2007, the result of the introduction of a new mechanical valve offering in 2008, the AP 360 valve, which allowed us to take market share from competitors. Tissue heart valve revenue increased 173% in 2008 to $1.5 million, driven primarily by a limited commercial launch in certain western European markets. Heart valve repair revenue increased 80% in 2008 to $3.2 million, due to the introduction of our semi rigid line of repair rings in the first quarter of 2008 as well as to continued sales growth of our existing repair ring products. 33 Table of Contents Surgical arrhythmia therapy revenue in 2008 of $16.9 million increased 74% compared to 2007. The most significant driver of the revenue increase was our acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath in June 2007. Prior to this date we served as an agent and received a commission on the majority of the sales transactions. After the acquisition our revenue is representative of end user pricing and the addition of more direct customers and geographies where CryoCath had previously maintained direct distribution. CryoMaze procedural growth has benefited from the overall growth of the surgical ablation market and increased market acceptance of cryo energy as a preferred technology to perform Cox Maze lesion sets. Approximately 200 basis points of our 32.7% increase in net sales for 2008 compared to 2007 is attributable to higher average foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 23% of our total sales in 2008 were invoiced in Euros or other local currencies in European markets where we sell our products direct to hospitals. Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 2009 compared to 2008. Our 2009 gross profit percentage of net sales improved to 64.6%, an increase of 300 basis points compared to 61.6% in 2008. Our 2009 gross profit benefited significantly from lower product manufacturing costs, particularly for mechanical heart valves. The cost declines are attributable primarily to higher manufacturing volumes as a result of increased demand enabling greater leverage of overhead and fixed costs and to product cost reduction initiatives. Lower product costs increased our 2009 gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately 500 basis points compared to 2008. Also contributing to the higher 2009 gross profit percentage were higher U.S. average selling prices, attributable in large part to tissue valves, which increased our 2009 gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately 10 basis points compared to 2008. Partially offsetting the improved 2009 gross profit percentage of net sales were lower international selling prices due to foreign currency exchange rate changes and geographical sales mix shifts resulting from higher sales growth in lower margin developing countries, which had a net unfavorable impact on our 2009 gross profit percentage of net sales of approximately 210 basis points compared to the prior year. 2008 compared to 2007. Our 2008 gross profit was 61.6% of revenue, which represents an increase of 470 basis points compared to 56.9% in 2007. Our 2008 gross profit, both in dollars and in percentage of net sales, benefited from lower cost internally manufactured mechanical heart valves as production significantly increased in 2008 to meet increased mechanical heart valve demand, primarily in international markets. Greater leverage of manufacturing labor and overhead in 2008 resulted in a 15% reduction in our mechanical heart valve cost of goods sold per unit compared to 2007 and contributed to an overall 220 basis points increase in gross profit percentage of net sales. Our 2008 gross profit percentage of net sales also benefited, by approximately 90 basis points, from higher international average selling prices associated with our expansion of direct selling efforts in certain European markets and appreciation of the Euro against the dollar compared to 2007. Direct sales of surgical cryotherapy products after our acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath in late June 2007 contributed 260 basis points to our 2008 increase in gross profit percentage of net sales. These sales included the gross up on certain sales for which we had served as an agent and received a commission prior to the acquisition and the addition of direct sales to other CryoCath corporate customers. Partially offsetting the improved 2008 gross profit percentage of net sales were shifts in the overall sales mix, both geographic and product related. The most significant sales mix impact was related to product mix shifts during 2008 from higher margin mechanical heart valve products to lower margin cryotherapy and repair ring products, which negatively impacted the 2008 overall gross profit percentage of net sales by approximately 130 basis points compared to 2007. Sales and Marketing 2009 compared to 2008. In the United States, our sales and marketing costs for 2009 increased 12.8% over 2008 to $18.7 million. The increase reflects higher marketing program costs, particularly related to the launch of the ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis tissue valve in the United States and marketing programs for our cryoablation business, as well as additional marketing personnel. Field selling costs in the United States were higher by 8.8% for 2009 compared to 2008, reflecting hospital sales program costs as well as higher 34 Table of Contents independent sales agent and territory manager commissions connected with increased 2009 sales in the United States. Internationally, our sales and marketing costs for 2009 increased 10.4% over 2008 to $11.9 million. The increase is attributable primarily to 2009 severance and restructuring charges for our international sales organization of approximately $1.1 million and to higher costs associated with our continuing investment in international markets, evidenced by the establishment of a European support office in Belgium during the second half of 2008 to continue the support and expansion of our direct sales operations in Europe. These increases were offset in part by the impact of lower Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates during 2009 than 2008. More than 80% of our 2009 international sales and marketing costs are denominated in Euros. Also offsetting the increases in sales and marketing costs discussed above were lower 2009 corporate incentive compensation accruals of $0.7 million. 2008 compared to 2007. In the United States, our sales and marketing costs in 2008 increased approximately 10% over the prior year, to $16.6 million. The increase reflects costs for additional marketing personnel ($0.6 million), higher marketing program costs ($0.3 million) and higher achievement under incentive compensation plans ($0.5 million). Field selling costs in the United States were largely flat in 2008 compared to the prior year, reflecting the 2007 turnover and reduction in field sales personnel offset by higher sales commissions in 2008. Internationally, our sales and marketing costs in 2008 increased approximately 12% over 2007 to $10.7 million. The increase reflects our continued investment in international markets, including the establishment of a European support office during the second half of 2008 to support the expansion of our direct sales operations in Europe ($0.2 million) and the commencement of direct sales activities in Switzerland in the third quarter of 2007 ($0.5 million), and higher achievement under incentive compensation plans ($0.3 million). Our higher 2008 international sales and marketing costs were also attributable to rising Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates, which accounted for approximately one half of the year over year increase. More than 75% of our international sales and marketing costs in 2008 were denominated in Euros. Research and Development 2009 compared to 2008. Research and development (R D) expenses for 2009 increased 7.9% over 2008 to $8.9 million. The increase reflects stepped up investment in new product and technology programs, particularly for minimally invasive tissue heart valve platforms and the Forcefield program, as well as headcount additions and the allocation of stock compensation expense to R D beginning in 2009. These cost increases were partially offset by lower clinical affairs expenses connected with the timing of clinical trial enrollments for tissue valves and lower 2009 corporate incentive compensation accruals of $0.5 million. R D expense fluctuations are generally related to the timing and stages of development project cycles. 2008 compared to 2007. R D expenses for 2008 increased approximately 9% compared to the prior year to $8.2 million. The increase in R D reflects higher clinical program and product approval costs for tissue heart valves ($0.9 million) primarily related to the U.S. approval of our first tissue valve offering, the ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis, and the enrollment ramp up in our Enable clinical trial during 2008. Also contributing to the higher R D costs were corporate bonus plan accruals ($0.6 million) and increases in both R D personnel and programs ($0.7 million). Partially offsetting these increases in 2008 R D spending was a decline in tissue valve R D spending ($1.1 million) and transfers of costs related to R D clinical product builds, prototypes and testing devices ($0.3 million) as our tissue valve products advanced through the regulatory approval process. Acquired In Process R D In connection with our 2007 acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath, we recorded a non recurring in process R D (IPRD) charge of $3.5 million. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding the CryoCath acquisition, including the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price. The IPRD relates to SurgiFrost XL, a product designed to enable less invasive stand alone or sole therapy solutions to treat atrial fibrillation. 35 Table of Contents Based on the results of extensive bench and pre clinical testing as well as human feasibility studies, we discontinued development of SurgiFrost XL product in late 2008. General and Administrative 2009 compared to 2008. General and administrative (G A) expenses for 2009 decreased 5.7% from 2008. The primary driver behind this result was significantly lower legal fees in 2009 ($1.8 million) after the fourth quarter 2008 settlement of the litigation with CarboMedics. Also contributing to lower 2009 G A expense was lower corporate incentive compensation accruals of $0.5 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher consulting and outside services costs ($0.7 million) and higher compensation and benefits expenses ($0.3 million). In 2009 and 2008, we recognized total stock compensation expense of $2.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Stock compensation expense has been allocated to cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, R D and G A expenses as indicated in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. The increase in stock compensation expense is attributable primarily to new equity grants and awards and to fewer forfeitures. 2008 compared to 2007. G A expenses for 2008 increased $0.1 million over 2007 to $10.5 million. Major cost increases in G A expenses in 2008 were for legal fees (primarily related to the CarboMedics litigation) of $1.2 million and corporate incentive compensation plan accruals of $0.3 million. These cost increases were offset by $0.7 million in employee severance costs and $0.4 million of business development expenses incurred in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008, as well as $0.3 million of lower consulting and outside services fees in 2008. In 2008 and 2007, we recognized total stock compensation expense of $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, stock compensation expense was allocated to sales and marketing and G A expenses as indicated in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K. The increase in stock compensation expense for 2008 over 2007 reflects primarily an increase in equity grants and awards in 2008 at higher closing stock prices. Litigation Settlement In December 2008, we settled ongoing litigation with CarboMedics which began in 2007 and was related to our supply agreement with CarboMedics for certain mechanical heart valve components. As part of the settlement, we paid $7.5 million to CarboMedics, $3.0 million of which was paid in December 2008 and $4.5 million of which was paid in April 2009. Under the terms of the settlement, we maintain all rights to manufacture, market and sell our ATS Open Pivot mechanical heart valve. Satisfaction of the settlement terms will conclude all related matters with CarboMedics and preclude any future litigation on the matter in question. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for more information regarding the CarboMedics litigation and settlement. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization expense includes amortization of our pyrolytic carbon technology license with CarboMedics and amortization of the definite lived intangible assets acquired in our 2007 purchase of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath and our 2006 acquisition of 3F. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for more information regarding our intangible assets and amortization of our definite lived intangible assets. We estimate amortization expense for 2010 to total approximately $3.2 million. Impairment of Intangibles We made licensing fee and development milestone payments to ErySave AB (ErySave), a Swedish research firm, under an exclusive development and licensing agreement, executed in 2004, for worldwide rights to ErySaves PARSUS filtration technology for cardiac surgery procedures. In July 2007, we were informed that ErySave was in the process of declaring bankruptcy and they could not continue development work. Accordingly, the $0.8 million ErySave license payments intangible asset was written off during fiscal 2007. 36 Table of Contents Net Interest Expense The primary components of our net interest expense are: (1) commitment fees and amortization of deferred financing costs related to the June 2008 Subordinated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) and Revolving Credit Facility (Credit Facility) with Theodore C. Skokos, (2) interest on the $8.6 million Term Loan (Term Loan) with Silicon Valley Bank obtained in connection with the June 2007 acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath, and (3) interest on the $22.4 million aggregate principal amount of 6% Convertible Senior Notes issued in 2005. Interest expense on the Convertible Senior Notes includes amortization of (a) deferred financing costs, (b) the discount related to the implied value of common stock warrants sold with the Convertible Senior Notes, and (c) the discounts related to the bifurcated Convertible Senior Notes derivatives. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for more information regarding all of these debt instruments. 2009 compared to 2008. Net interest expense for 2009 was relatively flat compared to 2008, reflecting lower interest on the declining principal balance of our loan with Silicon Valley bank offset by lower interest income on cash and investment balances and higher commitment fee and deferred financing costs related to the June 2008 Credit Facility with Mr. Skokos. 2008 compared to 2007. Net interest expense for 2008 increased $0.9 million over the prior year. The 2008 increase was attributable in large part to a decrease in interest income on declining cash and investment balances during 2008. Interest income in 2008 and 2007 was $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Also contributing to the 2008 increase in net interest expense was interest on the June 2007 Term Loan with Silicon Valley Bank obtained in connection with the CryoCath asset acquisition. Net Other Income The following table summarizes our net other income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands). Year ended December 31: 2009 2008 2007 Alta Partners VIII, L.P. (Alta) warrant liability gain (loss) $ $ 243 ($652 ) Convertible Senior Notes derivative liability gain 34 51 98 Net realized foreign currency transaction gains 246 472 303 Unrealized foreign currency gain (loss) related to intercompany balances with foreign subsidiaries 54 (353 ) 312 Other 57 Net other income $ 391 $ 413 $ 61 In our June 2007 private equity placement in connection with the acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath, we sold to Alta, a life sciences venture capital firm, 9,800,000 shares of our common stock and a seven year warrant to purchase up to 1,960,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.65 per share. The Company was required to treat the warrant as a liability pending approval of its shareholders at the Companys 2008 annual meeting of shareholders to provide shares of common stock issuable to Alta upon exercise of the warrant. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrant was recorded as a liability on the date of issuance and marked to market at each quarter end. At the annual meeting of shareholders in May 2008, we received shareholder approval to issue shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrant. Consequently, the warrant liability was marked to market through the date of shareholder approval and the remaining liability was credited to additional paid in capital. Since 2005 we have recorded non operating other income for the change in fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes derivative liability. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for more information regarding the Convertible Senior Notes derivative liability. Net other income also includes net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, including unrealized foreign currency gains and losses related to short term intercompany balances with foreign subsidiaries. These gains and losses have increased since 2006 due to larger fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 relates to: (1) deferred income taxes connected with the deductibility of goodwill from the CryoCath acquisition for tax purposes, but not for book purposes, and the uncertainty of the timing of its reversal for book purposes, (2) current income taxes for certain of our European sales and distribution subsidiaries, and (3) provisions for taxes resulting from open international tax audits. In future years, we will continue recognizing deferred income tax expense related to the CryoCath goodwill over its tax life as long as there is no impairment of the goodwills recorded value. Through 2009 we have accumulated approximately $167 million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes ($59 million related to 3F). We believe that our ability to fully utilize the existing NOL carryforwards could be restricted on a portion of the NOL by changes in control that may have occurred or may occur in the future and by our ability to generate net income. We are conducting a formal study of whether, or to what extent, past changes in control of ATS impair our NOL carryforwards. We have recorded no net deferred tax asset related to our NOL carryforwards and other deferred items as we currently cannot determine that it is more likely than not that this asset will be realized and we, therefore, have provided a valuation allowance for the entire asset. Net Loss Our net losses in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $6.3 million, $19.3 million and $23.0 million, respectively. Our decrease in net loss in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to significantly higher sales and gross profit, the absence of the 2008 CarboMedics litigation settlement expense and smaller changes in operating expenses and non operating income, all of which are described in detail above. Our decrease in net loss in 2008 compared to 2007 was also due to significantly higher sales and gross profit as well as to the absence of acquisition related IPRD in 2008, partially offset by higher operating expenses and the settlement of the CarboMedics litigation, all of which are described in detail above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments totaled $14.2 million and $20.9 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Operating Activities During 2009, we received cash payments from customers of approximately $75.9 million and made payments to employees and suppliers of approximately $87.0 million. Included in our cash payments for 2009 was a $4.5 million payment related to the settlement of the CarboMedics litigation. During 2008, we received cash payments from customers of approximately $62.5 million and made payments to employees and suppliers of approximately $72.0 million. Since 2002, we have incurred significant expenses to support the commercialization of ATS products both in the United States and international markets, have invested in new products and technologies and have completed strategic acquisitions and business partnerships to diversify our product portfolio. As we grow sales in future periods, better leverage our operating expenses and continue to drive declines in our product manufacturing costs, we believe our operating losses will continue to decrease and we will move toward a cash flow breakeven on sales and eventually to full year profitability. Investing Activities We purchased leasehold improvements, property and equipment totaling $2.4 million, $1.4 million and $0.7 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital spending in 2009 focused on information technology, manufacturing improvement projects and capitalized cryoablation hardware placed at hospitals. A significant portion of our capital spending in 2008 was related to the addition of a surgical cryoablation production clean room at our Plymouth, Minnesota location following the 2007 acquisition of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath. 38 Table of Contents Our major investing activity since the beginning of 2007 has been the acquisition of the assets of the surgical cryoablation business of CryoCath. We paid $22 million at the closing in June 2007 (subsequently reduced by $0.9 million) and paid approximately $1.8 million in transaction costs. In June and August 2008, we paid to CryoCath contingent acquisition payments totaling $2.0 million due upon the successful transition of manufacturing operations from CryoCath to us. In June 2009, we made a $2.0 million acquisition payment to CryoCath due two years after the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for additional details regarding this acquisition. During 2009 we converted a long term restricted investment of $0.5 million to cash. During 2007 we invested $0.3 million for the purchase of patents, patent rights and other intellectual property. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for more information regarding these intangible asset purchases. Financing Activities Equity Financing. During 2009, we received $2.5 million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of a warrant on 1,000,000 shares of our common stock issued in connection with the December 2008 private placement discussed below. We also received net proceeds of approximately $0.3 million during 2009 from other issuances of common stock, primarily through purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During 2008, we raised $23.9 million from the issuance of our common stock, including $19.8 million received in connection with a December 2008 private placement sale of 8,510,639 shares of our common stock and issuance of warrants to purchase 2,533,192 shares of our common stock. The warrants are exercisable at $2.475 per share during the first year after the closing of the stock sale, $2.85 per share during the second year, and $3.10 thereafter. We also received $3.2 million upon the 2008 exercise of a warrant on 1,960,000 shares of our common stock issued in connection with the June 2007 private placement discussed below. We received net proceeds of approximately $0.8 million during 2008 from other issuances of common stock, primarily through exercises of stock options and warrants as well as purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. During 2007, we raised $30.6 million, net of offering costs, through two private placement sales of our common stock. The first, in March 2007, raised $15.3 million, net of offering costs, through the sale of 8,125,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.00 per share and warrants to purchase 3,250,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.40 per share. The second, in June 2007, raised $15.3 million, net of offering costs, through the sale of 9,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.65 per share and a seven year warrant to purchase up to 1,960,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.65 per share. We also received net proceeds of $0.7 million during 2007 from the issuance of common stock through exercises of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. Debt Financing. In June 2008, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Theodore C. Skokos, a member of our Board of Directors, for a two year, $5 million Credit Facility. Advances under the Credit Facility carry interest at 15% per annum payable quarterly. The Credit Facility also carries an annual commitment fee of 1% of the average unused Revolving Commitment Amount, payable annually. We paid the first annual commitment fee of $0.05 million to Mr. Skokos in July 2009. As of December 31, 2009, no amounts had been drawn under the Credit Facility. Our obligations to Mr. Skokos under the Credit Agreement are subordinate to (1) our obligations to the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes and (2) our obligations to Silicon Valley Bank. All assets are pledged as collateral on the Credit Facility. In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, we issued to Mr. Skokos a warrant to purchase 245,098 shares of our common stock at $2.04 per share until June 29, 2015. In July 2008, Mr. Skokos exercised this warrant in full and we received $0.5 million from the exercise. We are obligated to issue additional seven year warrants to Mr. Skokos in the future based on the total amount of advances under the Credit Facility. Since 2004 we have maintained a Loan and Security Agreement (Loan Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank. Under the Loan Agreement, as amended, all ATS assets are pledged as collateral and we are subject to certain financial covenants. In June 2007, we entered into an Amendment to the Loan Agreement whereby the Bank provided for an $8.6 million Term Loan, which we used to repay then outstanding term loans and advances from the Bank and to purchase the surgical cryoablation business from CryoCath. 39 Table of Contents Under the Term Loan, as amended, we made monthly payments of interest only from July 2007 through March 2008, and we began making monthly payments of principal plus interest effective April 2008 that continue until June 2011. Accordingly, we repaid $2.6. million and $2.0 million of principal on the Term Loan during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have the right to prepay all, but not less than all, of the outstanding Term Loan at any time so long as no event of default has occurred. Interest on the Term Loan accrues at a fixed rate per annum of 9.5%, equal to 1.25% above the Prime Rate in effect as of the funding date of the Term Loan. The June 2007 Amendment also made certain changes to the liquidity ratio covenant set forth in the Loan Agreement, as amended. The liquidity ratio was changed to require that we maintain, at all times, on a consolidated basis, a ratio of (1) the sum of (a) our unrestricted cash (and equivalents) on deposit with the Bank plus (b) 50% of the our accounts receivable arising from the sale or lease of goods, or provision of services, in the ordinary course of business, divided by (2) our indebtedness to the Bank for borrowed money, equal to or greater than 1.4 to 1.0. In June 2008, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Loan Agreement whereby, for the balance of 2008, the 1.4 to 1.0 required liquidity ratio was reduced to 1.1 to 1.0 for intra quarter months only. The liquidity ratio remained at 1.4 to 1.0 for quarter end months and reverted to 1.4 to 1.0 for all months beginning in 2009. In December 2008, we entered into an Amendment to the Loan Agreement whereby the liquidity ratio was raised to 2.0 to 1.0 until a $4.5 million litigation settlement payment was made to CarboMedics and a related security interest granted to CarboMedics was released. Upon such payment, the Bank agreed to return the liquidity ratio requirement to 1.4 to 1.0. In April 2009, we made the $4.5 million settlement payment. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement, as amended. In October 2005, we sold a combined $22.4 million aggregate principal amount of 6% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2025, warrants to purchase 1,344,000 shares of our common stock (Warrants) and certain embedded derivatives. The Warrants are exercisable at $4.40 per share and expire in 2010. We used the proceeds from the Convertible Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, working capital, capital expenditures and to fund business development opportunities. Interest on the Convertible Senior Notes is due semi annually in April and October. The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into common stock at any time at a fixed conversion price of $4.20 per share, subject to certain adjustments. If fully converted, the Convertible Senior Notes would convert into approximately 5,333,334 shares of our common stock. We have the right to redeem the Convertible Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest at any time on or after October 20, 2008, and the investors have the right to require us to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on October 15 in 2010, 2015 and 2020. Accordingly, we have reclassified the Convertible Senior Notes from long term to current liabilities on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009. On February 25, 2010, we received a commitment letter for four year (interest only first year) term debt financing of approximately $30 million from one of our directors, Theodore C. Skokos, and The Ted and Shannon Skokos Foundation. This financing will be used to call and retire the Convertible Senior Notes and bank Term Loan together totaling approximately $26 million as well as to provide general corporate working capital. We expect to close the financing during the second quarter of 2010. When the Notes are retired we expect to recognize a non cash debt restructuring charge of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million related primarily to the unamortized discount on the Notes. Cash Management and Funding of Future Operations We anticipate that operating costs will remain relatively high in comparison to sales during 2010 and will continue to require the use of cash to fund operations. Based upon the current forecast of sales and operating expenses, we anticipate having sufficient cash to fund our operations. However, we may need to raise additional cash in or after 2010 to fund our strategic investments, refinance long term obligations or to opportunistically add accretive products to our distribution network. As identified in Item 1A of this Form 10 K, global economic turmoil may adversely impact our revenue, access to the capital markets or future demand for our products, all of which could affect our long term viability. Approximately 60% of our revenue is derived from markets outside the United States and this revenue may be adversely impacted by large swings in foreign currency exchange rates and the availability of credit for our distributors in emerging markets. Maintaining adequate levels of working capital depends in part upon the success of our products in the marketplace, the relative profitability of those products and our ability to control operating and capital expenses. 40 Table of Contents Funding of our operations in future periods may require additional investments in ATS in the form of equity or debt. In addition, as discussed above, the holders of our $22.4 million Convertible Senior Notes have the option to require us to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes in October 2010. As discussed above, we have recently obtained a commitment for term debt financing which will be used to call and retire the Notes. However, if this financing is not consummated and the Note holders exercise their repurchase option, we would need to raise capital, issue debt securities and or borrow to finance the repurchase of these Notes.. Any sale of additional equity or issuance of debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities, which could harm the growth of our business. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements (as such term is defined in Item 303 of Regulation S K) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, operating results, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our future payment obligations (in thousands): Payments Due By Period Less More Than 1 3 3 5 Than 5 Total 1 year Years Years Years (2) Convertible Senior Notes payable (1) $ 43,904 $ 1,344 $ 4,032 $ 4,032 $ 34,496 Bank Term Loan payable (1) 4,319 2,943 1,376 Leases and other 1,902 851 979 72 Total $ 50,125 $ 5,138 $ 6,387 $ 4,104 $ 34,496 (1) Includes interest payments. (2) The holders of our Convertible Senior Notes have the option to require us to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes in October 2010. Therefore, the $22.4 million face amount of the Convertible Senior Notes has been classified on our balance sheet at December 31, 2009 as a current liability. Cautionary Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent, belief or current expectations of ATS and our management. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement. We desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions. Accordingly, we have identified in Item 1A of this Form 10 K important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents. We do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this Form 10 K to conform them to actual results. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair market value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments (if any) may be invested in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, and both government and non government debt securities. The average duration of our investments has generally been less than one year. Due to the short term nature of these investments, we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. In the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, we sell our products directly to hospitals. In other international markets, we sell our products to independent distributors who, in turn, sell to medical hospitals. Loss, termination, or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Transactions with U.S. and non U.S. customers and distributors, other than in our direct selling markets in Europe, are entered into in U.S. dollars, precluding the need for foreign currency hedges on such sales. Sales through our French, German and Belgian distribution subsidiaries are generally denominated in Euros. Sales to the United Kingdom and Switzerland are also made through our Belgian distribution company and are denominated in pounds and Swiss francs, respectively. Therefore, we are subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements. We have not used foreign exchange contracts or similar devices to reduce this risk. We will evaluate the need to use foreign exchange contracts or similar devices if sales in our European direct markets increase substantially.
