ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business We are engaged in providing pressure pumping services and other oilfield services to the oil and natural gas industry worldwide. Services are provided through four business segments: U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping, Canada Pressure Pumping, International Pressure Pumping and the Oilfield Services Group. The U.S./Mexico, Canada and International Pressure Pumping segments provide stimulation and cementing services to the petroleum industry throughout the world. Stimulation services are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing formations. Cementing services consists of pumping a cement slurry into a well between the casing and the wellbore to isolate fluids that might otherwise damage the casing and or affect productivity, or that could migrate to different zones, primarily during the drilling and completion phases of a well. See Business included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for more information on these operations. The Oilfield Services Group consists of casing and tubular services, process and pipeline services, chemical services, completion tools and completion fluids services in the United States and in select markets internationally. Baker Hughes Merger Agreement On August 30, 2009, we and Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which we will merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Baker Hughes, and each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.40035 shares of Baker Hughes common stock and $2.69 in cash (the Merger). Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) approval of the Merger by our stockholders, (ii) approval by the stockholders of Baker Hughes of the issuance of Baker Hughes common stock to execute the Merger, (iii) applicable regulatory approvals, including the termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iv) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S 4 relating to the Baker Hughes common stock to be issued in the Merger, and (v) other customary closing conditions. Under the Merger Agreement, we agreed to conduct our business in the ordinary course while the Merger is pending, and to generally refrain from acquiring new businesses, incurring new indebtedness, repurchasing treasury shares, issuing new common stock or equity awards, or entering into new material contracts or commitments outside the normal course of business, without the consent of Baker Hughes. Under certain circumstances, we or Baker Hughes may be required to pay a termination fee of $175 million to the other party if the Merger is not completed. When and if the Merger is approved or completed, certain contractual obligations of the Company will or may be triggered or accelerated under the change of control provisions of such contractual arrangements. Examples of such arrangements include stock based compensation awards, severance and retirement plan agreements applicable to executive officers, directors and certain employees, and the equipment partnership described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We and Baker Hughes are working to comply with the Department of Justices second request for additional information and documentary material issued October 14, 2009, and to complete the Merger as quickly as practicable, and we currently expect the Merger to be completed during our second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2010. However, we cannot predict with certainty when the Merger will be completed, because completion of the Merger is subject to conditions both within and beyond our control. Market Conditions Our worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of such wells, the number of well completions and the level of workover activity. Drilling and workover activity, in turn, is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas and the volatility and expectations of future oil and natural gas prices. Our results of operations also depend heavily on the pricing we receive from our customers, which depends on activity levels, availability of equipment and other resources, and competitive pressures. These market factors often lead to volatility in our revenue and profitability, especially in the United States and Canada, where we have historically generated in excess of 50% of our revenue. 23 Table of Contents Historical market conditions are reflected in the table below for our fiscal years ended September 30: 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Rig Count(1): U.S. 1,283 31 % 1,851 6 % 1,749 Canada 254 31 % 366 0 % 365 International(2) 1,017 4 % 1,061 7 % 989 Commodity Prices (average): Crude Oil (West Texas Intermediate) $ 57.28 47 % $ 107.64 67 % $ 64.62 Natural Gas (Henry Hub) $ 4.47 50 % $ 9.00 30 % $ 6.90 (1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Inc. rig count information. (2) Excludes Canada, and includes Mexico rig count of 124, 100 and 90 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively. U.S. Rig Count Demand for our pressure pumping services in the United States is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling activity, which tends to be extremely volatile, depending on the current and anticipated prices of crude oil and natural gas. During the last 11 years, the lowest annual U.S. rig count averaged 601 in fiscal 1999 and the highest annual U.S. rig count averaged 1,851 in fiscal 2008. With the retraction of oil and natural gas prices since their peak in July 2008, tightening and uncertainty in the credit markets, and the global economic slowdown, drilling activity in the United States has rapidly declined from peak levels of 2,031 rigs at September 12, 2008 to a recent low of 876 rigs at June 12, 2009 before gradually improving during our fiscal fourth quarter. U.S. rig count was 1,024 rigs at October 2, 2009. The near term and longer range outlook for U.S. drilling activity is uncertain, and will ultimately be influenced by a number of factors, including commodity prices, global demand for oil and natural gas, production and depletion rates of oil and natural gas reserves, and government policy with respect to the financial credit crisis, energy and environmental issues, and other issues impacting our business. Canadian Rig Count The demand for our pressure pumping services in Canada is primarily driven by oil and natural gas drilling activity and, similar to the United States, tends to be extremely volatile. During the last 11 years, the lowest annual rig count averaged 212 in fiscal 1999 and the highest annual rig count averaged 502 in fiscal 2006. Similar to activity in the United States, drilling rig activity in Canada has declined significantly since late September 2008. Rig count in Canada typically encounters significant seasonal fluctuations, decreasing during the spring break up period when snow and ice begin to melt and heavy equipment is not permitted on the roads, restricting access to well sites and, therefore, resulting in lower drilling activity. The spring break up period typically begins in late February or March and extends through May. Drilling activity in Canada was generally slow to resume after spring break up in fiscal 2009 due to adverse market conditions. At October 2, 2009, the Canadian drilling rig count was 238 rigs. International Rig Count Many countries in which we operate are subject to political, social and economic risks which may cause volatility within any given country. However, our international revenue in total is less volatile because we operate in approximately 50 countries, which helps to offset exposure to any one country. Due to the significant investment and complexity of international projects, we believe drilling decisions relating to such projects tend to be evaluated and monitored with a longer term perspective with regard to oil and natural gas pricing. Additionally, the international market is dominated by major oil companies and national oil companies which tend to have different objectives and more operating stability than the typical independent producer in North America. During the last 11 years, the lowest annual international rig count, excluding Canada and including Mexico, averaged 616 in fiscal 1999 and the highest annual international rig count averaged 1,061 in fiscal 2008. International rig count declined during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, but at a much lower rate than North America. In response to prevailing market conditions, we have implemented a number of cost reduction measures in the United States, Canada and certain markets outside of North America. Such measures include reducing personnel levels, managing our supply chain to reduce material costs, reducing capital spending and controlling our investment in working capital. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated (dollars in millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenue $ 4,121.9 23 % $ 5,359.1 13 % $ 4,730.5 Operating income 229.3 75 % 913.3 21 % 1,152.6 Operating income margin 5.6 % 17.0 % 24.4 % Worldwide rig count(1) 2,554 22 % 3,278 6 % 3,103 (1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Inc. rig count information. Results for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009, the impact of the global economic downturn and decreased demand for oil and natural gas, combined with intense price competition in North America negatively affected each of our reporting segments compared to the prior year. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased 23% compared to fiscal 2008, and consolidated operating income decreased 75%, primarily as a result of decreased demand and intense price competition for our products and services, most notably in the United States and Canada. Results for fiscal 2009 included unusual charges, including a non cash charge of $21.7 million related to the settlement of a U.S. defined benefit pension plan, employee severance costs of $11.1 million, $15.4 million in non cash charges related to excess or idle fixed assets, $10.0 million of non cash inventory write downs, and $5.3 million of costs related to the pending Merger with Baker Hughes. These unusual charges during fiscal 2009 represented 1.5% of consolidated revenue. For fiscal 2009, consolidated operating income margin decreased to 6% from 17% in fiscal 2008. Results for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 13% compared to fiscal 2007, with all of our reportable segments showing sequential revenue growth. Revenue from U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping Services increased 8% from fiscal 2007 as a result of higher activity levels largely offset by lower pricing for our products and services. Revenue from our Canada and International Pressure Pumping Services increased 14% and 18%, respectively. The Canadian increase was primarily attributable to favorable exchange rates and the International increase was the result of increased activity in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America. During 2008, our Oilfield Services Groups revenue increased 22%, largely as a result of increased international activity and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Innicor Subsurface Technologies Inc. in May 2008. Despite improved revenue from all of our reportable segments, consolidated operating income margin declined from 24% in fiscal 2007 to 17% in fiscal 2008. Declining prices for our products and services in the North American market as well as increased material and fuel costs led to the overall decline in operating income margin. See discussion below on individual reporting segments for further revenue and operating income variance details. U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping Segment (dollars in millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenue $ 1,853.8 32 % $ 2,743.4 8 % $ 2,534.6 Operating income 104.1 83 % 597.8 32 % 874.8 Operating income margin 5.6 % 21.8 % 34.5 % U.S. rig count(1) 1,283 31 % 1,851 6 % 1,749 Mexico rig count(1) 124 24 % 100 11 % 90 Total U.S. / Mexico rig count 1,407 28 % 1,951 6 % 1,839 (1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Inc. rig count information. 25 Table of Contents Results for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 revenue for our U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping segment decreased 32% with average active drilling rigs for the U.S. and Mexico decreasing 28% when compared to fiscal 2008. This revenue decrease was primarily the result of lower pricing and decreased demand for our products and services within the U.S. market, partially offset by increased activity in Mexico. U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping operating income margin decreased from 22% in fiscal 2008 to 6% for fiscal 2009 as increased competition in the United States resulted in lower pricing for our products and services. The results for fiscal 2009 also include $13.9 million of non cash charges related to excess or idle fixed assets, $4.7 million in inventory charges and $5.1 in employee severance costs. Results for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 revenue for our U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping segment increased 8% compared to fiscal 2007, with average active drilling rigs increasing 6%. All of the operating regions within our U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping segment, except the Gulf Coast, showed improved revenue from fiscal 2007. While U.S. activity increased for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, the prices we received for our products and services declined. U.S./Mexico Pressure Pumping operating income margin decreased from 35% in fiscal 2007 to 22% for fiscal 2008. A decline in prices coupled with increased material, maintenance and fuel costs caused the fiscal 2008 operating income margin decline. Canada Pressure Pumping Segment (dollars in millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenue $ 309.4 30 % $ 442.5 14 % $ 386.5 Operating income 17.6 49 % 34.3 6 % 32.5 Operating income margin 5.7 % 7.8 % 8.4 % Canada rig count(1) 254 31 % 366 0 % 365 (1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Inc. rig count information. Results for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 Canadian Pressure Pumping revenue decreased $133.1 million, or 30%, for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Average drilling rig count in Canada was down 31% for the comparable periods. The weaker Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar during the comparable periods accounts for approximately $57.8 million of the revenue decrease. In addition, decreased demand and lower pricing during the second half of fiscal 2009 negatively impacted revenue for the comparable periods. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the average Canadian dollar exchange rate decreased 17% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, thereby decreasing the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues earned in Canada. Operating income margin for fiscal 2009 declined to 6% compared to 8% for fiscal 2008. Decreased drilling activity and increased pricing pressures in fiscal 2009 contributed to the operating margin decline. Results for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 The 14% increase in revenue for Canada Pressure Pumping for fiscal 2008 was almost entirely due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the average Canadian dollar exchange rate increased 9% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, thereby increasing the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues earned in Canada. Activity levels had little impact on the revenue increase, as the Canadian average active drilling rigs for fiscal 2008 remained unchanged from the prior year. Operating income margin for fiscal 2008 was 8%, consistent with fiscal 2007. Despite improved revenues, the region operating income margin was negatively impacted by increased pricing pressures and cost increases in fiscal 2008. 26 Table of Contents International Pressure Pumping Segment (dollars in millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenue $ 1,098.5 7 % $ 1,185.4 18 % $ 1,002.8 Operating income 121.5 32 % 178.7 15 % 154.8 Operating income margin 11.1 % 15.1 % 15.4 % International rig count(1) 893 7 % 961 7 % 899 (1) Estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on Baker Hughes Inc. rig count information, excluding Canada and Mexico. Our International Pressure Pumping segment has four operating segments. Our Europe segment includes the North Sea, continental Europe, Nigeria and the West Africa coastal area north of Nigeria. Our Middle East segment includes the Arab countries, India, Central Asia and North Africa, including Algeria, Libya and Egypt. Our Latin America segment includes South America, Central America, and West Africa countries south of Nigeria, including Angola and Gabon. We completed our contractual obligations and shut down our pressure pumping operation in Russia during fiscal 2009; consequently, our Russia pressure pumping operations are now classified as discontinued operations. Results for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 The following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the International Pressure Pumping reportable segment, comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008: % change inRevenue Europe 14 % Middle East 11 % Asia Pacific 2 % Latin America 6 % International Pressure Pumping revenue of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2009 decreased 7% compared to fiscal 2008, consistent with the 7% decline in average international drilling rig activity. The increased revenue in Asia Pacific is largely attributable to increased activity in Malaysia and Thailand, offset by lower activity in China and New Zealand. The decline in Latin America revenue was largely the result of industry wide labor strikes in Argentina during much of the second half of fiscal 2009, partially offset by activity related increases in Brazil. In the Middle East, the favorable impact of increased activity and new service contracts in North Africa was more than offset by lower rig activity in Saudi Arabia, India and Kazakhstan. Revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2009 largely as a result of unfavorable exchange rates primarily in early fiscal 2009, which caused local currency billings to translate into fewer U.S. dollars, combined with lower activity and lower pricing in the North Sea. Operating income margin from our International Pressure Pumping operations decreased from 15% in fiscal 2008 to 11% in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of lower volume of activity and lower pricing in certain countries within the Middle East and Latin America regions. Fiscal 2009 results in the International Pressure Pumping segment included severance costs totaling $2.4 million associated with our initiative to align our workforce with current market conditions, a $4.2 million charge related to a denied value added tax refund claim in the Asia Pacific, charges of $4.5 million for unfavorable outcomes of a tax court ruling and a customer dispute, and $1.5 million of fixed asset impairment charges. Results for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 The following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the International Pressure Pumping reportable segment, comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007: % change inRevenue Europe 11 % Middle East 27 % Asia Pacific 15 % Latin America 28 % 27 Table of Contents International Pressure Pumping revenue increased 18% for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Increased activity in our Middle East and Latin American operations primarily accounted for the overall revenue increase. Our Middle East operations benefited from the introduction of two stimulation vessels into the India market as well as improved revenues from Algeria and activity increases in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Our Latin American operations experienced significant growth in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and in Gabon when comparing fiscal 2008 revenue to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of increased drilling and completion activity in those countries. Average active drilling rigs in the region increased 6% when compared to the prior year. In Asia Pacific, revenue increased 15% with average active drilling rigs in the region increasing 11%. Most major markets within the region experienced revenue growth. Declines in revenue from our offshore stimulation vessel in the North Sea due to its relocation to India, as well as a revenue decline from our Northern West Africa operations caused the 11% decrease in revenue for Europe for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Operating income margin remained consistent with fiscal 2007 at 15%, with declines in revenue from our Asia Pacific operations offsetting positive contribution to operating income from our other operating regions. Oilfield Services Group (dollars in millions) 2009 % Change 2008 % Change 2007 Revenue $ 860.1 13 % $ 987.8 22 % $ 806.5 Operating income 102.9 46 % 191.7 13 % 170.4 Operating income margin 12.0 % 19.4 % 21.1 % Results for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 The following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the Oilfield Services Group, comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008: % Change inRevenue Tubular Services 18 % Process & Pipeline Services 16 % Chemical Services 6 % Completion Tools 9 % Completion Fluids 11 % Revenues from our Oilfield Services Group decreased 13% to $860.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, while worldwide average drilling rig count declined 22%. Tubular Services declined primarily as a result of lower service activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Asia Pacific. Process & Pipeline Services revenue declined as a result of decreased activity in North America and the conclusion of several large international projects in fiscal 2008. Chemical Services revenue declined at a lower rate than other Oilfield Services businesses, as increased capillary work in the United States and internationally substantially offset the revenue impact of lower drilling and completion activity in North America. Completion Tools revenue declined as a result of lower activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and lower international sales, the impact of which was somewhat offset by the inclusion of a full year contribution from the Innicor Subsurface Technologies business, which was acquired in May 2008. Completion Fluids revenue decreased primarily as a result of lower activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by new contract work in Mexico. Operating income margin for the Oilfield Services Group in fiscal 2009 declined to 12% from 19% in the prior year, primarily as a result of lower activity and, to a lesser extent, lower pricing and an unfavorable product/service mix. 28 Table of Contents Results for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 The following table summarizes the percentage change in revenue for each of the operating segments within the Oilfield Services Group, comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007: % Change inRevenue Tubular Services 11 % Process & Pipeline Services 37 % Chemical Services 31 % Completion Tools 38 % Completion Fluids 18 % All of the operating segments within our Oilfield Services Group except Completion Fluids, which was negatively impacted by a decline in offshore deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico, showed improved revenues for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Process & Pipeline Services benefited from increased international and U.S. activity, while Chemical Services benefited primarily from increased revenue from capillary services and increased U.S. activity levels. In May 2008, we acquired Innicor Subsurface Technologies Inc. This acquisition along with increased project oriented sales in international markets accounted for our Completion Tools revenue improvement. Excluding the effect of the Innicor acquisition, Completion Tools revenue improved 27%. Tubular Services also showed improved revenue as a result of increased activity in international markets. Operating income margin for the Oilfield Services Group in fiscal 2008 declined to 19% from 21% in fiscal 2007. Positive contributions from our Process & Pipeline Services, Chemical Services and Tubular Services groups were offset by declining operating income margins from our Completion Tools and Completion Fluids operating segments within the Oilfield Services Group. Other Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our other operating expenses (dollars in millions): 2009 % ofRevenue 2008 % ofRevenue 2007 % ofRevenue Research and engineering $ 66.3 1.6 % $ 72.0 1.3 % $ 67.5 1.4 % Marketing 108.2 2.6 % 120.7 2.3 % 107.1 2.2 % General and administrative 159.1 3.9 % 159.0 3.0 % 142.1 3.0 % Loss on disposal of assets, net 13.5 0.3 % 2.9 0.1 % 0.0 0.0 % Pension settlement 21.7 0.5 % Research and engineering: Research and engineering expense decreased $5.7 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of cost reductions implemented during 2009 in response to prevailing market conditions. As a percentage of revenue, research and engineering expense increased slightly to 1.6% in fiscal 2009 compared to 1.3% in fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the lower revenue base in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, research and engineering expense increased $4.5 million, or 7%, from fiscal 2007, primarily due to increased personnel costs. As a percentage of revenue, research and engineering expense decreased to 1.3% in fiscal 2008 compared to 1.4% in fiscal 2007. Marketing: Marketing expense decreased $12.5 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of cost reductions implemented during 2009 in response to prevailing market conditions. As a percentage of revenue, marketing expense increased to 2.6% in fiscal 2009 compared to 2.3% in fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the lower revenue base in fiscal 2009. An increase in personnel costs was the main contributor to the $13.5 million, or 13%, increase in marketing expense from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. As a percentage of revenue, fiscal 2008 marketing expense increased slightly to 2.3% compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2007. 29 Table of Contents General and administrative: General and administrative expense remained flat at $159.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting the impact of cost reduction measures introduced in 2009 offset by costs related to the pending Baker Hughes Merger, increased stock based compensation expense and other expenses incurred in 2009. We incurred $5.3 million of costs related to the Merger in our Corporate segment in fiscal 2009, primarily including investment banking fees and outside legal fees associated with the merger agreement, the regulatory approval process, and the stockholder litigation discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense was 3.9% in fiscal 2009, compared to 3.0% in fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the lower revenue base in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, general and administrative expense increased $16.8 million, or 12%, compared to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and depreciation expense. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expense was 3.0 % in fiscal 2008, consistent with fiscal 2007. Loss on disposal of assets, net: Loss on disposal of assets, net of gains, increased significantly in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of non cash fixed asset impairment charges totaling $7.2 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009. These charges related to certain cementing and stimulation equipment that was not economical to repair or maintain in the current market environment. Pension settlement: In September 2006, we entered into an agreement with an insurance company to settle our obligation with respect to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Plan assets of approximately $72 million were used to purchase an insurance contract to fund the benefits and settle the plan. In December 2008, we received approval from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service and were relieved of primary responsibility for the pension benefit obligation. Consequently, we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of $21.7 million in connection with the settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in our Corporate segment. Interest Expense and Interest Income: The following table shows a comparison of interest expense and interest income (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ (27.2 ) $ (28.1 ) $ (32.7 ) Interest income 1.2 1.9 1.6 Net interest expense $ (26.0 ) $ (26.2 ) $ (31.1 ) Interest expense decreased $0.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, and decreased $4.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. These decreases in interest expense are primarily attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings when comparing the respective periods. Outstanding debt balances decreased from $671.0 million at September 30, 2007 to $556.3 million at September 30, 2008 and to $506.1 million at September 30, 2009. Interest income decreased $0.7 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of lower prevailing interest rates in invested cash balances, despite significantly higher average cash and cash equivalents balance throughout fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 interest income increased slightly compared to fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of higher average invested cash balances. Other Expense, net: Other expense, net of other income, for the fiscal years ended September 30 is summarized as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Minority interest $ (13.8 ) $ (11.9 ) $ (11.3 ) Non operating net foreign exchange gain (loss) 0.7 (0.3 ) 0.1 (Loss) gain from sale of equity method investments (2.9 ) 0.5 Legal settlements 3.6 4.0 Other, net 0.4 2.5 3.1 Other expense, net $ (9.1 ) $ (8.6 ) $ (7.6 ) The increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 relates to increased minority interest as a result of improved operating results from our international joint venture operations, partially offset by a fiscal 2008 loss on the sale of our Hungarian joint venture not repeating in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, we recorded a $2.9 million loss on the sale of our interest in a Hungarian joint venture operation, and we received a $4.0 million cash settlement in a litigation matter. For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Primarily as a result of lower profit in our North American operations, and the resulting change in the geographic mix of our pre tax income in fiscal 2009, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 decreased to 14.5% of pre tax income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, compared to 29.4% in fiscal 2008. We earned profits in relatively low tax jurisdictions outside of North America, and recorded significant pre tax losses in the relatively high tax jurisdictions of the United States and Canada. The U.S. losses can be carried back to offset taxes paid in previous years. Our effective tax rate decreased from 32.3% in fiscal 2007 to 29.4% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the effect of a statutory tax rate decrease in Canada, a greater percentage of income earned in international tax jurisdictions, and an increase in the domestic production activity deduction (Section 199 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) in fiscal 2008. Discontinued Operations We completed work on our final pressure pumping contract in Russia in July 2009. Consequently, we classified the Russia pressure pumping unit, an operating segment within the International Pumping Services segment, as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this business, along with its historical results of operations, have been reclassified for all periods presented. As soon as our contractual obligations were fulfilled, we began the process of redeployment and liquidation of the assets associated with this business and other exit activities. We recorded charges totaling $6.6 million in connection with these exit activities, including employee separation costs, fixed asset and inventory impairment charges. We expect to incur additional exit costs during fiscal 2010 in the range of $34 million as we complete the exit activities associated with our Russia pressure pumping business. Summarized operating results from discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Revenue $ 30.0 $ 67.2 $ 71.9 Loss before income taxes (16.2 ) (10.4 ) (1.0 ) Income tax expense (benefit) (0.2 ) 0.7 (0.8 ) Loss from discontinued operations $ (16.0 ) $ (11.1 ) $ (0.2 ) Loss from discontinued operations increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of the completion of our contractual service obligations, and subsequent exit activities related to our Russia pressure pumping operations. Fiscal 2009 results included $2.7 million of inventory impairment, $2.8 million of fixed asset impairment and $1.1 million of employee termination costs. Fiscal 2008 included a $6.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Russia pressure pumping operations. We recognized this goodwill impairment charge when our analysis indicated that all goodwill associated with that business would not likely be recoverable, as a result of competitive pressure in the areas in which we operate, cost inflation, currency risks and concerns over future activity reductions. Income tax expense related to discontinued operations was minimal for the three year period ending September 30, 3009, due to accumulated operating losses in Russia for which no benefit was realizable. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow The following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended September 30 (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by operations $ 654.1 $ 898.8 $ 840.7 Cash used in investing (386.3 ) (648.1 ) (777.9 ) Cash used in financing (139.1 ) (153.8 ) (98.0 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3.7 (4.8 ) 1.0 Change in cash and cash equivalents $ 132.4 $ 92.1 $ (34.2 ) Fiscal 2009 Cash flow from operating activities of $654.1 million in fiscal 2009 decreased $244.7 million, or 27%, compared to the $898.8 million of cash provided from operations in fiscal 2008. Net income from continuing operations of $166.0 million in fiscal 2009 was $454.5 million lower than in fiscal 2008 and $587.8 million lower than fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the market downturn and corresponding lower demand for our services and products. Non cash items included in net income, primarily including depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, pension settlement, net loss on disposal or impairment of assets, bad debt reserves and deferred income taxes, totaled $438.6 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $379.7 million in fiscal 2008 and $276.7 million in fiscal 2007. Changes in working capital and other operating accounts generated cash of $27.2 million in fiscal 2009, compared to using cash of $99.6 million in fiscal 2008 and $195.2 million in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of the decline in market activity which led to reductions in working capital. Cash used in investing decreased $261.8 million, or 40%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting a decrease in capital expenditures, primarily as a result of lower expansion capital needed due to lower demand for our products and services. Cash used in financing activities decreased $14.7 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of higher debt repayments during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2009, partially offset by a treasury stock purchase of $44.2 million in fiscal 2009. In addition to the treasury stock purchase, financing activities in fiscal 2009 primarily consisted of $50.4 million, net, in payments of short term borrowings and $58.5 million in dividend payments. We also received net proceeds in the amount of $16.7 million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 Cash flow from operations of $898.8 million in fiscal 2008 increased $58.1 million, or 7%, compared to the $840.7 million of cash provided from operations in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of lower investment in inventories between the two periods. Net cash flows before changes in operating accounts were $1,000.2 million in fiscal 2008 compared to $1,030.5 million in fiscal 2007, with the decrease primarily attributable to lower U.S./Mexico pressure pumping operating income. Changes in operating accounts accounted for $99.6 million of cash usage in fiscal 2008, compared to $195.2 million usage in fiscal 2007. This improvement was primarily attributable to the stable inventory levels, compared to significant increases in inventory in fiscal 2007. Increased receivables accounted for a $124.1 million use of cash, primarily as a result of increased revenues, particularly internationally. The cash flow used in investing during the fiscal 2008 was almost entirely due to $605.6 million of purchases of property, plant, and equipment and $57.2 million for the acquisition of businesses, principally Innicor Subsurface Technologies Inc. in May 2008. Cash flows used in financing consisted of $113.7 million, net, in payments of short term borrowings and $58.6 million in dividend payments during fiscal 2008. We also received net proceeds in the amount of $14.2 million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal 2008. Further investing activities during the period included the issuance of 6% Senior Notes due 2018 for $246.9 million in net proceeds in May 2008 and the repayment of $250.0 million of Senior Notes in June 2008. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 was $840.7 million. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2007 included increased inventory in anticipation of increases in activity, increased accounts receivable as a result of increased revenue and days sales outstanding, and increased prepaid expenses primarily related to tax payments. Increased accounts payable also contributed to cash flow from operations, mostly from increased activity levels. The cash flow used in investing during fiscal 2007 was almost entirely due to $741.8 million of purchases of property, plant, and equipment, including $47.8 million paid to buy out an equipment partnership established in 1997. We also paid $57.9 million, net of cash, for acquisitions. Cash flows used in financing consisted of $11.0 million, net, in proceeds from short term borrowings, $74.6 million in repurchases of our common stock and $58.6 million of dividend payments during fiscal 2007. We also received proceeds in the amount of $22.4 million from employee stock purchases and stock option exercises during fiscal 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents balance of $282.6 million at September 30, 2009 and cash flows from operations are expected to be our primary source of liquidity in fiscal 2010. Our sources of liquidity also include the available financing facilities listed below (in millions): Financing Facility Expiration Borrowings atSeptember 30, 2009 Available atSeptember 30, 2009 Revolving Credit Facility August 2012 $ $ 400.0 Discretionary Various times within the next 12 months 7.2 24.3 On May 19, 2008, we completed a public offering of $250.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2018. The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $246.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, were used to retire $250.0 million in outstanding floating rate Senior Notes, which matured June 1, 2008. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $249.9 million of the 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011 and $249.0 million of the 6% Senior Notes due 2018 issued and outstanding, net of discount. Our amended and restated revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) permits borrowings of up to $400 million in principal amount. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $50 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Swingline loans have short term maturities and the remaining amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility become due and payable in August 2012. In addition, we have the right to request up to an additional $200 million over the permitted borrowings of $400 million, subject to the approval of our lenders at the time of the request. Depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding under this facility, the interest rate applicable to borrowings generally ranges from 30 40 basis points above LIBOR. We are charged various fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including a commitment fee based on the average daily unused portion of the commitment, totaling $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility charges a utilization fee on all outstanding loans and letters of credit when usage of the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 62.5%; there were no material utilization fees incurred in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2009 or 2008, and pursuant to the Merger Agreement, their must be no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the completion date of the Merger. In May 2008, we entered into a Committed Credit Facility with a commercial bank to finance our acquisition of Innicor Subsurface Technologies Inc. There were no commitment fees required by this facility, and the interest rate was based on market rates on the dates that amounts are borrowed. This facility expired in May 2009 and was repaid with cash on hand. In addition to the Revolving Credit Facility, we had available $24.3 million of unsecured discretionary lines of credit at September 30, 2009, which expire at the banks discretion. There are no requirements for commitment fees or compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit, and interest is at prevailing market rates. There was $7.2 million, $7.6 million and $24.3 million in outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 4.50%, 5.23% and 5.40%, respectively. 33 Table of Contents Management believes that cash flows from operations combined with cash and cash equivalents, the Revolving Credit Facility and other discretionary credit facilities provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our routine operations, meet debt service obligations, fund projected capital expenditures, pay a regular quarterly dividend and support the development of our short term and long term operating strategies. If the discretionary lines of credit are not renewed, or if borrowings under these lines of credit otherwise become unavailable, we expect to refinance this debt by arranging additional committed bank facilities or through other long term borrowing alternatives. The Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility include various customary covenants and other provisions, including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios, none of which materially restrict our activities. We are currently in compliance with all covenants imposed. Cash Requirements We anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately $170 200 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $394.2 million in fiscal 2009. The actual amount of fiscal 2010 capital expenditures will depend primarily on maintenance capital requirements, expansion opportunities and our ability to execute our budgeted capital expenditures. In fiscal 2010, our minimum pension and postretirement funding requirements are anticipated to be approximately $15.0 million. We funded $13.4 million to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal 2009. We paid cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 per common share on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2009, totaling $58.5 million. We anticipate paying a quarterly dividend in fiscal 2010 until the Merger is completed; however, dividends are subject to approval of our Board of Directors each quarter and the Board has the ability to change the dividend policy at any time. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had $249.9 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011 and $249.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2018 issued and outstanding, net of discount. We expect cash paid for interest expense to be approximately $30 million in fiscal 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Transactions The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of September 30, 2009 (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3Years 3 5Years After 5Years Long term and short term debt $ 507.2 $ 7.2 $ 250.0 $ $ 250.0 Interest on long term debt and capital leases 163.8 29.4 44.4 30.0 60.0 Capital lease obligations 3.3 1.7 1.6 Operating leases 176.1 54.4 76.5 25.8 19.4 Equipment financing arrangement(1) 45.9 42.1 3.8 Purchase obligations(2) 99.6 99.6 Purchase commitments(3) 180.6 79.4 70.7 30.5 Other long term liabilities(4) 26.1 19.2 0.2 0.2 6.5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,202.6 $ 333.0 $ 447.2 $ 86.5 $ 335.9 (1) As discussed below, we have notified the partner of our intent to exercise our option to purchase the pumping service equipment in this partnership for approximately $46 million in 2010. We have, therefore, included the option payment in the table above. (2) Includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have been approved and that specify all significant terms (pricing, quantity and timing). (3) We have entered into agreements with certain suppliers to ensure that certain levels of fracturing materials are maintained in the United States and Canada. (4) Includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheet where the amounts and timing of the payment are known. Amounts include: Asset retirement obligations, known pension funding requirements, post retirement benefit obligation, environmental accruals and other miscellaneous long term obligations. Amounts exclude: Pension obligations in which funding requirements are uncertain and long term contingent liabilities. 34 Table of Contents On October 1, 2007, we adopted the guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes, addressing the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. However, the timing of future cash flows associated with ASC 740 is uncertain and we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, we excluded $50.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table. We expect that cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash flows to fund all of the cash requirements described above. In 1999, we contributed certain pumping service equipment to a limited partnership, in which we own a 1% interest. The equipment is used to provide services to our customers for which we pay a service fee over a period of at least six years, but not more than 13 years, at approximately $12 million annually. This is accounted for as an operating lease. We assessed the terms of this agreement and determined it was a variable interest entity. However, we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and therefore, consolidation was not required. The transaction resulted in a gain that is being deferred and amortized over the partnership term. The partnership agreement permits substitution of equipment within the partnership as long as the implied fair value of the new property transferred in at the date of substitution equals or exceeds the implied fair value, as defined, of the current property in the partnership that is being replaced. Substitution activity during the partnership term has reduced the balance of the deferred gain to zero at September 30, 2009, compared to $4.2 million at September 30, 2008. In 2010, we have the option to purchase the pumping service equipment for approximately $46 million, and we have notified the partner of our intent to do so. We routinely issue Parent Company Guarantees (PCGs) in connection with service contracts or performance obligations entered into by our subsidiaries. The issuance of these PCGs is frequently a condition of the bidding process imposed by our customers for work in countries outside of North America. The PCGs typically provide that we guarantee the performance of the services by our local subsidiary. The term of these PCGs varies with the length of the service contract. To date, the parent company has not been called upon to perform under any of these PCGs. We arrange for the issuance of a variety of bank guarantees, performance bonds and standby letters of credit. The vast majority of these are issued in connection with contracts we or our subsidiaries have entered into with customers. The customer has the right to call on the bank guarantee, performance bond or standby letter of credit in the event that we, or our subsidiaries, default in the performance of services. These instruments are required as a condition to being awarded the contract, and are typically released upon completion of the contract. We have also issued standby letters of credit in connection with a variety of our financial obligations, such as in support of fronted insurance programs, claims administration funding, certain employee benefit plans and temporary importation bonds. The following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of September 30, 2009 (in millions): Other Commercial Commitments Amount of commitment expiration per period TotalAmountsCommitted Less than1 Year 13Years 35Years Over 5Years Standby letters of credit $ 35.0 $ 34.8 $ 0.2 $ $ Guarantees 291.0 156.0 77.2 48.9 8.9 Total other commercial commitments $ 326.0 $ 190.8 $ 77.4 $ 48.9 $ 8.9 Investigations Regarding Misappropriation and Possible Illegal Payments We have had discussions with the DOJ and the SEC regarding our internal investigation and certain other matters described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is not possible to accurately predict at this time when any of these matters will be resolved. Based on current information, we cannot predict the outcome of such investigations, whether we will reach resolution through such discussions or what, if any, actions may be taken by the DOJ, the SEC or other authorities or the effect the foregoing may have on our consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies For an accounting policy to be deemed critical, the accounting policy must (i) have a potentially material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations and (ii) require us to make estimates based on historical experience or assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including estimates not deemed critical. We believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies. The selection of accounting estimates, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill: We account for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. ASC 350 requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis, or if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value, no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value, the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment, if any. Fair value measures include quoted market price, present value technique (estimate of future cash flows), and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue. The second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining fair value and the implied fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge. Our estimate of fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows. This approach uses significant assumptions such as a discount rate, growth rate, terminal value multiples, and future rig count and pricing trends. During fiscal 2008 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 million related to our Russia operations. With the competitive pressure in the areas in which we operate in Russia, cost inflation, currency risks and concerns over future activity reductions, our analysis indicated that our goodwill associated with Russia would not likely be recoverable. During fiscal 2009, we reviewed our goodwill balance for possible impairment and determined that no impairment existed. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on goodwill. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans: Pension expense and postretirement benefit obligation are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. We determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis. In determining the annual estimate of net periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical assumptions such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return on plan assets and expected increase in compensation levels. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions. Discount rates are based on high quality corporate fixed income investments. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate we used in fiscal 2009 would have resulted in the recognition of approximately $1.4 million in additional expense. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation and average annual returns being earned by similar investments. A 50 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return on assets of our plans would have resulted in the recognition of approximately $0.7 million in additional expense in fiscal 2009. 36 Table of Contents The rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon our historical salary experience. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Our postretirement medical benefit plan provides credits based on years of service that can be used to purchase coverage under the retiree plan. This plan effectively caps our health care inflation rate at a 4% increase per year. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would not have a material impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the net periodic postretirement benefit cost because these benefits are capped pursuant to the terms of the plan. In accordance with ASC 715, any changes in our assumptions or differences between estimated and actual return on plan assets and compensation levels result in unrecognized gain/loss which is recorded as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension expense in future periods. In fiscal 2010, we will have a pension and postretirement funding requirement of approximately $15.0 million. We expect to fund this amount with cash flows from operating activities. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension plans. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rates applicable to continuing operations were 14.5%, 29.4% and 32.3% for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These rates vary primarily due to fluctuations in taxes from the mix of domestic versus foreign income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the Company. In providing for deferred taxes, we consider current tax laws, estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. This process also involves making forecasts of current and future years U.S. taxable income. Unforeseen events and industry conditions may impact these forecasts which in turn can affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and impact our future reported earnings. Our tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. Resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty; accordingly, we provide taxes only for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings. In addition to the aforementioned assessments that have been received from various taxing authorities, we provide for taxes in certain situations where assessments have not been received. In those situations, we accrue income taxes where we consider it probable that the taxes ultimately payable will exceed those amounts reflected in filed tax returns; accordingly, taxes are provided in those situations under the guidance in ASC 740. Self Insurance Accruals and Loss Contingencies: We are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation, general liability, property damage and employee medical benefits for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported. We review the liability on a quarterly basis. The liability is based primarily on an actuarial undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience; however, the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer. This estimate is subject to trends, such as loss development factors, historical average claim volume, average cost for settled claims and current trends in claim costs. Significant and unanticipated changes in these trends or future actual payouts could result in additional increases or decreases to the recorded accruals. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit, to the extent feasible, our aggregate exposure to certain claims. There is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences. As discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against the Company. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the Company and litigation is subject to many uncertainties. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in these cases. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. While we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate, if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss, our results of operations may be positively or negatively impacted. 37 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance contained in ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, establishing an authoritative United States GAAP superseding all pre existing accounting standards and literature. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods after September 15, 2009. Consequently, we have changed the accounting literature references contained in this report, but other than that, this new standard had no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810, Consolidation Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the addition of qualified special purpose entities into previous guidance as the concept of these entities was eliminated by guidance under ASC 860. This guidance also modifies the analysis by which a controlling interest of a variable interest entity is determined thereby requiring the controlling interest to consolidate the variable interest entity. A controlling interest exists if a party to a variable interest entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity. This statement could impact the way we account for our limited partnership discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Lease and Other Long Term Commitments. ASC 810 becomes effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009 and should be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods during that period going forward. We will adopt the guidance under ASC 810 on October 1, 2010, and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, which eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity and enhances guidance related to derecognition of transferred assets. ASC 860 becomes effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15, 2009 and should be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods during that period going forward. We will adopt the guidance under ASC 860 on October 1, 2010, and have not yet determined the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. On June 30, 2009, we adopted guidance under ASC 825, Financial Instruments Overall, requiring publicly traded companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments in their interim financial statements. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for such disclosure. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 855, Subsequent Events, to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. We adopted this guidance beginning with our June 30, 2009 condensed consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits Defined Benefit Plans, requiring the disclosure of major categories of plan assets, investment policies and strategies, fair value measurement of plan assets and significant concentration of credit risks related to defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 and, accordingly, we will adopt it in fiscal 2010. In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance contained in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Others General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under previously existing literature. The objective of this guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 350 is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2009, and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, changing the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC 815, and its related interpretations, and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. We adopted this guidance in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We currently have no derivative financial instruments subject to accounting or disclosure under ASC 815; therefore, the guidance under ASC 815 had no effect on our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 805, Business Combinations, that retains fundamental requirements requiring the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. ASC 805 defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: a. Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. b. Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase. c. Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This guidance is effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. Consequently, we will adopt this guidance on October 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation Overall Transition, amending previous guidance to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. ASC 810 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated statement of income, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC 810 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parents owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary and shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2009). We do not have significant noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, and therefore, adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Under ASC 825, companies that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. In addition, the guidance establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The fair value option election is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. ASC 825 is effective the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007 and is to be applied prospectively, unless the entity elects early adoption. Consequently, we adopted ASC 825 effective October 1, 2008 and elected not to apply the fair value option. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defining fair value, outlining a fair value hierarchy (requiring market based assumptions be used, if available) and setting disclosure requirements of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. On October 1, 2008, we adopted, without material impact on our consolidated financial statements, the provisions of ASC 820 related to financial assets and liabilities. We will adopt the provisions of ASC 820 related to non financial assets and liabilities on October 1, 2009, and we do not expect the adoption of these provisions to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements This document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning, among other things, our prospects, expected revenue, expenses and profits, developments and business strategies for our operations, all of which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward looking statements include all statements other than historical fact, including those identified as Outlook and by their use of terms and phrases such as expect, estimate, project, forecast, believe, achievable, anticipate, should and similar terms and phrases that convey the uncertainty of future events and outcomes. These statements are based on certain 39 Table of Contents assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances but that may not prove to be accurate. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, general economic and business conditions; global economic activity; oil and natural gas market conditions; political and economic uncertainty; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Report, including under Item 1A. Risk Factors. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and, other than as required under securities laws, we do not assume a duty to update or revise these forward looking statements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations internationally and changing interest rates, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. Our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. If the floating rates were to increase by 10% from September 30, 2009, our combined interest expense to third parties would increase by a total of $3 thousand each month in which such increase continued. At September 30, 2009 and 2008, we had fixed rate debt outstanding of $498.9 million and $498.7 million, net of discount, respectively. These instruments are fixed rate and, therefore, do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $11.3 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their rates at September 30, 2009. Periodically, we borrow funds which are denominated in foreign currencies, which exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements. There were $7.2 million and $7.6 million borrowings denominated in foreign currencies at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. When management believes prudent, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. There were no such forward foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2009 or 2008. The expected maturity dates and fair value of our market risk sensitive instruments are stated below (in millions of U.S. dollars): Expected Maturity Dates Fair Value9/30/09 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total SHORT TERM BORROWINGS: Bank borrowings; denominated in foreign currencies average rate 4.5% $ 7.2 $ $ $ $ $ $ 7.2 $ 7.2 LONG TERM BORROWINGS: 5.75% Senior Notes due 2011 250.0 250.0 260.0 6% Senior Notes due 2018 250.0 250.0 251.5 Total $ 7.2 $ 250.0 $ $ $ $ 250.0 $ 507.2 $ 519.7 40 Table of Contents
