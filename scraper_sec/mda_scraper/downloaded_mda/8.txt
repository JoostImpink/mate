ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is the Companys analysis of its financial performance and of significant trends which may impact future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes thereto. Certain of the statements made in the Companys MD&A are forward looking statements related to the transition to integrated solution sales and are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: unanticipated delays in implementation/transition to delivery of integrated solutions; uncertainty in oil and gas markets; competitive factors and pricing pressures; timing of development and acceptance of new product/services; technical obsolescence of the Companys products/services; inability to recruit required sales management, marketing and consulting personnel; and the risks detailed from time to time in the Companys SEC reports, including the Form 8 K filed on April 2, 1996 that identifies certain of these risk factors. The Company, incorporated in 1982, designs, markets and supports software and systems which are used in exploration and production efforts of oil and gas companies worldwide. The Company derives revenues from licensing software products, providing related professional and consulting services and reselling hardware. In most instances, customers pay the Company an initial license fee for the software. Generally, revenue from software is recognized by the Company upon shipment. Customers have the option to pay an annual maintenance fee, calculated as a percentage of current list price, which entitles them to routine support and product updates. The Company generally recognizes revenues related to customer support agreements ratably over the contract period. See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. Many of the Companys customers are shifting from functional organizations to interdisciplinary teams, which is creating the need for integrated products and service sales. Accordingly, the Companys sales, marketing and support organizations are currently being configured to better address the emerging "solutions" market. These solution sales have the longer term potential of generating larger contracts and more recurring revenue; however, they can also lengthen customers decision making processes. The Company believes that its competitors are dealing with similar changes in their sales and marketing organizations. The transition of the Companys sales organization may continue through fiscal year 1997. The transition includes recruiting additional professional sales management and strengthening market capabilities, as well as building a professional and technical consulting organization. This transition may have a negative impact on the Companys growth during this period but should position the Company for the ongoing prospects that the market has to offer over the longer term. On March 25, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Advance Geophysical Corporation ("Advance") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 28, 1994, the Company acquired all of the equity interests of Stratamodel, Inc. ("Stratamodel") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 29, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of MGI Associates, Inc. ("MGA") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. On February 28, 1995, the Company purchased certain assets and assumed related liabilities of DRD Corporation ("DRD") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. On June 5, 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of GeoGraphix, Inc. ("GeoGraphix") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. On September 20, 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tech Logic, Inc. ("Tech Logic") in an acquisition accounted for as a pooling of interests. Due to the immateriality of this transaction and its effect on the historical financial statements of the Company for prior periods, those statements have not been restated to reflect the operating results and financial condition of Tech Logic. On March 29, 1996, the Company purchased the general application software operations of Western Atlas International, Inc. ("WAII") in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein give effect to the acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests (other than Tech Logic) for all periods presented and include the results of acquired 16 18 operations accounted for as purchases and Tech Logic since the dates of acquisition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the related notes thereto. PROPOSED MERGER On June 30, 1996, the Company and Halliburton Company ("Halliburton") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton. The Merger Agreement provides for the exchange of 0.574 shares of Halliburton common stock for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock and for all outstanding options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock to be assumed by the corporation surviving the Merger and converted into options to purchase shares of Halliburton common stock. The Merger transaction is subject to the Companys shareholder approval and is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. No adjustments have been made in the accompanying audited financial statements of the Company to give effect to the Merger because the proposed transaction has not been consummated. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain items in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues or of their respective revenue components and the percentage change in the dollar amount of those items for each of the years in the three year period ended June 30, 1996. YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, PERCENTAGE CHANGE 1996 1995 1994 1995 1996 1994 1995 Revenue: Software product sales............................. 44 % 49 % 49% (1)% 19% Hardware product sales............................. 16 19 22 (8) 0 Services........................................... 40 32 29 34 35 Total revenue.............................. 100 100 100 9 20 Cost of revenue: Cost of software product sales(1).................. 12 12 9 (2) 56 Cost of hardware product sales(1).................. 91 83 83 1 0 Cost of services(1)................................ 51 59 65 16 23 Total cost of revenue...................... 40 40 41 8 16 Gross profit......................................... 60 60 59 11 22 Operating expenses: Research and development........................... 13 12 13 25 8 Selling, marketing and administrative.............. 37 34 32 17 30 Acquired research and development.................. 6 2 N/A 204 N/A Restructuring, merger and other costs.............. 2 3 9 (7) (67) Total operating expenses................... 58 51 54 26 12 Income from operations............................... 2 % 9 % 5% (74)% 132% (1) This line item is expressed as a percentage of the corresponding revenue line item and not as a percentage of total revenues. FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995 Total revenue. Total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1996 ("FY1996") increased $16.1 million, or nine percent, from total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1995 ("FY1995"). This increase is mainly attributable to a 34 percent growth in services revenue. International revenue comprised approximately 52 percent of total revenue in FY1996 as compared to 56 percent in FY1995. Software product sales. Software product sales consist of license fees for the Companys proprietary and third party software. Software product sales decreased by $447,000, or one percent, from FY1995. Software product sales as a percentage of total revenue was 44 percent in FY1996 compared to 49 percent in FY1995. The Company expects that this revenue should continue to be a significant portion of total revenue but will decline in the future as a percentage of total revenue as the Company expands its professional services market. 17 19 Hardware product sales. Hardware product sales relate to the resale of third party computer hardware. Hardware product sales decreased $2.6 million, or 8 percent, from FY1995. This decrease is due primarily to the Companys decision to offer hardware sales only to customers who desire comprehensive system solutions. Services. Services revenue relates to maintenance and support of the Companys hardware and software products, and increasingly from revenue from a variety of other professional services, including implementation, consulting and integration of applications. Services revenue in FY1996 increased $19.1 million, or 34 percent, from FY1995. Maintenance support revenues increased by $10.8 million, or 26 percent, from FY1995 due mainly to the continued expansion of the installed base of the Company. Professional services revenue increased $8.3 million, or 60 percent, from FY1995 as a result of the Companys emphasis on professional and technical consulting services. Cost of software product sales. Cost of software product sales as a percentage of software revenue was 12 percent in both FY1996 and FY1995. Cost of hardware product sales. Cost of hardware product sales as a percentage of hardware product sales increased to 91 percent in FY1996 compared to 83 percent FY1995. The Companys offering of sales discounts to customers in response to competitive pressures, particularly in the United States market, negatively affected margins on hardware product sales in FY1996. As price competitiveness in the computer hardware industry persists, discounts and the resulting impact on hardware margins may continue. Although hardware product contributes a lower margin, the Company plans to offer hardware sales only to customers who desire comprehensive solution sales. Cost of services. Cost of services as a percentage of the related revenue decreased from 59 percent in FY1995 to 51 percent in FY1996. This decrease in cost as a percentage of related revenue is mainly attributable to the combination of higher maintenance support revenue associated with the expanding installed base with only a minimal increase in related cost, offset by increased costs related to the higher revenue from professional services revenue. Research and development. Research and development costs increased $5.1 million, or 25 percent, from FY1995. This increase over the prior year relates primarily to the addition of the MGA development function and the related costs. The Company believes that continued investments in research and development are important to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. The Company capitalized $6.2 million or 20 percent of total research and development costs during FY1996 as compared to $3.7 million or 16 percent in FY1995 due to the increased level and range of products under development. The Company amortized $3.8 million and $3.5 million of capitalized software costs in FY1996 and FY1995, respectively. Selling, marketing and administrative. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $10.0 million, or 17 percent from the FY1995 amount. As a percentage of revenue, these costs were 37 percent in FY1996 compared to 34 percent in FY1995. The increase primarily is a result of the increased costs of approximately $5.5 million associated with the transition of the sales, marketing and support organizations. In addition, increased costs of approximately $2.0 million related to the upgrade of the Companys information system infrastructure were incurred in FY1996. Acquired research and development costs. Acquired research and development costs of $11.3 million for FY1996 relate primarily to the in process research and development activities acquired in connection with the WAII acquisition. The Company reviewed the status of the acquired research and development activities and determined that certain projects require further development by the Company and that technological feasibility had not been established for certain of these activities under the Companys software development plans and method to account for software development costs. In addition to determining whether technological feasibility had been reached, the Company determined that these projects did not have alternative future uses to the Company. Therefore, a separate valuation of the replacement cost of these activities was performed and resulted in a valuation of $11.0 million. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this amount was expensed at the date of the WAII acquisition. The Company expects to incur approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million during the next 12 to 18 months to document, merge and embed the acquired code and development activities into products to be released in the future. 18 20 In FY1995, $3.7 million was expensed as research and development costs as a result of a similar evaluation performed in connection with the purchase of certain assets of DRD. Restructuring, merger and other costs. In July 1995, the Company completed a strategic planning process which concluded with the decision to proactively realign its resources. A restructuring charge of $3.1 million was recorded in FY1996 to reflect severance costs for terminated employees, facility consolidation and write down of certain assets of the Company. In March 1996, a charge of $1.0 million was recorded to reflect the write off of redundant assets and activities as a result of the WAII acquisition. This charge included approximately $688,000 for capitalized software that would be replaced by acquired WAII applications and the remaining for personnel and related costs. Merger costs of $4.5 million in 1995 consist of advisor fees related to the acquisitions of Stratamodel and GeoGraphix and certain restructuring, termination and relocation charges related to the Stratamodel acquisition. Taxes. During FY1996, the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate and lower than the prior years rate. The effective rate decreased primarily due to benefits recognized from the Companys Foreign Sales Corporation. FISCAL 1995 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1994 Total revenue. Total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1995 ("FY1995") increased approximately 20% compared to total revenue for the year ended June 30, 1994 ("FY1994"). The increase in total revenue was primarily due to increased sales to international markets and the addition of the MGA product line. The Companys continued expansion into developing markets in Europe, Asia and Latin America contributed to the increase in international revenue of approximately 28 percent over the FY1994 amounts. International revenue comprised approximately 56 percent of total revenue in FY1995 as compared to 53 percent in FY1994. FY1995 revenue includes approximately $12.0 million related to the MGA product line which was acquired in the first quarter of FY1995. Software product sales. Software product sales consist of license fees for the Companys proprietary and third party software. The increase in software product sales of approximately 19 percent over the prior fiscal year was attributable to new product offerings, acquired product lines and strengthened sales of the Companys core products. As a percentage of total revenues, software product sales remained constant at 49 percent. The software product sales increase of approximately $13.4 million resulted in a positive impact on gross profit. The Companys strategy of offering petroleum companies a complete spectrum of software applications has had a positive impact on software product sales. Hardware product sales. Hardware product sales relate to the resale of third party computer hardware. Hardware product sales remained constant at approximately $31.8 million. As a percentage of total revenue, hardware product sales decreased from 22 percent in FY1994 to 19 percent in FY1995. This decrease is due primarily to the Companys decision to continue to shift away from sales of hardware to sales of software. Services. Services revenue relates to maintenance and support of the Companys hardware and software products as well as revenues from training and consulting. As a percentage of total revenue, services increased from 29 percent in FY1994 to 32 percent in FY1995; services increased approximately $14.5 million, or 35 percent, from the previous year. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a 59 percent increase in software maintenance revenues which resulted from the expanding installed base of the Companys products and a $3.6 million contribution by MGA. Hardware maintenance revenues remained constant at approximately $6.6 million. The Companys hardware maintenance revenues have been impacted by the presence of third party companies that offer hardware maintenance at often lower prices. In response to this trend, the Company began outsourcing hardware maintenance business activities in FY1995. Cost of software product sales. Cost of software product sales, as a percentage of software revenue, increased from 9 percent in FY1994 to 12 percent in FY1995. Increased royalty costs resulting from higher sales of third party applications and increased embedding of third party applications in the Companys products has negatively impacted the current years software product margins. Cost of hardware product sales. Cost of hardware product sales, as a percentage of hardware product sales, remained constant at 83 percent in FY1995 and FY1994. Although hardware contributes a lower 19 21 margin, the Company plans to continue to offer hardware to accommodate sales of software and services to customers who desire comprehensive solutions. Cost of services. Cost of services decreased as a percentage of the related revenues from 65 percent in FY1994 to 59 percent in FY1995. While preserving hardware maintenance revenues, the Company reduced expenses by discontinuing processing services and outsourcing hardware maintenance services. These decisions have positively impacted the services margin. Research and development. Research and development costs increased 8 percent during FY1995 over the prior year. The increase over the prior year relates to the addition of the MGA development function and the related costs. The Company believes that continued investments in research and development are important to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace. The increase in costs was partially offset by a higher level of capitalized software costs during FY1995. The Company capitalized approximately $3.7 million or 16 percent of total research and development costs during FY1995 as compared to approximately $2.7 million or 13 percent in FY1994 due to the increased level and range of products under development. The Company amortized $3.5 million and $2.3 million of capitalized software costs in FY1995 and FY1994, respectively. Selling, marketing and administrative. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased approximately $13.5 million from the FY1994 amount. As a percentage of revenue, the costs increased from 32 percent in FY1994 to 34 percent in FY1995. The increase relates to incremental costs associated with the addition of the MGA operations and increased selling costs related to expanding the Companys presence in Europe and Asia. Acquired research and development costs. Acquired research and development costs of $3.7 million which approximate 2 percent of total revenues for FY1995, relate to in process development activities for projects which were acquired in connection with the DRD purchase, but had not yet reached technological feasibility. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, this amount was expensed at the date of acquisition. Restructuring, merger and other costs. Restructuring and other non recurring charges, which approximate one percent of total revenue for FY1995, relate to the Companys restructuring plan which was designed to eliminate redundancies and consolidate the Stratamodel operations. Management expects this restructuring plan to result in reduced spending for the Company. Additionally, non recurring costs, including relocation and other acquisition related charges, were incurred in connection with the Stratamodel acquisition. Merger costs, which approximate less than 2 percent of total revenue for FY1995, consist of accounting, legal and investment banking costs related to the acquisitions of Stratamodel and GeoGraphix. Merger costs for FY1995 decreased approximately $11.0 million from FY1994 primarily due to the inclusion in prior year of a compensation charge related to Advances Phantom Stock Plan. Other income, net. Other income, net increased approximately $1.4 million from FY1994 to FY1995. This increase was primarily attributable to higher net interest income resulting from higher investment yields on invested funds. Taxes. During FY1995, the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate and lower than the prior years rate. The effective rate decreased primarily due to recognition of deferred tax benefits of an acquired company. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which approximated $2.2 million at June 30, 1995, relates to certain deferred assets associated with an acquired company. Full realization of the total benefit is dependent upon, among other things, the Companys ability to maintain the present level of earnings. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents decreased $5.8 million from June 30, 1995. Cash provided by operating activities for FY1996 was $41.3 million offset by cash used in investing activities of $35.5 million and cash used in financing activities of $11.6 million. Trade accounts receivable increased $6.1 million from June 30, 1995, due primarily to higher fourth quarter FY1996 revenues, offset by increased collection efforts. Adjusted for non revenue accounts receivable, the Companys FY1996 and fourth quarter days sales outstanding were 102 days and 87 days, respectively. 20 22 Management intends to focus efforts on maintaining a quarterly days sales outstanding within a 80 to 90 day range. Software development costs, net increased by $4.7 million from June 30, 1995 due to the $1.3 million of software development costs recorded in connection with the WAII acquisition, $1.0 million in connection with Argus as defined below, $700,000 in connection with other acquisitions and the $6.2 million of costs capitalized during FY1996. These additions were offset by $3.8 million of amortization of software development costs in FY1996 and a $688,000 write off in connection with the WAII acquisition. The Company will continue to incur substantial software development costs in the future. Goodwill increased $11.1 million from June 30, 1995. This increase is primarily attributable to the $4.6 million of goodwill recorded from the WAII acquisition and to a guarantee of $6.9 million of future payments related to the MGA acquisition. The initial MGA guaranteed payment of $1.8 million was paid in September 1995. Additional MGA guaranteed payments of $2.3 million and $2.8 million are due in September 1996 and 1997, respectively. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $9.2 million from June 30, 1995 due partially to the recording of the $2.3 million current liability related to the second MGA guaranteed payment that is due on September 30, 1996. The remainder of the increase was due to timing of the receipt and payment of vendor invoices. Based on the nature of these accounts, period to period fluctuations can be expected to continue. Current maturities of long term debt increased by $2.0 million due to the recording of the $3.0 million line of credit guarantee related to the MGA acquisition offset by the payoff of $1.0 of the term and credit revolver in October 1995. Other long term liabilities increased by $2.9 million from June 30, 1996. This increase mainly represents the final MGA guaranteed payment that is due to be paid September 30, 1997. Long term debt decreased by $11.0 million from June 30, 1995 as a result of the payoff of the term loan and credit revolver in October 1995. The Companys primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations. External sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing. On December 15, 1995, the Company terminated its $25.0 million credit facility and entered into a $100.0 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of seven banks. The agreement contains certain restrictive and financial covenants, including those related to indebtedness, net worth and fixed charges, and provides for guarantees by certain subsidiaries of Landmark. At June 30, 1996, there were $4.4 million in letters of credit and no revolving loans outstanding under this facility and the Company was in compliance with the aforementioned loan covenants. The Company believes funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future. In connection with the MGA transaction, the Company acquired an option to purchase the equity interests of a corporation owned by certain of the former shareholders of MGA ("Argus") in exchange for a $3.0 million line of credit guarantee. On April 29, 1996, this option agreement was terminated and the Company was assigned ownership of certain software previously owned by Argus. The Company made interest payments on behalf of Argus through June 30, 1996, and recorded $3.0 million as short term debt as the Company believed it would be called to perform on the $3.0 million outstanding under the Argus credit agreement. On July 1, 1996, the Company paid off the $3.0 million outstanding under this credit agreement. The Company has not paid cash dividends since its inception and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the future. The Company presently intends to retain earnings for use in its business, with any future decision to pay cash dividends dependent on the Companys growth, profitability, financial condition and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Companys revolving credit agreement restrict the Companys ability to pay cash dividends. Management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses. These acquisition opportunities may involve the use of cash or, depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition, may require debt or equity financing. Expenses associated with these potential acquisitions and post acquisition integration issues may have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations in the period the transactions are consummated or the periods shortly thereafter. 21 23

The primary markets the Company serves include pulp and paper; paints and adhesives; construction materials; food, pharmaceutical and personal care; and industrial specialties, including oilfield and general industrial. More than 50% of the Companys revenues are generated outside of North America. Net sales by region expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were: 2007 2006 2005 North America 47 % 49 % 47 % Europe 35 % 34 % 37 % Asia Pacific 12 % 11 % 11 % Latin America 6 % 6 % 5 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Business Segments The Company currently operates through two active reportable segments: Paper Technologies and Ventures (PTV) and the Aqualon Group (Aqualon). PTV includes the following business units: The Paper Technologies business and the Ventures business which includes Pulping chemicals, Water treatment chemicals, Lubricants and Building and Converted products. Aqualon includes the following business units: Coatings and Construction, Regulated Industries, and Energy and Specialties. A reporting segment is also maintained for FiberVisions for historical reporting purposes reflecting the Companys consolidation of this business through March 31, 2006. The Company currently holds a 34.5% ownership interest in the FiberVisions business. The results of operations for 2005 and the three months ended March 31, 2006 reflect the Companys 100% ownership of this business. Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 as a percent of total net sales, by segment, were: 2007 2006 2005 Paper Technologies and Ventures 54 % 53 % 50 % Aqualon Group 46 % 44 % 36 % FiberVisions 3 % 14 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Key Developments During 2007, the following business and corporate actions and financial reporting developments had an impact upon the Companys results of operations and financial position as well as the overall presentation of financial information: (1) initiation of a share repurchase program and common stock dividend, (2) business acquisitions and investments, (3) formal signing and initiation of offshoring and outsourcing agreements as well as continued progress applicable to the Business Infrastructure Project, (4) resolution and settlement of significant legacy litigation and environmental matters, (5) formal agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the resolution of certain income tax matters and the receipt of a substantial portion of estimated tax refunds, (6) implementation of a liability driven investing strategy for the Companys U.S. and United Kingdom (U.K.) defined benefit pension plans and (7) the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). A discussion of these developments follows. Share Repurchase Program and Common Stock Dividend During 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common stock and declared quarterly cash dividends of five cents per share beginning in the third quarter of 2007. A total of 2.8 million shares were repurchased for $54.3 million during 2007. These matters are discussed in greater detail within the discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources and Commitments and Contractual Obligations that follow. 13 Table of Contents Business Acquisitions and Investments During 2007, the Company completed two transactions: (1) the acquisition of the specialty surfactants business of Dexter Chemicals, LLC (Dexter) for $10.6 million and (2) the formation of H2H Innovations, LLC (H2H), a technology joint venture between Heartland Resource Technologies (Heartland) and Hercules, which resulted in a cash investment of $5.0 million. The Dexter business has been integrated into the Aqualon segment and manufactures and markets products for the coatings industry. H2H has been integrated into the Ventures component of PTV. Additional information regarding these activities is provided in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion of Commitments and Contractual Obligations that follows. Business Infrastructure Project In January 2007, the Company signed outsourcing/offshoring agreements with Genpact International, HCL America Inc. and HCL Technologies Limited and proceeded with plans to transition certain corporate and business support activities and services in connection with the Companys previously disclosed Business Infrastructure Project. Activities associated with these agreements, as well as those with other service providers initiated during 2006, are operational and progressing in various phases of transition as contemplated in the project plans. During these transitional periods, the Company is incurring restructuring and severance charges, exit costs and other related implementation charges as well as accelerated amortization. A total of $33.3 million of such charges attributable to these specific activities has been recorded during 2007. Additional detail is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Resolution of Income Tax Matters and Receipt of Estimated Refunds During 2007, the Company reached agreement with the IRS on all remaining income tax matters for the years 1993 through 2003, resulting in the recording of an additional benefit of $56.6 million, including interest, over and above the amounts recorded during the fourth quarter of 2006. In addition, the Company has received approximately $222 million of an estimated $241 million in federal income tax refunds, including interest, during 2007. The Company also expects to receive a total of approximately $4 million in state income tax refunds of which approximately $3 million was received during 2007. The remaining estimated amounts are projected to be received during the first half of 2008. Resolution and Settlement of Legacy Litigation and Environmental Matters During 2007, the Company paid $124.5 million in connection with the lawsuit captioned United States of America v. Vertac Corp. et al. (Civil No. 4:80CV00109 GH, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division) (the Vertac litigation). Significant charges for this matter were recorded in prior periods resulting in only the accrual of periodic interest and the impact of the cash payment on the 2007 financial statements. However, the Company received notification from the government in July 2007 with respect to the governments claim for reimbursement from the Company of additional response costs related to the Vertac matter with the Companys share totaling approximately $18.7 million. Interest continues to accrue on this amount and has resulted in a total accrual of $20.0 million as of December 31, 2007. Additional information regarding this matter is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company reached a settlement with the United States Navy in connection with environmental issues at the Alleghany Ballistics Laboratory site (the ABL matter). The settlement resulted in the recording of a charge and payment during 2007 of approximately $13 million. Implementation of New Pension Plan Investment Strategy As discussed in further detail in the Commitments and Contractual Obligations section that follows, the Company implemented a liability driven investing strategy that is designed to generally align the characteristics of the Companys U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans assets to those of the underlying benefit obligations with the objective of mitigating the impact of interest rate and asset value volatility. Voluntary contributions to these plans during 2007 was driven in part by the implementation of this strategy, as well as the impact of the settlement of litigation involving the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Adoption of FIN 48 The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007 and recorded $1.9 million as an adjustment to its beginning balance of retained earnings and a corresponding decrease to its income tax reserves recorded in the balance sheet caption Deferred credits and other liabilities in accordance with the required transition provisions. The Company has identified $35.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007. Additional information regarding the adoption of FIN 48 is provided in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys Summary of Significant Accounting Policies is provided in Item 8. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires Hercules to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Hercules evaluates its estimates on a regular basis, including those related to impairments of goodwill, intangible and other long lived assets, income taxes, contingencies, including those related to litigation, environmental issues, asset retirement obligations, asbestos lawsuits and claims, pension and other benefit obligations and stock based compensation. Hercules bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience, consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts, and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management reviews significant estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Hercules believes that the following accounting estimates are critical due to the significant subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. In addition, the Company consistently considers factors including deterioration in future economic conditions, poor operating results in the reporting units, new or stronger competitors, or changes in technology that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets, thereby requiring an impairment in the future. To assess impairment, the Company compares its reporting units book values of net assets, including goodwill, to its fair value. Fair value is estimated using a combination of valuation approaches including the market value and income approaches. Income valuation methodologies are based on estimates of future cash flows discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate of return (discount rate) that essentially represents the Companys cost of capital. The key assumptions considered in the development of estimates of future cash flows include (1) revenue growth including price and volume, (2) cost of sales growth including raw materials prices and labor and benefit costs, (3) indirect corporate overhead, working capital and capital expenditures commensurate with the sales and cost growth rates and (4) the discount rate. The estimate of future cash flows inherently involves significant management judgment as it represents a forecast of future events. In addition, the discount rate is also subject to change from year to year based on the relative balance of the Companys outstanding debt and equity, actual rates of interest on outstanding debt and the Companys stock price. The following table summarizes the approximate average impact of a change in the most significant of these assumptions on the fair value of the Companys net assets, while all other assumptions are held constant: Change Average Impact Discount rate +/ 0.5 % +/ $ 140 million Revenue growth +/ 1.0 % +/ $ 340 million Cost of sales growth +/ 1.0 % +/ $ 205 million The Company has identified its two active operating segments, PTV and Aqualon, as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangible assets as well as the assessment for impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets have been allocated to the reporting units as a result of prior transactions in which these individual reporting units acquired net assets or otherwise expanded their ownership interests in other related businesses. The underlying assets related to such transactions, including goodwill and intangible assets, have been and continue to be fully integrated into the operations of the reporting units. Other Long Lived Assets The Company tests other long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment based on an assessment of factors including deterioration in future economic conditions, poor operating results in a business, the determination that the long lived asset is unsuitable for one reason or another, new or stronger competitors, or changes in technology, that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset, thereby requiring an impairment in the future. In some cases, the underlying assessment is subjective in nature and represents a significant degree of judgment. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies. In the event that Hercules were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had not been established, or is able to utilize capital and or operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been established, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made. 15 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Contingencies The Company establishes reserves for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation exists and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company recognizes a loss for environmental related litigation and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The actual costs will depend upon numerous factors, including: the estimated useful life of the Companys manufacturing facilities and significant component assets, changes in the nature or use of existing assets and facilities, the number of parties found responsible at each environmental site and their ability to pay, the actual methods of remediation required or agreed to, outcomes of negotiations with regulatory authorities, outcomes of litigation, changes in the timing of required remedial activities, changes in the discount rates used to determine the fair value of obligations, changes in environmental laws and regulations, technological developments, the years of remedial activity required and changes in the number or financial exposures of claims, lawsuits, settlements or judgments, or in the ability to reduce such financial exposures by collecting indemnity payments from insurers or others. Each factor is considered sensitive to variation which could impact estimates of the timing and amount of cash flows. Asbestos Related Contingencies The Company has established reserves for asbestos related personal injury lawsuits and claims based upon the results of an annual actuarial study of its asbestos related liabilities by a recognized expert at a major national university. This study is based on a number of assumptions including the anticipated number of future claims, the timing and amount of future payments, disease, venue, and the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and other circumstances. While the expert noted above has applied his methodology in determining the Companys reasonably possible range of exposures for these liabilities on a consistent basis, other methods in practice exist which place a differing degree of emphasis on the underlying variables used to measure asbestos related contingencies. Such other methods could yield significantly different ranges of reasonably possible exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefits costs are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality, medical cost inflation rates, discount rates, long term return on assets, salary increases, Medicare availability and other factors. Changes in these assumptions can result in changes to the recognized pension and other postretirement benefits expense and recorded liabilities. The assets and liabilities associated with the Companys defined benefit pension plans are subject to interest rate and market risk. A 100 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate has an unfavorable or favorable impact of approximately $165 million on the U.S. defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation, which should be offset to a large extent by a commensurate movement in plan assets ( see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Stock Based Compensation For financial reporting purposes, the Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options issued as compensation to key employees and non employee directors. The model determines a fair value based on a number of key variables including the grant date price of Hercules common stock and the related exercise or strike price, estimated dividend yield, estimated term of the option prior to exercise, risk free rate of interest over the estimated term and a measure of the volatility of Hercules common stock over the estimated term. Certain of these variables encompass a degree of subjectivity whose variability could result in significantly different values for the grant date fair value of stock option awards. In addition, the Company recognizes share based compensation cost based upon the number of awards that are expected to vest. This measure implicitly includes an estimate for forfeitures based on employee turnover, reductions in force and other factors specific to the award recipient population. The Company has a policy to review its estimate of award forfeitures on an annual basis or when specific facts and circumstances warrant additional review. The review is primarily based on historical experience and provides for estimated rates applicable to Company officers and all other employees, respectively. Prior to 2007, the Company had estimated different rates for these two employee groups. Based on its most recent annual review, actual experience rates and other factors have resulted in the convergence of the estimated forfeiture rates for the two employee groups. However, future reviews will continue to assess the groups independently. The change in estimated forfeiture rates will result in total share based compensation cost that is lower by less than $1 million than that which would have been recorded had the change in estimate not occurred for 2007. 16 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Review A comparative analysis, by line item, of the Statement of Operations is provided as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Net sales $ 2,136.2 $ 2,035.3 $ 2,055.0 $ 100.9 $ (19.7 ) Net sales for 2007 increased approximately 5% from 2006 primarily as a result of $46.7 million, or 2%, higher volume, $21.2 million, or 1%, attributable to higher pricing and $72.4 million, or 4%, due to favorable rates of exchange (ROE) partially offset by $39.4 million, or 2%, lower product mix. Excluding the impact of the disposition of a majority interest in FiberVisions, sales increased 9%. The increase in volume reflects growth in substantially all of the Companys business units as well as the impact of the Dexter acquisition in the Aqualon segment. In addition, 2007 reflects the full year impact of the consolidation of the Hercules Tianpu methylcellulose (MC) joint venture for Aqualon and operations under the rosin sizing product alliance with MeadWestvaco for PTV. These volume increases were partially offset by the absence of $69.2 million of sales attributable to FiberVisions that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2006 prior to the Companys disposition of its majority ownership interest. Pricing increases were implemented throughout a number of product lines for both PTV and Aqualon in order to recover raw material, energy and transportation cost increases. In addition, the sales growth reflects continued development and introduction of new products. The ROE impact is primarily attributable to continued strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar (USD). The average Euro/USD exchange rate was approximately 9% higher during the 2007 period. Net sales for 2006 decreased approximately 1% from 2005 primarily as a result of the Companys disposition of a majority interest in FiberVisions on March 31, 2006. FiberVisions sales during 2006 were $69.2 million whereas 2005 included a full year in the amount of $282.7 million. Excluding the impact of FiberVisions, net sales for 2006 increased as a result of $183.3 million, or 24%, higher volume, $47.8 million, or 3%, attributable to higher pricing and $8.1 million due to favorable ROE partially offset by $45.4 million, or 2%, lower product mix. The increase in volume was attributable to a combination of Aqualons guar and guar derivatives sales to the energy industry and MC sales resulting from the consolidation of Hercules Tianpu as well as organic growth from PTV and Aqualons other business units. In addition, the guar and guar derivatives and MC acquisitions significantly changed the product mix profile of Aqualon when compared to 2005 resulting in a lower priced product mix. Pricing increases were implemented throughout a number of product lines for both PTV and Aqualon in order to recover raw material, energy and transportation cost increases; however, pricing pressure continued in the MC construction markets. While the Euro strengthened versus the USD during the latter part of 2006, the average was essentially flat compared to 2005. The tables below reflect Net sales per region and the percentage change from the respective prior year periods as well as the percentage change excluding the impact of ROE: % Change Excluding Regions 2007 2006 % Change ROE North America $ 1,002.9 $ 1,003.2 Europe 756.8 696.0 9 % 1 % Asia Pacific 249.3 227.4 10 % 7 % Latin America 127.2 108.7 17 % 12 % All regions $ 2,136.2 $ 2,035.3 5 % 1 % Excluding the impact of FiberVisions as well as the impact of ROE, Net sales increased in all global regions during 2007. The increases were attributable to both PTV and Aqualon with the exception of PTVs performance in the Asia Pacific region where a 3% decline was realized primarily due to successful efforts to improve product mix. During 2007, PTV experienced strong revenue growth in the Americas including the higher growth markets in Brazil and Chile. In addition, both segments achieved growth in higher growth markets in Russia, other Eastern European countries and the Middle East. African markets, which are generally served out of European facilities, continued to provide growth for Aqualon while results were relatively flat for PTV in this region. Aqualon achieved consistent growth in the Asia Pacific region, primarily China, reflecting the segments expanding presence in the country, and was able to more than offset the revenue decline in the region attributable to PTV. 17 Table of Contents % Change Excluding Regions 2006 2005 % Change ROE North America $ 1,003.2 $ 967.9 4 % 3 % Europe 696.0 747.7 (7 )% (6 )% Asia Pacific 227.4 233.7 (3 )% (3 )% Latin America 108.7 105.7 3 % (1 )% All regions $ 2,035.3 $ 2,055.0 (1 )% (1 )% Excluding the impact of FiberVisions, sales increased in all regions during 2006 on an aggregate basis as compared to 2005. Sales in the Americas were particularly strong for both PTV and Aqualon. Within Europe, Aqualon sales continued a strong recovery from the prior year, particularly in the coatings and construction markets, while PTV sales were flat due to excess capacity and regional market fragmentation, continuing the trend that began during 2005. Higher growth markets in China and Eastern Europe provided strong growth opportunities for both PTV and Aqualon while both segments experienced more modest growth in developing markets in the Latin American and Asia Pacific regions. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Cost of sales $ 1,405.7 $ 1,343.4 $ 1,391.1 $ 62.3 $ (47.7 ) As a % of sales 66 % 66 % 68 % Cost of sales increased 5% during 2007 as compared to 2006 commensurate with the higher volume of sales. The increase also reflects higher raw material and energy costs, start up costs attributable to Aqualons capacity expansion in its Chinese operations as well as costs for products purchased for resale to meet customer demand during the start up periods. These increases were partially offset by lower transportation costs in PTV and the impact of higher fixed cost absorption primarily attributable to Aqualon as production continued at or near capacity for a number of high demand products. Raw material cost increases over 2006 levels were $23.4 million. Price increases recovered a substantial portion of these cost increases. However, the terms of certain annual contracts limited the recovery during the latter part of 2007. Contract renewals implemented for 2008 as well as recently announced price increases for certain products linked to those raw materials that have greater price volatility are expected to provide for substantial cost recovery throughout 2008. In addition to pricing and contract initiatives, the Company continues to implement actions to mitigate raw material cost increases including pursuing product substitutions, improving yields and efficiencies and implementing energy conservation programs. Cost of sales decreased 3% during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting the absence of FiberVisions costs subsequent to March 31, 2006. Excluding the effect of FiberVisions, overall costs for raw materials and energy were higher during 2006 as compared to 2005. Price increases and surcharges recovered a substantial portion, but not all of the related cost increases. In addition, improved fixed cost absorption, primarily attributable to Aqualon as production was at capacity for a number of high demand products, as well as lower transportation expenses partially offset the higher costs. On an aggregate basis, raw material and energy costs increased $55.7 million over 2005 levels. While the rate of increase in costs moderated, the overall trend of increasing costs continued from the second half of 2005, when spikes occurred primarily due to the Gulf Coast hurricanes and the related impact on the raw material suppliers and logistics infrastructure. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 376.9 $ 372.2 $ 382.5 $ 4.7 $ (10.3 ) As a % of sales 18 % 18 % 19 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 1% during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily reflecting higher ROE, which contributed $10.6 million to the overall increase. In addition, both PTV and Aqualon incurred employee staffing related costs associated with marketing, technology and other functions to support growth and their expanding presence in certain higher growth markets. The increase also reflects approximately $3 million attributable to the accelerated vesting of certain 2004 restricted stock awards based on the achievement of specific share price performance benchmarks. These increases were substantially offset by lower indirect support costs, primarily in PTVs European operations. In addition, there were decreases attributable to bad debts, incentive compensation, litigation as well as the absence of FiberVisions during 2007. SG&A decreased 3% during 2006 as compared to 2005 reflecting the lower wage and employee expense base attributable to lower overall headcount from a number of restructuring actions. In addition, 2006 SG&A reflected lower professional fees, including audit and tax consulting fees as well as legal fees resulting from the completion and settlement attributable to PTVs patent infringement litigation. The sale of FiberVisions also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher postretirement benefits costs, higher incentive compensation charges attributable to improved performance and a higher number of awards outstanding, higher bad debt charges, higher average ROE and indirect costs attributable to supporting growth in the Asia Pacific region. 18 Table of Contents 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Research and development $ 43.8 $ 38.8 $ 40.8 $ 5.0 $ (2.0 ) As a % of sales 2 % 2 % 2 % Research and development charges increased 13% during 2007 as compared to 2006 reflecting higher spending primarily in the Aqualon Group. This includes higher employee staffing and related costs supporting new product development and product line enhancements. The decrease during 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the FiberVisions transaction and PTVs global research and development consolidation program whereby PTV consolidated its laboratories and technical development facilities into regional centers of excellence. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Intangible asset amortization $ 8.7 $ 7.2 $ 8.0 $ 1.5 $ (0.8 ) Intangible asset amortization increased during 2007 primarily as a result of intangible assets placed in service in connection with the Dexter acquisition and the formation of H2H as well as the impact of a full year of amortization attributable to Hercules Tianpus intangible assets as compared to 2006. Intangible asset amortization decreased during 2006 primarily as a result of the absence of amortization for FiberVisions intangible assets partially offset by increases in amortization attributable to intangible assets recognized with the Benchmark acquisition and consolidation of Hercules Tianpu. Amortization is expected to be $10.2 million for 2008, $8.9 million for 2009, $8.7 million for 2010, $7.9 million for 2011 and $6.6 million for 2012 as various amortization terms expire. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Impairment of FiberVisions goodwill $ $ $ 52.9 $ $ (52.9 ) In connection with the initial commitment to sell a majority interest in FiberVisions at the end of 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $52.9 million. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Other operating expense, net $ 36.9 $ 25.1 $ 39.4 $ 11.8 $ (14.3 ) During 2007, the Company incurred $28.4 million of severance, restructuring and other exit costs, as well as $14.4 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization charges attributable to the continued execution on several restructuring and rationalization programs that were initiated during the current and prior years (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The most significant active restructuring program is the Business Infrastructure Project. The most significant asset charge is attributable to accelerated amortization of certain capitalized software development costs in connection with the ongoing information technology platform upgrade. In addition, the Company incurred $8.1 million in dismantlement, asset retirement and environmental and other costs. These items were partially offset by gains on asset dispositions of $12.4 million including $7.4 million related to certain PTV intellectual property, $4.1 million attributable to the sale of the Companys former facility at Pendlebury, U.K., which was closed during 2006 in connection with a manufacturing rationalization program, $0.5 million attributable to the sale of the Companys former research facility in Barneveld, The Netherlands and $0.4 million related to other fixed asset and excess land dispositions. Additionally, the Company realized $1.6 million of legal recoveries related to a domestic product anti dumping suit against certain competitors. Other operating expense, net for 2006 reflects $21.1 million in severance benefits and other exit costs resulting from the scheduled termination of approximately 300 employees, accelerated depreciation and amortization of $5.1 million as well as $3.2 million of asset impairment charges primarily attributable to the Companys various restructuring and rationalization programs (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The 2006 programs include the Business Infrastructure Project, the segment realignment as well as PTVs initiation of an alliance agreement for the manufacturing and marketing of certain rosin based sizing products. Also included in 2006 is a charge related to the settlement of a product liability claim for $1.3 million, net of recoveries from insurance, site dismantlement costs of $1.6 million primarily attributable to the Wilmington Research Center revitalization project, $0.8 million of asset retirement and environmental charges and $1.5 million of other miscellaneous operating costs. These costs were partially offset by gains of $6.2 million primarily related to the disposition of excess land at operating facilities in Parlin, New Jersey, Tarragona, Spain and Alizay, France and a $3.3 million legal settlement, net of related costs, attributable to a favorable judgment in the Companys price fixing suit against certain raw materials suppliers. 19 Table of Contents During 2005, the Company executed a number of restructuring and rationalization programs and recorded total charges of $37.3 million, including severance and other exit costs of $31.8 million that resulted in headcount reduction of approximately 490 employees; asset impairments of $0.5 million (see Note 16 the Consolidated Financial Statements), accelerated depreciation charges of $3.5 million; and inventory and spare parts write downs of $1.5 million. Other charges for 2005 include $0.7 million related to legal settlements, $0.2 million of asset retirement and environmental charges for active operating sites, losses on asset dispositions of $0.1 million and $1.1 million for all other miscellaneous charges. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Interest and debt expense $ 68.6 $ 71.2 $ 89.4 $ (2.6 ) $ (18.2 ) Interest and debt expense decreased 4% during 2007 primarily as a result of approximately $214 million of U.S. debt repayments made during the year including those attributable to the Term B variable rate loan, the 6.6% notes due 2027 and the 11.125% senior notes due 2007. Total interest expense reductions attributable to these issues were approximately $9 million. Lower interest expense on other debt issues, the absence of FiberVisions debt and higher capitalized interest combined for an additional $1.7 million reduction. These reductions were partially offset by a $6.4 million lower benefit from cross currency interest rate swaps attributable to the weakening USD and decreasing LIBOR based interest rates, as well as $1.7 million attributable to higher local borrowings related to the financing of expansion projects in China. Interest and debt expense for 2006 decreased 20% from 2005 as a result of lower outstanding debt balances, primarily reflecting the Companys repurchase of $113.9 million of its 11.125% senior notes due 2007. The resulting impact was a combined reduction of $15.8 million in interest and amortization of issuance costs. Also contributing to the reduction was an offset to interest expense of $7.1 million attributed to cross currency interest rate swaps, $1.0 million attributable to lower outstanding balances on the 6.5% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, $0.8 million attributable to the absence of FiberVisions debt and $0.3 million of lower credit facility fees. These decreases were partially offset by increasing LIBOR based interest rates on the Companys Term B loan resulting in $6.4 million higher interest expense and $0.4 million related to borrowings utilized to finance capacity expansion projects in China. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Vertac response costs and litigation charges $ 20.3 $ 108.5 $ 15.0 $ (88.2 ) $ 93.5 Vertac related costs incurred during 2007 primarily reflect charges and accrued interest attributable to a claim by the government for additional responses costs at the Vertac site. The Company is continuing to pursue a settlement of this matter (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, charges incurred during 2007 include interest accrued on the Vertac litigation judgment through the date of payment, which occurred during the second quarter of 2007. As a result of a ruling during 2006 in the Vertac litigation, the Company recorded a $106.0 million charge and continued the accrual of interest through the year. The 2006 charge was incremental to an accrual initially provided during 2005. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Other expense, net $ 24.0 $ 65.7 $ 71.3 $ (41.7 ) $ (5.6 ) During 2007, the Company incurred net charges of $5.7 million attributable to legal fees for asbestos related litigation costs, net of interest accretion from the asbestos insurance trusts and a downward adjustment to the asbestos litigation reserve as determined by the independent reserve study (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, the Company incurred charges of $16.1 million in settlements and legal expenses attributable to previously divested businesses including approximately $13 million for the ABL matter, as well as $7.2 million for asset retirement and environmental related charges for sites associated with former businesses. Also included is a charge for $2.8 million attributable to an asset devaluation in connection with a dilution of the Companys ownership interest in FiberVisions during 2007, offset by $0.3 million related to the reversal of accrued costs associated with the 2006 FiberVisions transaction. Partially offsetting these charges are gains on asset dispositions, interest and other miscellaneous income of $7.5 million. Gains on asset dispositions include $2.5 million for certain real estate properties associated with previously divested businesses and $0.5 million attributable to the sale of the Companys equity interest in Abieta Chemie GmbH (Abieta). 20 Table of Contents During 2006, the Company incurred net charges of $29.0 million with respect to its asbestos related liabilities including an adjustment to reestablish the reserve and legal expenses partially offset by accretion income from the asbestos insurance trusts. Also during 2006, the Company sold a majority interest in FiberVisions for $27.0 million and realized a loss of $13.3 million. Other expenses, net for 2006 also includes $11.4 million of premiums and debt issuance cost write offs primarily attributable to the repurchase of the 11.125% notes due 2007, $9.2 million for legal expenses and settlements attributable to previously divested businesses and $6.5 million of asset retirement and environmental related expenses and revisions for former operating sites, exposures at sites for which former businesses were identified as a potentially responsible party and demolition and remediation at other former operating sites. Partially offsetting these charges are certain cost recoveries related to previously divested businesses, the realization of currency translation adjustments attributable to the liquidation of certain inactive legal entities, interest and other miscellaneous income. The combined amount of these offsetting items was $2.3 million. The Company also realized a gain of $1.4 million on the sale of its former operating facility in Addison, Illinois. During 2005, the Company recorded net charges of $44.6 million to reestablish and increase its asbestos related reserve and litigation costs partially offset by accretion income from the asbestos insurance trusts and other related insurance and legal recoveries. The Company also incurred $7.3 million in asset retirement and environmental charges attributable to non operating sites or related activities associated with previously divested businesses including amounts attributable to revisions in the asset retirement obligations. Other expenses, net for 2005 also included charges of $19.0 million for the settlement of several cases relating to previously divested businesses, the most significant of which related to the former Composite Products division as well as premiums of $14.3 million for repurchases of the Companys 11.125% notes and $1.8 million for the write off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, partially offset by a $1.9 million gain related to the repurchase of CRESTSSM units. These items were also offset by $10.9 million of gains on the disposition of the Langhorne, Pennsylvania and Burlington, New Jersey sites that were non operating facilities associated with the previously divested water treatment and resins businesses, respectively. In addition, the Company realized other miscellaneous income of $2.9 million, net of all other miscellaneous expenses. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Benefit for income taxes $ (20.3 ) $ (192.2 ) $ (3.8 ) $ 171.9 $ (188.4 ) Effective tax benefit rate 13 % Not Meaningful 11 % The benefit for income taxes during 2007 was impacted primarily by a $56.6 million benefit due to resolution with the IRS of all remaining income tax matters for the years 1993 through 2003, and resulting interest income. The Company also recognized a $4.9 million benefit related to income tax law changes enacted in China, Germany, the U.K., Canada and Mexico. The change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets reflects the utilization and expiration of capital loss carryforwards and the increase in state net operating loss carryforwards. The benefit for income taxes during 2006 was primarily impacted by the resolution of substantially all issues related to Federal tax audits for the years 1993 through 2003 and the utilization of capital loss carryforwards. The settlement of IRS audits resulted in a reversal of $44.1 million of income tax reserves as well as $49.7 million of tax refunds and interest income. In addition, the provision reflects a tax benefit of $102.7 million for the expected utilization of existing capital loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets reflects utilization of the aforementioned capital loss carryforwards, the basis difference in the carrying value of the Companys investment in FiberVisions and the increase in state deferred tax assets. The benefit for income taxes during 2005 was impacted by a $10.0 million reversal of federal income tax reserves due to favorable resolutions of prior year tax issues and net interest income of $2.9 million resulting from the refund of excess cash tax deposits. These favorable benefits were offset by a $7.1 million increase to state tax expense relating to the filing of amended income tax returns to reflect IRS audit adjustments as well as a $7.6 million charge related to previously undistributed foreign earnings triggered by the transaction to sell a majority interest in FiberVisions. The change in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets reflects the utilization of capital loss carryforwards, the utilization and expiration of state net operating loss carryforwards, and the impairment charge on the carrying value of FiberVisions. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries $ (0.6 ) $ (1.4 ) $ (1.0 ) $ 0.8 $ (0.4 ) Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries during 2007 primarily reflect the income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Hercules Tianpu partially offset by losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests in H2H. Results during 2006 are substantially attributable to the operations of Hercules Tianpu while 2005 reflects the impact of FiberVisions bicomponent fibers marketing joint venture entities. 21 Table of Contents 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Equity (loss) income of affiliated companies, net of tax $ (0.1 ) $ (3.2 ) $ 0.5 $ 3.1 $ (3.7 ) Equity losses during 2007 primarily reflect losses attributable to FiberVisions, partially offset by equity earnings attributable to the Companys investment in Pakistan Gum Industries (PGI) and earnings from Abieta prior to the Companys disposition of its interest therein. The equity loss for 2006 primarily reflects losses attributable to FiberVisions subsequent to the disposition of the Companys majority ownership interest. Equity earnings during 2005 reflect income attributable to PGI and Abieta. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 8.0 $ 47.0 $ (6.5 ) $ (39.0 ) $ 53.5 Net income from discontinued operations for 2007 and 2006 includes $1.4 million and $48.7 million, respectively, attributable to the reversal of various income tax reserves with respect to the resolution and expiration of certain indemnity matters as well as completion and settlement of IRS audits for 2002 and 2003. Also included in income for 2007 is $6.6 million resulting from the reversal of estimated taxes payable for previously disposed legal entities. These reserves were established in connection with the Betz Dearborn water treatment business disposition which was classified as a discontinued operation effective 2001. In addition, discontinued operations for the years 2006 and 2005 reflect the results of operations from the Companys terpenes specialties business. Net sales included therein are $2.5 million and $13.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The terpenes specialties business generated pre tax operating losses of $2.6 million and $9.9 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, including restructuring charges and other exit costs as well as asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $8.1 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. 2007 2006 2005 2007 Change 2006 Change Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, net of tax $ $ 0.9 $ (2.5 ) $ (0.9 ) $ 3.4 As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments effective January 1, 2006, the Company recorded a $0.9 million benefit, net of income taxes, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Effective December 31, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47, Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.5 million, net of tax (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Segment Review The tables below reflect Net sales and Profit from operations for the comparative periods 2007 as compared to 2006 and 2006 as compared to 2005, respectively. 2007 2006 Change % Change Net sales: Paper Technologies and Ventures Paper Technologies $ 903.4 $ 845.7 $ 57.7 7 % Ventures 247.2 229.6 17.6 8 % 1,150.6 1,075.3 75.3 7 % Aqualon Group Coatings & Construction 476.0 420.2 55.8 13 % Regulated 241.6 225.3 16.3 7 % Energy & Specialties 268.0 245.3 22.7 9 % 985.6 890.8 94.8 11 % FiberVisions 69.2 (69.2 ) NM Consolidated $ 2,136.2 $ 2,035.3 $ 100.9 5 % Profit from operations: Paper Technologies and Ventures $ 113.6 $ 80.8 $ 32.8 41 % Aqualon Group 199.0 187.4 11.6 6 % FiberVisions 0.5 (0.5 ) NM Corporate Items (48.4 ) (20.1 ) (28.3 ) NM Consolidated $ 264.2 $ 248.6 $ 15.6 6 % 2006 2005 Change % Change Net sales: Paper Technologies and Ventures Paper Technologies $ 845.7 $ 810.7 $ 35.0 4 % Ventures 229.6 206.6 23.0 11 % 1,075.3 1,017.3 58.0 6 % Aqualon Group Coatings & Construction 420.2 356.4 63.8 18 % Regulated 225.3 174.1 51.2 29 % Energy & Specialties 245.3 224.5 20.8 9 % 890.8 755.0 135.8 18 % FiberVisions 69.2 282.7 (213.5 ) (76 )% Consolidated $ 2,035.3 $ 2,055.0 $ (19.7 ) (1 )% Profit from operations: Paper Technologies and Ventures $ 80.8 $ 61.4 $ 19.4 32 % Aqualon Group 187.4 155.5 31.9 21 % FiberVisions 0.5 (64.9 ) 65.4 NM Corporate Items (20.1 ) (11.7 ) (8.4 ) (72 )% Consolidated $ 248.6 $ 140.3 $ 108.3 77 % NM not meaningful 23 Table of Contents Paper Technologies and Ventures 2007 compared to 2006 Net Sales Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2006 Due To: Volume Product Mix Price Rates of Exchange Total Paper Technologies 4 % (1 )% 4 % 7 % Ventures 2 % 4 % 2 % 8 % 4 % (2 )% 1 % 4 % 7 % PTVs overall sales growth reflects continued expansion in higher growth markets as well as progress with new product introductions which represent approximately 24% of total sales. In addition, PTV realized the beneficial impact of various currencies, primarily the Euro, strengthening against the USD. Pricing was favorable primarily in the Americas region partially offset by lower pricing in both Europe and the Asia Pacific region. As discussed further below, product mix was impacted by the rosin sizing product alliance which began in the second half of 2006. Paper Technologies Sales Paper Technologies volume growth was achieved in the Americas and in Europe, whereas volume in Asia was lower. In the Asia Pacific region, declines in China, Taiwan and Korea were partially offset by improvement in Indonesia. Excluding the Asia Pacific region, strong growth continues to be achieved in the higher growth markets, particularly Brazil, Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa and the Middle East. In the aggregate, sales in higher growth markets increased 20% as compared to 2006. Price increases were achieved in North America primarily to recover raw material cost increases, but were essentially offset by lower pricing in Europe and the functional product portfolio in Asia. Product mix was impacted by the rosin sizing product alliance whereby PTV is the exclusive distributor for these products produced by MeadWestvaco. The overall effect resulted in an increase in volume for lower margin products. The alliance activity reached full operating scale during 2007 as compared to 2006 during which activity did not begin until the second half of the year. Ventures Sales Sales growth was achieved in all of the Ventures businesses, particularly Water Treatment and Building and Converted products. Pricing increased across the entire Ventures portfolio with particular success in the Lubricants business in response to market increases in the cost of methanol. Product mix was adversely impacted by higher volume associated with lower priced adhesive products in the Building and Converted products business as well as toll produced Water treatment chemicals, substantially offset by certain Pulp and Water treatment products. The favorable impact of ROE is primarily attributable to Venture products sold in Europe and Latin America. PTV 2007 Profitability Analysis of Changes in Profitability 2006 Profit from operations $ 80.8 Changes due to: Volume 14.3 Product mix (4.2 ) Price 11.2 Raw material, transportation and energy costs (8.5 ) All other manufacturing costs (6.6 ) Asset dispositions 5.0 ROE 6.6 SG&A and other expenses 5.9 Restructuring, severance and other exit costs, accelerated depreciation and other charges 9.1 Net change 32.8 2007 Profit from operations $ 113.6 Profit from operations during 2007 increased by 41% as compared to 2006 reflecting the favorable impact of volume, price, ROE, lower SG&A and lower restructuring related charges partially offset by higher manufacturing related costs. The 2007 period also reflects $7.4 million related to a gain on the sale of certain intellectual property as compared to a gain of $2.9 million related to the sale of excess land at the Tarragona, Spain facility during the 2006 period. SG&A costs decreased primarily as a result of lower support costs, and lower patent defense costs and bad debt charges partially offset by increased personnel related costs to support strategic growth initiatives. The decrease in patent defense costs reflects a settlement that was reached at the end of 2006. 24 Table of Contents Higher raw material costs of $15.3 million reflect increases in the prices of tall oil rosins, epichlorohydrin, and fatty and adipic acid partially offset by favorable variances for Chinese gum rosin, methanol, acetaldehyde and sodium hydroxide. These cost increases were partially offset by lower transportation and energy costs for a combined decrease of $6.8 million. These decreases were primarily attributable to lower transportation costs as a result of mix improvement, carriers billing certain customers directly and lower negotiated rates for certain services with Hercules preferred distribution network. Severance, restructuring and other exit costs and accelerated depreciation during 2007 resulted in combined charges of $5.7 million as compared to $14.8 million during 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to significant actions during the 2006 period with respect to defined restructuring programs for: (1) research and development consolidation, (2) rationalization of manufacturing capacity including the closure of PTVs Pendlebury facility in the U.K., (3) the alliance with MeadWestvaco and (4) the business segment realignment. During 2007, PTV initiated plans to exit production activities at its Mexico City, Mexico manufacturing facility during 2008. As a part of this rationalization program, the Company will terminate the workforce at that facility upon the completion of various closure activities. Severance and termination benefits are being accrued over the period of continued service required of these individuals. In order to maintain its position in Mexico, the Company has appointed an exclusive distributor in Mexico and has contracted with that party to produce certain paper chemical products under a royalty bearing license agreement. In addition, PTV initiated a restructuring action during 2007 at its Voreppe, France manufacturing facility in connection with continuing efforts to realign its European operating profile. PTV Outlook PTV expects to continue to sustain growth in certain higher growth markets, particularly in non Western Europe and South America while addressing product mix challenges in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, PTV continues to focus its efforts on its successful new product launch strategy with an emphasis on developing higher value, higher margin products to improve the overall sales mix. During 2007, PTV invested in the H2H joint venture to expand the development of adhesive products for wood laminates and composites that comply with new formaldehyde emission standards. 2006 compared to 2005 Net Sales Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2005 Due To: Volume Product Mix Price Rates of Exchange Total Paper Technologies 1 % 2 % 1 % 4 % Ventures (3 )% 9 % 4 % 1 % 11 % 1 % 4 % 1 % 6 % Overall, improved performance in the Americas offset challenging economic conditions in the Western European paper market. Volume growth was achieved in the Americas and in the Asia Pacific region offsetting declines in Europe. Increased pricing was achieved in all regions with higher increases in the Americas and Asia, as opposed to Europe where price increases were more modest. In addition, revenues in higher growth markets including Brazil, China, the Middle East and Africa exceeded prior year levels. Paper Technologies Sales Paper Technologies volume increase is primarily attributable to the marketing and manufacturing alliance for rosin size products partially offset by the impact of customer bankruptcies and mill closures, particularly in Southern Europe. Price increases were achieved in all regions of the world with the largest increase attributable to the Americas. Product mix was essentially flat as variances reflect higher sales of lower priced functional products in both North America and higher growth Asia Pacific markets substantially offset by higher priced process chemicals reflecting the success of new product introductions. Ventures Sales Ventures sales increase reflects improved product mix as well as higher pricing and favorable ROE partially offset by lower volume. The improved mix reflects higher sales of water management, lubricants and adhesive products. 25 Table of Contents PTV 2006 Profitability Analysis of Changes in Profitability 2005 Profit from operations $ 61.4 Changes due to: Volume (1.3 ) Product mix 3.3 Price 37.9 Raw material, transportation and energy costs (36.8 ) All other manufacturing costs (1.1 ) Asset dispositions 2.6 ROE 1.8 SG&A and other expenses 6.4 Restructuring, severance and other exit costs, accelerated depreciation and other charges 6.6 Net change 19.4 2006 Profit from operations $ 80.8 Profit from operations increased 32% during 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase reflects improved selling prices, which contributed to the recovery of higher raw material, transportation and energy costs, as well as favorable product mix and ROE. The disposal of excess land at the Tarragona, Spain facility resulted in a realized gain of $2.9 million. In addition, PTV incurred lower SG&A expenses primarily as a result of the significant restructuring actions taken during 2006 and 2005. Additionally, legal fees associated with patent defense costs during 2006 were substantially lower than 2005 as the patent infringement suit was settled at the end of 2006. These decreases were partially offset by higher corporate support costs, primarily related to incentive compensation, as well as higher bad debt accruals. Primarily as a result of the rapid escalation in costs experienced in the second half of 2005 and continuing into 2006, overall costs for raw material, transportation and energy for 2006 increased over 2005 levels. In addition to energy related price pressure, supply for certain raw materials in certain regions was constrained. In particular, crude tall oil rosin prices were at high levels due to high demand and limited supply, particularly in Europe. Increased demand for gum rosin in the Asia Pacific region, particularly due to domestic consumption in China and certain weather events, resulted in higher costs during 2006. Additionally, pricing for adipic acid and epichlorohydrin was stable at relatively high levels and prices for methanol increased sharply due to outages and supplier force majeure actions. With respect to restructuring actions, PTV recorded charges of $10.5 million during 2006 for severance benefits and other exit costs primarily attributable to efforts to de layer management and streamline the sales and marketing organization in connection with the segment realignment as well as the manufacturing rationalization attributable to PTVs rosin sizing product alliance transaction. These costs also include charges attributable to the closing of the research facility in Jacksonville, Florida and its related relocation to Wilmington, Delaware. PTV results reflect $3.1 million of accelerated depreciation charges of which $2.1 million was attributable to the closure of the Pendlebury, U.K. manufacturing facility during the first quarter of 2006. The remaining $1.0 million was related to the closing of the Jacksonville facility and the shut down of certain production lines at manufacturing facilities in connection with the aforementioned alliance. Aqualon Group 2007 compared to 2006 Net Sales Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2006 Due To: Volume Product Mix Price Rates of Exchange Total Coatings & Construction 11 % (4 )% 1 % 5 % 13 % Regulated (1 )% 4 % 2 % 2 % 7 % Energy & Specialties 13 % (7 )% 1 % 2 % 9 % 9 % (2 )% 1 % 3 % 11 % All of Aqualons business units had increased sales during 2007 as compared to 2006. Volume increases benefited broadly from additions to capacity brought on line during the year as well as the impact of acquisitions during 2007 and those initiated during 2006. Pricing increases were achieved in all of Aqualons business units during the 2007 period. In addition, Aqualon realized the beneficial impact of various currencies, primarily the Euro, strengthening against the USD. Coatings and Construction Sales Sales into the Coatings markets increased 13% during 2007 reflecting substantial growth in all major regions of the world with the exception of North America. Sales increased in Europe by 18%, the Asia Pacific region by 24% and Latin America by 30%. North American sales increased slightly compared to 2006. However, this reflects an overall decline primarily attributable to challenges in the U.S. housing market that was substantially mitigated by the impact of the Dexter acquisition. Absent the accretive impact of the Dexter acquisition, sales in North America declined by 4%. Aqualon continues to have success with its synthetic thickener, Aquaflow, which offset a 26 Table of Contents portion of the domestic decline in the hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) Natrosol product lines. Aqualon is currently expanding its capacity in this fast growing product line. Aqualon continues to successfully drive growth in part due to the pursuit of its adjacency strategy which includes additional product platforms. Specifically, Aqualon continues to grow the recently acquired surfactants product line for the coatings industry, including markets outside of North America. Sales into the Construction markets were higher by 13% on a global basis during 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of higher volume. Strong growth in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America offset declines in North America. Asia Pacific sales growth of 48% reflects the improved operability of Aqualons methylcellulose (MC) joint venture, Hercules Tianpu, in China. The joint ventures facility was operating at near capacity in the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2007. In mid January 2008, the joint venture experienced a setback due to an incident at its manufacturing facility. After a thorough investigation, Hercules Tianpu expects to bring the operation back on line to meet customer orders and return to full operational capability during the first quarter of 2008. It is expected that the overall financial impact on the Company will be minimal. Regulated Industries Sales Regulated Industries sales increased primarily as a result of improved product mix reflecting a higher proportion of sales into higher priced pharmaceutical and personal care markets. Despite growth achieved in Europe and China, overall volume declined in the United States primarily due to a customer plant consolidation and the adverse impact of associated order patterns. Overall price increases were achieved in many of the regulated end markets. In addition, Aqualon initiated a rationalization of certain regulated product lines due to raw material availability and cost. Aqualon anticipates this business to return to a more typical order pattern in the first quarter of 2008. Energy and Specialties Sales Energy and Specialties sales increased during 2007 reflecting increases in both specialty and oilfield volume. Increases in specialty sales reflect growth in most regions of the world. Oilfield sales growth was achieved primarily in the United States partially offsetting declines in Europe and the Middle East primarily due to formulation changes and order patterns attributable to certain Middle East customers. Pricing and ROE in the aggregate provided a component of the annual increase as well. The unfavorable product mix is primarily attributable to a higher portion of guar versus other oilfield product sales, including HEC, among others. Aqualon 2007 Profitability Analysis of Changes in Profitability 2006 Profit from operations $ 187.4 Changes due to: Volume 27.4 Product mix (10.4 ) Price 10.0 Raw material, transportation and energy costs (8.5 ) All other manufacturing costs (0.9 ) Asset dispositions (2.8 ) ROE 3.7 SG&A and other expenses (7.3 ) Restructuring, severance and other exit costs and accelerated depreciation and other charges 0.4 Net change 11.6 2007 Profit from operations $ 199.0 Profit from operations increased 6% during 2007 as compared to 2006 period. The increase reflects higher volume and the associated contribution margin, increased selling prices and favorable ROE as discussed above. Higher raw material costs are primarily attributable to price increases for cotton linters and monochloroacetic acid partially offset by favorable prices for caustic applicable to carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) products and higher prices for methylchloride and caustic applicable to MC products, primarily in China. In addition, Aqualon incurred increased supply chain and start up costs primarily associated with the expanded MC capacity at the Hercules Tianpu facility in China. Also reflected are higher start up costs and third party purchases for resale associated with the delayed start up of an additional CMC production line in Jiangmen, China. This line, which was originally scheduled to begin operation in July 2007, commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2007 and began qualifying product with customers and regulatory agencies. It is anticipated to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2008. 27 Table of Contents SG&A costs were higher during 2007 reflecting increased sales, marketing, business management, technology and other spending to support growth partially offset by lower corporate allocations. In addition, both 2007 and 2006 reflect gains on the sale of excess land at certain operating facilities. Total gains during 2007 were $2.8 million lower than 2006 which contributed to the unfavorable variance during 2007. Severance, restructuring and other exit costs were lower during 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of significant actions during the 2006 period impacting a larger group of employees with respect to restructuring programs for the realignment of the Companys business segments. However, the 2007 period included the termination of a portion of the production personnel at the Companys Dalton, Georgia manufacturing facility related to the discontinuation of guar production at that facility and the related transfer to the Kenedy, Texas manufacturing facility. The production of guar derivatives will continue at the Dalton site. Aqualon Outlook Aqualon expects global markets, particularly higher growth markets in China and Eastern Europe, to continue to provide healthy sales and operating profit growth prospects. However, conditions are expected to remain challenging in the North American coatings and construction markets consistent with difficulties in the U.S. housing market. Volume growth and profitability is anticipated to continue across all of Aqualons businesses as availability and utilization of expanded capacity increases into 2008. Pricing increases, many of which have been implemented heading into 2008 are expected to offset the rising cost environment with respect to raw materials. Additional capacity for HEC is planned in connection with the construction of a new facility in Nanjing, China. This facility is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, new product development in connection with Aqualons adjacency strategy is anticipated to provide an increasing proportion of sales growth in future periods. The proportion of sales of products less than five years old increased to 22% in 2007 as compared to 18% in 2006. There have been several recent new product introductions including Aquaflow, fast hydrating guar for the energy sector, the N Hance product line for personal care and Culminal products for tile cement. 2006 compared to 2005 Net Sales Percentage Increase (Decrease) from 2005 Due To: Volume Product Mix Price Rates of Exchange Total Coatings & Construction 26 % (5 )% (3 )% 18 % Regulated 15 % 7 % 7 % 29 % Energy & Specialties 13 % (6 )% 2 % 9 % 24 % (7 )% 1 % 18 % Aqualons sales increased during 2006 primarily as a result of the acquisition of the guar and guar derivatives business from Benchmark and the consolidation of Hercules Tianpu. Despite the overall unfavorable impact on product mix, Aqualon experienced increased sales in all of its business lines. Coatings and Construction Sales Coatings and Construction sales were strong in most regions, including Europe, which recovered from the general decline experienced during 2005. Sales of Coatings products into the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region were especially strong during 2006 while North American growth was lower. Sales of Construction products were also strong in Eastern European and other higher growth markets. Pricing for Coatings products was up slightly during 2006, while pricing for Construction products was lower as a result of pricing challenges in the MC construction products markets. Regulated Industries Sales Regulated industry sales increased during 2006 as compared to 2005 reflecting an improved mix attributable to a greater concentration of higher priced products sold into the food and pharmaceutical markets. Price increases were achieved in food and pharmaceutical products, whereas personal care was lower. Volume increased in many end markets and regions, including China, reflecting higher pharmaceutical and personal care product sales. Energy and Specialties Sales Energy and Specialties sales increased during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the acquisition of the guar and guar derivatives business which accounted for over half of the total sales increase. Demand in the natural gas and oil services sector was also strong and price increases were achieved in oilfield and many specialty product families. 28 Table of Contents Aqualon 2006 Profitability Analysis of Changes in Profitability 2005 Profit from operations $ 155.5 Changes due to: Volume 70.4 Product mix (35.2 ) Price 9.9 Raw material, transportation and energy costs (14.2 ) All other manufacturing costs 7.1 Asset dispositions 3.3 ROE SG&A and other expenses (9.0 ) Restructuring, severance and other exit costs and accelerated depreciation and other charges (0.4 ) Net change 31.9 2006 Profit from operations $ 187.4 Profit from operations for Aqualon increased 21% during 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher volume and prices and the associated contribution margin partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Raw material and energy costs increased reflecting the increase in costs during the latter half of 2005 that continued into 2006. Specifically, raw materials including ethylene oxide, guar splits, methyl chloride, propylene oxide, caustic, gum rosin and limonene all experienced significant increases from the prior year. Lower transportation costs more than offset higher energy costs, the majority of which was related to Europe as a result of the expiration of a long term fixed price utility contract. Pricing increases captured approximately 70% of these costs. However, downward pricing pressure continued in the MC construction product lines throughout most of 2006. SG&A costs were higher compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting increased sales and marketing, business management, incentive compensation and technology costs incurred to support growth initiatives as well as the impact of the consolidation of Hercules Tianpu. These costs were partially offset by net realized gains of $3.2 million primarily attributable to the sale of excess land at the Parlin, New Jersey and Alizay, France facilities as compared to a net loss on asset dispositions of $0.1 million during 2005. Aqualon incurred $3.7 million of restructuring charges, including severance, during 2006 that were attributable to headcount reductions designed to delayer the management and sales and marketing organizations consistent with the segment realignment. In addition, contract termination costs of $0.4 million were incurred in connection with restructuring global distribution networks. These compared to similar restructuring related charges of $3.7 million during 2005. FiberVisions Effective April 1, 2006, the Company recognizes its proportionate equity interest in the earnings of FiberVisions within the caption Equity (loss) income of affiliated companies, net of tax. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $1.5 million and $3.4 million of losses attributable to FiberVisions, respectively. FiberVisions results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2006 are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations. During that period, FiberVisions had sales of $69.2 million and Profit from operations of $0.5 million. During 2005, FiberVisions sales and loss from operations were $282.7 million and $64.9 million, respectively, which reflect a full year of majority ownership. Corporate Items The Company allocates substantially all of its corporate support costs to the business segments. These costs include those related to cash management, treasury, legal, accounting and audit, tax, safety, information technology and other corporate services. Allocations are based on either a direct cost pass through for items directly identified as related to segment activities; a percentage allocation for such services provided based on factors such as headcount, sales, net assets or cost of sales; or a relative weighting of geographic activity. Corporate items include certain charges and credits that have not been allocated to the business segments. The most significant of these items typically appear in Other operating expense, net, although portions are also reflected in Cost of sales and SG&A, respectively, depending upon the specific nature of the items. 29 Table of Contents The following table reflects the components of those unallocated Corporate items. 2007 2006 2005 Severance, restructuring and other exit costs $ 19.6 $ 6.5 $ 7.5 Asset charges (impairments and accelerated depreciation/amortization) 14.2 5.2 0.5 Legal settlements (3.1 ) 0.1 Gains on asset dispositions (4.7 ) (0.3 ) Dismantlement costs 3.1 1.5 Unallocated corporate costs 12.8 7.9 Other miscellaneous charges, net 3.4 2.1 3.9 Total Corporate items $ 48.4 $ 20.1 $ 11.7 Severance, restructuring and other exit costs incurred during 2007 primarily reflect amounts attributable to the Business Infrastructure Project which encompasses outsourcing and offshoring service arrangements for various functions. As these functions are transferred to external service providers, the Company is incurring severance costs for employees required to provide services during the transition periods as well as related exit costs and other implementation charges. Ancillary to the Business Infrastructure Project is the IT upgrade, which has resulted in $13.7 million of accelerated amortization of capitalized software development costs during the transition period. The accelerated amortization charges and restructuring costs are expected to continue into 2008 and 2009, respectively. Corporate items also includes unallocated corporate costs, costs associated with the dismantlement of inactive portions of certain manufacturing facilities and miscellaneous other operating expenses including costs to prepare certain properties for disposition. These items were partially offset by net gains on the disposition of assets including $4.6 million attributable to the sale of the Companys former facilities at Pendlebury, U.K. and Barneveld, The Netherlands, in connection with the manufacturing rationalization and Research and Development consolidation restructuring programs, respectively. Severance, restructuring and other exit costs for 2006 reflect charges related to the Research and Development consolidation and Business Infrastructure Project and include severance charges attributable to the termination of approximately 220 employees. Also included are relocation fees, restructuring and other exit costs associated with these programs. Total asset charges of $5.2 million include accelerated depreciation on certain assets at the Wilmington, Delaware Research Center and accelerated depreciation and impairment of certain capitalized software costs in connection with the planned IT upgrade. Legal settlements in 2006 primarily reflect a favorable judgment in the Companys price fixing suit against certain raw materials suppliers. Dismantlement costs are primarily attributable to the revitalization project at the Wilmington Research facility. As a result of the FiberVisions transaction, Corporate items include $7.9 million of general administrative costs that would have otherwise been allocated to the FiberVisions reporting segment. Severance, restructuring and other exit costs for 2005 reflect charges related to the Corporate Realignment and Research and Development consolidation restructuring programs and include severance charges attributable to the termination of 50 employees. Also included are relocation costs attributable to the European headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and accelerated depreciation charges related to the Wilmington research facility. Corporate items for 2005 also include professional fees incurred to resolve certain legacy business matters, miscellaneous legal settlements and gains on asset dispositions, among a number of other miscellaneous items. Liquidity and Capital Resources Analysis of Cash Flows Operating Activities 2007 2006 Net income, depreciation, amortization and all other non cash charges and credits $ 312.6 $ 194.3 Changes in working capital, net (19.1 ) (13.4 ) All other sources and uses of cash 6.4 (8.0 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 299.9 $ 172.9 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $127.0 million during 2007 as compared to 2006. The change primarily reflects the net impact during 2007 of the receipt of approximately $222 million of income tax refunds associated with the settlement of issues with the IRS for the years 1993 through 2003 partially offset by the payment of a $124.5 million judgment in connection with the Vertac litigation and a payment of approximately $13 million in connection with the settlement of the ABL matter. Aside from the aforementioned significant cash flow events there were a number of additional discrete cash flow changes that impacted the variance between periods. The most significant among these is an increase of $35.6 million attributable to amounts received from the asbestos settlement trusts in excess of settlement payments. This change includes the receipt of $41.3 million related to the liquidation of one of the settlement trusts during 2007. Payments for severance and termination benefits were $7.2 million lower during 2007 compared to the prior year due to payments to a larger group of employees impacted by actions that were initiated during 2005 and early in 30 Table of Contents 2006. While there are currently a number of employees impacted by ongoing restructuring programs including the Business Infrastructure Project, the timing of payments of severance and termination benefits are dispersed over a greater number of periods based on the longer transition periods unique to this program. Payments for defense costs primarily associated with PTVs patent defense litigation were lower by $3.6 million during 2007 primarily as a result of the completion and settlement of that action during the fourth quarter of 2006. Settlements of asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies decreased by $7.7 million during 2007 primarily due to the timing of various remediation and work plans. These decreases in cash disbursements were partially offset by company contributions to its defined benefit pension plans that were $46.8 million higher than 2006. Increased working capital usage over 2006 levels primarily reflects higher accounts receivable and inventories attributable to growth in the business. Investing Activities 2007 2006 Capital expenditures $ 118.3 $ 93.6 Acquisitions and investments, net 16.5 29.4 Proceeds from asset and investment dispositions and all other sources, net (17.1 ) (28.9 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ 117.7 $ 94.1 Net cash used in investing activities increased $23.6 million during 2007 as compared to 2006. Capital expenditures increased by $24.7 million primarily as a result of Aqualons capacity expansion projects at both its MC and CMC manufacturing facilities in China as well as PTVs synthetic lubricants expansion at its Louisiana, Missouri manufacturing facility. During 2007, the Company made cash payments of $10.6 million and $5.0 million in connection with the acquisition of the Dexter specialty surfactants business and the formation of the H2H technology venture, respectively. In addition, a $1.4 million earn out payment was made to Benchmark Performance Group, Inc. (BPG) during 2007 based on the 2006 performance of the guar and guar derivatives business that was acquired by the Company from BPG at the beginning of 2006 (the Benchmark Acquisition). This payment was partially offset by a $0.5 million payment received from BPG in connection with the Companys $2.5 million loan to BPG during 2006 as well. Acquisitions and investments during 2006 reflect the Benchmark Acquisition, a capital contribution made in connection with the formation of the Hercules Tianpu joint venture and the acquisition of the remaining 40% ownership interest in Shanghai Hercules. Investing outflows during 2007 were partially offset by $14.1 million attributable to the receipt of proceeds, net of transaction costs, from the disposition of various properties including the Companys facilities in Pendlebury, U.K., Barneveld and Rijswijk, The Netherlands and certain real estate holdings in California and New Jersey as well as other miscellaneous retired fixed assets. In addition, total proceeds for 2007 includes $4.2 million, net of transaction costs, attributable to the disposition of the Companys minority interest investment in Abieta. In connection with the sale of the Companys 51% interest in FiberVisions during 2006, the Company received $27.0 million in proceeds, less transaction costs. During 2007, the Company completed its final requirement to provide an additional $1.2 million contribution to FiberVisions based on its performance through the first quarter of 2007. Financing Activities 2007 2006 Long term debt payments $ (216.8 ) $ (142.5 ) Long term debt proceeds and changes in short term debt 13.2 27.8 Long term debt issued by FiberVisions, net of issuance costs 83.7 Repurchases of common stock and dividends paid (51.8 ) Proceeds from the exercise of stock options and all other sources, net 7.8 42.6 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (247.6 ) $ 11.6 During 2007, the Company made principal payments of: $114.0 million on its Term B loan due 2010, $84.1 million in connection with bond holders exercise of a put option with respect to the 6.6% notes due 2027, retired its 11.125% senior notes due 2007 with a final payment of $16.1 million at maturity and $2.6 million on long term borrowings in China. Debt principal payments during 2006 include $113.9 million attributable to a tender offer and other repurchases of the Companys 11.125% senior notes due 2007, $18.0 million on its Term B loan, $6.8 million for FiberVisions variable rate term loans and $3.8 million for the Companys 6.5% junior subordinated deferrable debentures due 2029 (6.5% debentures) in connection with the open market purchase of 5,000 CRESTSSM units, which consists of 6.5% debentures and warrants to purchase the Companys common stock. A total of $21.3 million and $22.0 million of short and long term debt was issued during 2007 and 2006, respectively, reflecting local borrowings, primarily in China, to finance the construction and expansion projects in that region. The more significant of these borrowings relate specifically to Hercules Tianpu. Hercules provides a guarantee for 55% of the total renminbi and U.S. Dollar equivalent borrowings under this credit facility. In addition, net short term borrowings of $9.4 million were received by Hercules subsidiaries under existing credit facilities primarily in Europe and Asia. Prior to the disposition transaction in 2006, FiberVisions issued $90.0 million of debt, net of $6.3 million of issuance costs. The FiberVisions debt is non recourse to Hercules. 31 Table of Contents During 2007, the Company repurchased 2.8 million common shares in connection with its authorized share repurchase program for a total of $54.3 million. Of this total, $46.1 million settled in 2007 and the remaining $8.2 million settled in cash in January 2008. Also during 2007, the Company reinstituted its common stock dividend and paid $5.7 million in connection with the July 23, 2007 dividend declaration of $0.05 per share. Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during 2007 were $6.5 million as compared to $37.0 million during 2006. The decrease is attributable to significant stock price appreciation during 2006 whereas the price range of the stock was relatively stable during 2007. In addition, cash provided by financing activities included $1.8 million and $6.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the income tax benefit to be realized by the Company for stock based compensation as required by SFAS 123R. Identical amounts are included as an outflow in cash from operations. Sources of Liquidity The Company projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources discussed below will be sufficient to meet its investing and financing requirements and enable the Company to comply with the covenants and other terms of the Senior Credit Facility and the indentures governing the senior notes. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a $550 million Senior Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks. Under the Senior Credit Facility, the Company has a $150 million revolving credit agreement, which permits certain additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2007, $102.1 million of the $150.0 million Revolving Facility was available for use as the Company had $47.9 million of outstanding letters of credit associated with the Revolving Facility. In addition, the Company had $35.1 million of foreign lines of credit available of which $31.0 million was unused and available. The total amount of $4.1 million outstanding under these facilities is attributable to operations in the Asia Pacific region. During 2007, the Company amended its Senior Credit Facility Agreement (the Agreement) to: (i) remove a $75 million limitation on asset sales; (ii) increase the annual limitation on capital expenditures from $100 million to $150 million; (iii) increase the limitation on additional indebtedness from $50 million to $150 million; and (iv) provide the Company the ability to pay dividends and or execute stock repurchases for up to $100 million per calendar year subject to the satisfaction of certain financial leverage requirements as defined in the Agreement. The amendment was designed to align the parameters of the Agreement with the Companys current financial profile and projected business and financing plans. In connection with the comprehensive settlement of tax years 1993 through 2003, the Company anticipated the receipt of federal and state income tax refunds and interest of approximately $245 million in total. During 2007, the Company received approximately $225 million of the aforementioned total. The remainder is expected to be received during the first half of 2008. With respect to its asbestos litigation obligations, the Company has total dedicated assets of $28.1 million available as of December 31, 2007 to fund asbestos related settlements and defense costs. These assets include receivables from insurers as well as restricted cash held in trust and cash to be paid to the trust (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In January and February 2008, virtually all of the monies to be paid to the Company and to the trust were paid. As detailed further in the discussion of Commitments and Contractual Obligations that follows, these funding sources are expected to be exhausted during 2008. Upon occurrence of this event the Company will be required to fund its asbestos obligations from its cash from operations and other available financial resources. The Company maintains ownership over a number of properties, including land and buildings, associated with businesses that have been exited, divested or otherwise curtailed. In addition, during the normal course of business, assets associated with current operations, including such items as surplus land and excess or fully depreciated equipment and buildings among others, become available for disposition. In order to maximize their value, the Company is actively engaged in an ongoing process of identifying alternative utilization strategies including leasing and outright sales of the underlying assets and properties. When specific actions progress to the point that plan of sale criteria have been met, impairments, to the extent they exist, are recognized and the underlying properties are reclassified as assets held for sale. Assets held for sale are included in the caption Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of total assets held for sale was $7.7 million as of December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the Companys former research facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This property is currently being marketed and is expected to be disposed within the next twelve months for a net sales price in excess of its carrying value. There are generally no material restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the Companys operations outside the United States except in certain regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America. Financial Condition Total debt as of December 31, 2007 was $796.0 million, which decreased $199.5 million from $995.5 million as of December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of the debt payments and repurchases discussed above. Cash balances decreased to $116.5 million at December 31, 2007 from $171.8 million at December 31, 2006. 32 Table of Contents During 2007, the Companys net working capital balances increased by $36.9 million reflecting continued growth in both segments as well as higher ROE. Of the total net increase, $40.2 million was attributable to accounts receivable primarily reflecting growth in higher growth markets and $13.4 million related to higher inventories necessary to support the business expansion. These were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $16.7 million consistent with the business growth as well as continuing efforts to reduce total cash cycle time. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys cash cycle time increased by a total of 3 days from year end 2006 levels. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased by one day to 61 days largely as a result of expanded growth in certain higher growth markets which generally encompass longer customer payment terms. Days sales in inventory (DSI) increased by two days to 59 days reflecting changes in inventory mix consistent with the increase in production capacity primarily attributable to Aqualon partially offset by improved metrics for PTV. Days payable outstanding (DPO) remained constant at 53 days. Despite challenging conditions, the Company expects to improve its cash cycle time (DSO plus DSI less DPO) during 2008 as efforts continue with respect to working capital initiatives. Commitments and Contractual Obligations Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Commitments Capital expenditures are projected to total approximately $125 million during 2008. Of the total, approximately 27% will be attributable to PTV, 61% for Aqualon and 12% for Corporate purposes. Significant project commitments for 2008 include the development of a multi purpose facility in the Asia Pacific region for PTV, MC capacity expansions at the Doel, Belgium facility and Hercules Tianpus facilities in China, the construction of an HEC facility in Nanjing, China as well as continued progress on the technical and functional upgrades of the Companys information technology platform. In summary, approximately $75 million of the projected total is attributable to expansion and productivity projects while the remaining $50 million is allocated to maintenance capital projects. As a result of the Dexter transaction in 2007, the Company is committed to pay up to $2.0 million within one year of the acquisition date contingent upon the continuity of sales revenues at certain predetermined levels. Also, the H2H joint venture arrangement provides an opportunity for the minority shareholder, Heartland, to require Hercules to purchase all or some proportion of its ownership interest at fair value for up to $15.0 million beginning in July 2011. In addition and also beginning in July 2011, Heartland may purchase an additional 2% ownership interest at fair value from Hercules provided certain financial performance metrics are below levels defined in the agreements. In connection with the Benchmark Acquisition, Aqualon is required to make an earn out payment of $2.0 million during 2008 based on Benchmarks 2007 performance. A similar commitment is in place through 2011 for approximately $1 million to $2 million annually contingent upon the achievement of certain performance metrics. Pension Plan Funding In June 2007, the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors approved a change in the pension asset investment strategy for the Companys U.S. qualified plan. Accordingly, the Company implemented a liability driven investing strategy that is designed to generally align the characteristics of the plans assets to those of the underlying benefit obligations with the objective of mitigating the impact of interest rate and asset value volatility. Under this strategy, approximately 80% of the plans assets have been invested in interest rate sensitive debt instruments. This investment strategy is expected to reduce ongoing funding requirements for a fully funded plan to a level that approximates that plans annual service cost. A similar strategy was implemented for the Companys U.K. pension plan during the first quarter of 2007. The strategy for the U.S. qualified plan has been effectuated through a shift to a fixed income portfolio with a duration to approximate that of the benefit obligations while reducing the plans exposure to equity and other investment securities to 20% of total assets. This strategy is expected to substantially reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow and mitigate the risk of plan under funding due to asset or interest rate changes. Conversely, this strategy limits the ability for the plans to become over funded and will not compensate for actuarial changes including mortality and future compensation changes as well as the incidence of lump sum payments. There can be no assurance that the Companys plans will achieve and or maintain the current funded status. During 2008, the Company expects to provide voluntary funding of approximately $22 million for the U.S. qualified plan and approximately $8 million on a combined basis for all other international plans. Funding for Litigation, Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations As of December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded $78.3 million for environmental and other asset retirement matters involving current and former operating sites, including those with identified asset retirement obligations as well as other locations where the Company may have a known liability (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The annual costs required for remediation and similar asset retirement activities are generally funded from operations as well as proceeds from the disposition of assets. While such obligations are defined by legal, statutory or contractual provisions, the Company has a certain degree of discretion with respect to the timing and magnitude 33 Table of Contents of cash expenditures within a given range of periods. However, unfavorable developments regarding legal, regulatory or operating matters with respect to any existing sites as well as unknown exposures could have a material adverse effect on cash requirements for any annual, quarterly or other period. In addition, the Companys future commitment to certain actions, including modifications to its existing facilities or preparing sites for sale involving demolition and other related activities among others, could trigger the recognition of additional obligations. The Company anticipates funding approximately $18 million towards these obligations during 2008, excluding amounts for the Vertac matter. The most significant of the total projected payments are attributable to the Companys operating facility and related property in Parlin, New Jersey. Obligations at this site include those attributable to existing Aqualon Natrosol manufacturing operations as well as demolition and environmental remediation activities attributable to that portion of the facility that previously housed the Companys former nitrocellulose manufacturing operations. With regard to this portion of the site, the Company is proceeding with plans to dispose of 400 acres in connection with a brownfield redevelopment project. With respect to the Vertac matter, the Company continues the process of reviewing the claim for reimbursement for response costs received from the United States (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the specific amount or timing of the final settlement payment with respect to this matter. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has accrued $20.0 million representing its share of the United States claim plus cumulative interest. Asbestos Related Litigation During 2008, the Company anticipates the total cash requirements for asbestos related litigation matters to be approximately $38 million. Of the total, approximately $28 million is projected for settlements and $10 million is projected for defense costs. It is currently anticipated that all of the funds remaining in the trust will be distributed to the Company during 2008, thereby terminating the trust. As a result, from and after the time that the trust is terminated, the Company will be required to fully fund its asbestos settlements and related defense costs and legal fees from its cash from operations and other available financial resources until such time, if any, that the reimbursement obligations pursuant to the Future Coverage Agreement are triggered based on cumulative asbestos products litigation related expenditures. Depending upon the magnitude of future settlement and defense costs, substantial reimbursement pursuant to such agreement is not anticipated for at least several years, and once such reimbursement begins, it is anticipated that the levels of reimbursement will vary considerably over time. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Debt Retirement In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the Company, from time to time, subject to market conditions and provisions of the Companys credit agreements and indentures, to repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding indebtedness. Scheduled debt maturities during 2008 are $33.7 million. Stock Repurchase Program and Common Stock Dividend During 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of common stock and payments of cash dividends for a combined amount of up to $200 million during a two year period that will end in July of 2009. Stock repurchases under this authorization may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. The declaration of future cash dividends will be subject to determination by the Board of Directors after its review of the Companys performance, applicable debt covenants and other commitments. Through February 27, 2008, the Company has acquired a total of 3.5 million shares for $66.6 million and has paid quarterly cash dividends for a total of $11.4 million. Accordingly, a total of $122.0 million remains available for additional share repurchases and cash dividends through the term of the authorization. At this time, the Company anticipates a total of $75 million in stock repurchases for 2008 and the continuation of a quarterly cash dividend for the remainder of 2008. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by Period (1) Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years Debt obligations $ 796.0 $ 33.7 $ 275.3 $ 6.1 $ 480.9 Operating lease obligations 100.0 21.2 44.1 23.9 10.8 Purchase obligations (2) 4,242.6 739.7 1,634.6 1,868.3 Other liabilities reflected on the registrants balance sheet under GAAP (3) 630.2 106.4 129.3 121.0 273.5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,768.8 $ 901.0 $ 2,083.3 $ 2,019.3 $ 765.2 (1) Does not include the anticipated future interest payments to be made under the Companys current debt agreements; however, based upon current indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2007, such interest obligations are estimated to be approximately $57.7 million in 2008, $56.4 million in 2009, $54.4 million in 2010, $36.5 million in 2011, $36.3 million in 2012 and $599.5 million thereafter. A one percent increase or decrease in the LIBOR rate would have an impact of approximately plus or minus $3.0 million on the Companys interest payments in years 2008 through 2010. (2) Obligations relate primarily to raw material requirements and service contracts. (3) Includes amounts pertaining to asbestos related matters, asset retirement obligations, long term unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs), postemployment and postretirement obligations and workers compensation claims. Due to the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation, it is impractical to determine the anticipated payments in any given year. Therefore, the non current asbestos related liability of $227.0 million has been reflected in the More than 5 years column. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with the Companys UTBs, the entire amount as provided in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements is included in the More than 5 years column. Indemnifications Reference is made to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a thorough discussion of indemnifications. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no relationships with any unconsolidated, special purpose entities or other legal entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Reference is made to the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company has used several strategies to actively hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flows (see "Foreign Currency Translation" and "Derivative Instruments and Hedging" in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Sensitivity of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices, which are reasonably possible over a one year period, are described below. The market values for foreign exchange and interest rate risk are calculated by the Company utilizing a third party software package that employs standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on the market conditions as of the valuation date. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forwards and options and represent a net asset position of $0.3 million and a net liability position of $0.1 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies at December 31, 2007 would result in a decrease of $2.6 million and a negligible change for the year ended 2006 in the net position, while a 10% weakening of the dollar versus all currencies would result in a $1.8 million and a $0.5 million increase, respectively, in the net position. The Company also utilizes cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with its net investment in certain foreign operations. At December 31, 2007, the net market value of the swaps was a liability of $112.1 million. A 10% strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2007 would result in a $61.2 million increase in the liability, while a 10% weakening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar would result in a $61.2 million decrease in the liability. Interest Rate Risk The Companys derivative and other financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist substantially of debt instruments (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net market value of these combined instruments was a liability of $713.8 million and $964.2 million, respectively. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from their levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would result in a $57.9 million and a $60.5 million decrease, respectively, in the net market value of the liability. A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would result in a $49.6 million and a $62.7 million increase, respectively, in the net market value of the liability. Commodity Price Risk The Company did not transact any hedging activities with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements for the year ended December 31, 2007. Equity Price Risk The Companys financial instruments subject to equity price risk consist of the warrants component of the CRESTSSM units issued in 1999 and the Companys 8% convertible debentures due 2010 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Actions taken by the holders of these financial instruments could result in the issuance of additional shares of common stock and thereby increase stockholders equity. The conversion prices are $42.70 per share and $14.90 per share for the CRESTSSM units and convertible debentures, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign exchange forward and option contracts have been used to hedge the Companys firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. With respect to commodity hedging, the Company has, in the past, utilized derivative instruments including forward contracts. Other than cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with its net investment in certain foreign operations, the Company has not designated any derivative as a hedge instrument under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings. 36 Table of Contents
