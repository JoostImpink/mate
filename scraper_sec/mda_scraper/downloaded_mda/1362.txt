Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Words such as believes, expects, anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue, gross margin, operating expense, profitability, income tax expense, effective tax rate, capital spending and cash balances; the adequacy of our cash balances to fund our operations; projected volatility in our financial results; projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of magnetic disk manufacturing equipment and when, and if, our customers will place orders for these products; projected change from period to period in the customers, and location of customers, that constitute the majority of our revenues; the length of development, marketing and deployment cycles for military customers; Imagings ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs and to develop and introduce commercial products; and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, including those set forth under Risk Factors and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview Our operations include two businesses, Equipment and Imaging. The Equipment business designs, manufactures, markets and services complex capital equipment that deposits highly engineered thin films of material onto disks used in hard disk drives and we are developing equipment that we plan sell to semiconductor manufacturers. Our Imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors, cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum, allowing vision in extreme low light situations. The vast majority of our revenue is currently derived from our Equipment business, and we expect that the majority of our revenues for the next several years will continue to be derived from our Equipment business. Equipment Business In the early 1990s we developed a system, the MDP 250, to deposit magnetic films and protective overcoats onto magnetic disks used in hard disk drives. This system gained wide acceptance and by the late 1990s was being used to manufacture approximately half of the disks used in hard disk drives worldwide. In late 2003, we introduced a new system, the 200 Lean. We believe that there are a total of approximately 111 MDP 250 and 80 200 Lean systems currently available for use in production and research and development applications at magnetic disk and hard disk drive manufacturers worldwide. The hard disk drive industry has gone through significant consolidation, and there are now only seven significant manufacturers of magnetic disks, some of whom also manufacture hard disk drives. As a result of the small number of customers and the high average selling price of our products, our Equipment revenues tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter. In addition, our Equipment business has historically been subject to capital spending cycles. For example, in the period from 1995 through the middle of 1998, we sold $300 million of disk manufacturing equipment. In the period from the middle of 1998 thru 2003, our disk equipment revenues averaged approximately $20 million per year and consisted of the sale of a limited number of systems, technology upgrades, parts and service for the installed base of our systems. In 2006, our sales of disk manufacturing equipment grew to $248 million in annual revenues. We believe there is significant potential for magnetic disk manufacturers to continue adding capacity. We believe that the introduction of high density disks based on perpendicular recording techniques will also require disk manufacturers to significantly upgrade the technical capability of their installed base of manufacturing equipment to accommodate the additional number of process steps predicted to be required by perpendicular recording technology roadmaps. In the past we also manufactured both deposition and rapid thermal processing equipment used in the manufacture of flat panel displays. In late 2002, we sold our rapid thermal processing product line and stopped actively marketing our deposition product line. From 2000 through 2004, cumulative revenues from sales of flat 28 Table of Contents panel display manufacturing systems totaled $36.8 million. 2005 revenues included $5 million related to selling a license to one of our flat panel patents and recognizing revenue on the last flat panel system we shipped. Imaging Business Our Imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors, cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum, allowing imaging in extreme low light situations. Our military products include extreme low light sensors and cameras for use in short to medium range military applications and LIVAR cameras and systems for positive target identification at long range. The majority of the funding for our Imaging business activities has historically been derived from research and development contracts with the United States Government and its contractors, with the balance being funded internally. Developing advanced products for the military involves long development cycles, as products move through successive multi year stages of technology demonstration, engineering and manufacturing product development, prototype production and then product deployment. Each stage in this process requires ongoing government funding. To date, substantially all of our Imaging business revenues has been derived from contract research and development, rather than product sales. In July 2002, in order to shorten the time to market and to increase the number of markets for our imaging products, we began to fund development of imaging products for commercial markets. In early 2007, we acquired DeltaNu, LLC, a manufacturer of Raman spectrometers. Although product revenues from these activities have not yet been significant, we expect revenues from product shipments to significantly increase as a percentage of 2007 Imaging revenues. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below. A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. Many of these uncertainties are discussed in the prior section entitled Risk Factors. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with US GAAP, and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operation. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates related to the collectibility of trade receivables and prototype product costs. We believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period. 29 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Certain of our system sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements. If we have previously met defined customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system, then we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the system upon shipment and transfer of title, and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed. We estimate the fair market value of the installation and acceptance services based on our actual historical experience. For systems that have generally not been demonstrated to meet a particular customers product specifications prior to shipment, revenue recognition is typically deferred until customer acceptance. For example, while initial shipments of our 200 Lean system were recognized for revenue upon customer acceptance during 2004, revenue was recognized upon shipment for the majority of 200 Leans shipped in 2005 and 2006. Most of the systems in backlog at December 31, 2006 are for customers where we have met defined customer acceptance levels, and we expect to recognize revenue upon shipment for those systems. In some instances, hardware that is not essential to the functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of the system. In these cases, we estimate the fair market value of the non essential hardware as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis, and defer recognizing revenue on that value until the hardware is delivered. In certain cases, we sell limited rights to our intellectual property. Revenue from the sale of any intellectual property license is generally recognized at the inception of the license term. We perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts. These contracts are a mixture of cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and firm fixed price (FFP). Revenue on CPFF contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms, typically as costs are incurred. Revenue on FFP contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs. Provisions for estimated losses on government sponsored research contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined. Inventories Inventories are priced using average actual costs, which approximate first in, first out, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. A cost to market reserve is established for work in progress and finished goods inventories when the value of the inventory plus the estimated cost to complete exceeds the net realizable value of the inventory. Warranty We provide for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Our warranty is per contract terms, and for our systems, the warranty typically ranges between 12 and 24 months from customer acceptance. We use estimated repair or replacement costs along with our actual warranty experience to determine our warranty obligation. We exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, (SFAS 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely 30 Table of Contents than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Based on our history of losses through 2004, our deferred tax asset was fully offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance were both reduced due to the usage of our remaining NOL and credit carry forwards. As of December 31, 2006, $4.6 million of the deferred tax asset was valued on the balance sheet, net of a valuation allowance of $2.8 million. This represents the amount of the deferred tax asset from which we expect to realize a benefit. We cannot predict with certainty when, or if, we will realize the benefit of the portion of the deferred tax asset currently offset with a valuation allowance. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the level of our projected earnings, the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, net operating loss carry forwards, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from the estimates, this could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, as our projected level of earnings increased throughout 2006, we increased the annual effective tax rate from 3.0% at the end of the first quarter, to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter, to 10.0% at the end of the third quarter and to 12% at the end of the fourth quarter. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Results of Operations Net revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Equipment net revenues $ 248,482 $ 129,280 $ 60,490 92 % 114 % Imaging net revenues 11,393 7,949 9,125 43 % (13 )% Total net revenues $ 259,875 $ 137,229 $ 69,615 89 % 97 % Net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to manufacture thin film disks, and, to a lesser extent, equipment used to manufacture flat panel displays, related equipment and system components; flat panel equipment technology license fees; contract research and development related to the development of electro optical sensors, cameras and systems; and low light imaging products. The increase in Equipment revenues in 2006 was the result of the sale of forty six 200 Lean systems, thirteen disk lubrication systems and a significant increase in revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts. During 2005, we sold twenty three 200 Lean systems, six MDP 250 systems and fourteen disk lubrication systems. 2005 revenues also included $5.0 million of flat panel equipment and license sales. During 2004, we sold eleven 200 Lean systems and two MDP 250 systems. The magnetic disk manufacturing industry consists of a small number of large manufacturers. In 2006 Seagate acquired Maxtor, which further concentrates our customer base. We believe that the majority of our active customers utilize most of their capacity and that there is significant potential for these customers to both continue adding capacity and to upgrade the technical capability of their installed base to permit production of high density disks for perpendicular recording rather than the current longitudinal technology. We currently have twenty five 200 Lean systems in backlog, which are scheduled for revenue recognition during the first half of 2007. Imaging revenues increased by 43% to $11.4 million in 2006, which consisted of $1.7 million of product revenue and $9.7 million of contract research and development revenue. The $7.9 million in 2005 Imaging revenues consisted of $888,000 of product revenue and $7.0 million of contract research and development revenue. The increase in product revenue resulted from higher sales of LIVAR systems and commercial products. The increase in contract research and development revenue was the result of a better mix of fully funded vs. partially funded 31 Table of Contents programs. The decrease in Imaging revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 was the result of a reduction in the level of orders received for funded development programs. In 2007, we expect the Imaging business revenue to grow significantly, with increases in both contract research and development revenue and product revenue. Although we do not anticipate our Imaging business to be profitable in 2007, we expect the loss to be reduced from 2006. Substantial growth in future Imaging revenues is dependent on proliferation of our technology into major military weapons programs, the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers, obtaining production subcontracts for these programs, and development and sale of commercial products. Our backlog of orders at December 31, 2006 was $125.0 million, as compared to a December 31, 2005 backlog of $84.5 million. The $125.0 million of backlog at December 31, 2006 consisted of $119.4 million of Equipment backlog and $5.6 million of Imaging backlog. The $84.5 million of backlog at December 31, 2005 consisted of $81.7 million of Equipment backlog and $2.8 million of Imaging backlog. The increase in Equipment backlog was primarily the result of orders for 200 Lean disk sputtering systems. Significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers. In 2006 sales to Seagate, our Japanese distributor, Matsubo, and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues, and in aggregate accounted for 93% of revenues. In 2005, Seagate, Matsubo, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and Maxtor each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues, and in aggregate accounted for 90% of revenues. In 2004, Seagate and Matsubo each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues, and in aggregate accounted for 74% of revenues. Our largest customers tend to change from period to period. International sales totaled $233.4 million, $97.5 million and $47.1 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, accounting for 90%, 71% and 68% of net revenues. The increase in international sales in 2006 and in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems. Substantially all of our international sales are to customers in Asia, which includes products shipped to overseas operations of U.S. companies. Our mix of domestic versus international sales will change from period to period depending on the location of our largest customers in each period. Gross margin. Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Equipment gross profit $ 97,161 $ 42,623 $ 15,016 128 % 184 % % of Equipment net revenues 39.1 % 33.0 % 24.8 % Imaging gross profit $ 3,798 $ 955 $ 840 298 % 14 % % of Imaging net revenues 33.3 % 12.0 % 9.2 % Total gross profit $ 100,959 $ 43,578 $ 15,856 132 % 175 % % of net revenues 38.8 % 31.8 % 22.8 % Cost of net revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and costs attributable to contract research and development, and also includes fabrication, assembly, test and installation labor and overhead, customer specific engineering costs, warranty costs, royalties, provisions for inventory reserves and scrap. Cost of net revenues for 2006 included $428,000 of equity based compensation expense. Equipment gross margin improved to 39.1% in 2006 from 33.0% in 2005. Our product mix, increased average selling prices, cost reduction programs and increased volume all contributed to the higher gross margin for the year. 2005 Equipment gross margin improved over the gross margin achieved in 2004 due primarily to lower manufacturing costs and a higher average selling price for 200 Lean systems. The flat panel manufacturing system recognized for revenue in 2005 was originally shipped in 2003 and contributed minimal gross profit. Equipment gross margin in 2004 was adversely impacted by costs incurred during the rapid production, installation and start up of the initial production run of 200 Lean systems, by costs for scrap, rework and inventory obsolescence related primarily to design changes on our 200 Lean system, and by favorable pricing offered to our first 200 Lean customer. We expect the gross margin for the Equipment business to improve in 2007, primarily as a result of 32 Table of Contents continued cost reduction efforts undertaken on the 200 Lean system. Gross margins in the Equipment business will vary depending on a number of factors, including product cost, system configuration and pricing, factory utilization, and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. Imaging gross margin improved to 33.3% in 2006 from 12.0% in 2005. The increase in Imaging gross margin resulted from a higher percentage of contract research and development revenue being derived from fully funded contracts, favorable adjustments related to closing out prior year government rate audits and increased product shipments. The improvement in Imaging gross margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily due to a reduction in cost shared research and development contracts. Imaging gross margin in 2004 was negatively impacted by our military head mounted display development program, the initial phase of which was partially funded by the U.S. Government and our NATO customer. Research and development Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Research and development expense $ 30,036 $ 14,384 $ 11,580 109 % 24 % % of net revenues 11.6 % 10.5 % 16.6 % Research and development expense consists primarily of prototype materials, salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research, design and development activities for disk manufacturing equipment, flat panel manufacturing equipment and Imaging products. Research and development spending increased in both Equipment and in Imaging during 2006 as compared to 2005 and in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in Equipment was due primarily to spending on the development of a new product line to serve the semiconductor market and, to a lesser extent, spending for continuing development of our disk sputtering products. The increase in Imaging was due to both spending on the design of a proprietary CMOS sensor for use in our military low light level cameras and spending on the development of our commercial Imaging products. Engineering headcount has grown from 68 at the end of 2004, to 89 at the end of 2005, and to 129 at the end of 2006. Included in research and development spending for 2006 was $1.4 million of equity based compensation expense. We expect that research and development spending will increase again in 2007 due primarily to expenditures related to our new semiconductor equipment product line, and the addition of key engineering personnel. Research and development expenses do not include costs of $6.1 million, $5.3 million, and $6.9 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, which are related to contract research and development and included in cost of net revenues. Selling, general and administrative. Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Selling, general and administrative expense $ 22,924 $ 14,477 $ 9,525 58 % 52 % % of net revenues 8.8 % 10.5 % 13.7 % Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling, marketing, customer support, financial and management costs and also includes production of customer samples, travel, liability insurance, legal and professional services and bad debt expense. All domestic sales and international sales of disk sputtering products in Asia, with the exception of Japan, are typically made by Intevacs direct sales force, whereas sales in Japan of disk sputtering products and other products are typically made by our Japanese distributor, Matsubo, who provides services such as sales, installation, warranty and customer support. We also have subsidiaries in Singapore and in Hong Kong, along with field offices in Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Shenzhen, China to support our equipment customers in Asia. 33 Table of Contents The increase in selling, general and administrative spending in 2006 was primarily the result of increases in costs related to business development, customer service and support in the Equipment business, legal expenses associated with the Unaxis litigation and provisions for employee profit sharing and bonus plans. Included in selling, general and administrative spending for 2006 was $1.5 million of equity based compensation expense. Our selling, general and administrative headcount increased from 63 at the end of 2005 to 77 at the end of 2006. The increase in 2005 over 2004 was primarily the result of increases in costs related to customer service and support in the Equipment business, provisions for employee profit sharing and bonus plans and costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance activities. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2007 over the amount spent in 2006 due primarily to a projected increase in costs related to customer service and support for the Equipment business, the addition of key business development and administrative personnel and increasing legal expenses. Interest income and other, net. Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Interest income and other, net $ 3,778 $ 1,855 $ 1,015 104 % 83 % Interest income and other, net in 2006 consisted of $390,000 of dividends from 601 California Avenue LLC, $3.5 million of interest income on investments and $113,000 in net other expense. The increase in interest income in 2006 was driven by higher interest rates on our investments and a higher average invested balance. Interest income and other, net in 2005 consisted of $390,000 of dividends from 601 California Avenue LLC, $1.3 million of interest income on investments and $155,000 of foreign currency gains and losses and other income. Interest income and other, net in 2004 consisted of $390,000 of dividends from 601 California Avenue LLC, $634,000 of interest income on investments and $46,000 of other income. We expect interest income and other, net to increase in 2007 due to higher interest income generated from our investments. Provision for income taxes. Year Ended December 31, % Change % Change 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (In thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 5,079 $ 421 $ 110 1106 % 283 % In 2006, we accrued income tax using an effective tax rate of 12% of pretax income. This rate is based on an estimate of our annual tax rate calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Our tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and deferred credits. At the end of 2006, we reversed $831,000 of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, reflecting the amount of the deferred tax asset from which we expect to realize the benefit in 2007. Our deferred tax asset of $7.4 million is partially offset by a valuation allowance, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $4.6 million at December 31, 2006. We expect our effective tax rate to significantly increase in 2007 due to the utilization of our remaining net operating loss carry forwards in 2006. For 2005, we accrued income tax using an effective tax rate of 2.5% of pretax income. Our net deferred tax asset totaled zero at December 31, 2005, net of a $15.0 million valuation allowance. In 2004, we recorded income tax expense of $110,000, due primarily to the recording of $115,000 of expense as a result of a claim we received from the California Franchise Tax Board, partially offset by a net credit for taxes owed by our Singapore subsidiary. Our net deferred tax asset totaled zero at December 31, 2004, net of a $19.9 million valuation allowance. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2006, we had $103.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments compared to $49.7 million at December 31, 2005. During fiscal 2006, cash and cash equivalents increased by $24.2 million, due 34 Table of Contents to the cash provided by operating and financing activities, partially offset by the net purchase of investments and fixed assets. Cash provided by operating activities in 2006 totaled $55.2 million compared to $1.4 million in 2005. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was due primarily to the net income earned in 2006, adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including depreciation and equity based compensation, and to increases in accounts payable, accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable totaled $40.0 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $42.9 million at December 31, 2005. The decrease of $2.9 million in the receivable balance was due to the year end collection of customer advances billed in the fourth quarter of 2006. At the end of 2005, $10.8 million of receivables were outstanding related to products that had not shipped. Net inventories increased by $13.1 million during 2006 due primarily to an increase in raw materials and work in progress, which will be used to support the December 31, 2006 backlog of $125.0 million. Accounts payable totaled $16.0 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $7.0 million at December 31, 2005. The increase of $9.0 million relates to the increase in inventory purchases and the general growth of our business. Accrued payroll and related liabilities increased by $6.3 million during 2006 due to increases in our headcount and accruals for bonuses and employee profit sharing. Other accrued liabilities totaled $7.7 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $6.9 million at December 31, 2005. The increase of $5.1 million relates primarily to accruals for our warranty obligations. Customer advances increased by $3.1 million during 2006. The increase was due to advances billed or received for orders that will be shipped during 2007. Investing activities in 2006 used cash of $37.3 million. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, totaled $28.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2006 totaled $8.4 million. Our investing activities in 2005 used cash of $5.9 million as the result of the net purchase of investments and $4.1 million in capital expenditures. Financing activities provided cash of $6.2 million in 2006 due to the sale of Intevac common stock to our employees through our employee benefit plans and tax benefits from equity based compensation. Financing activities provided cash of $2.3 million in 2005 due to the sale of Intevac common stock to our employees through our employee benefit plans. We have generated operating income for the last two years, after incurring annual operating losses from 1998 through 2004. We expect our Equipment business to be profitable again in 2007. We also expect to continue to invest in Imaging during 2007, but with lower losses than in 2006. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, combined with the cash we anticipate generating from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. We intend to undertake approximately $15 million in capital expenditures during the next 12 months. Contractual Obligations In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that will be settled in cash. These obligations consist primarily of operating lease and purchase obligations. The expected future cash flows required to meet these obligations as of December 31, 2006 are shown in the table below. More information on the operating lease obligations is available in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Payments Due by Period Total LT 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Operating lease obligations $ 12,617 $ 2,700 $ 4,525 $ 4,612 $ 780 Purchase obligations 19,433 19,433 Total $ 32,050 $ 22,133 $ 4,525 $ 4,612 $ 780 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K). 35 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place our investments with high quality credit issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Short term investments typically consist of investments in A1/P1 rated commercial paper, auction rate securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at December 31, 2006. Fair 2007 2008 2009 Beyond Total Value Cash equivalents Fixed rate amounts $ 2,680 $ 2,680 $ 2,680 Weighted average rate 5.26 % Variable rate amounts $ 11,484 $ 11,484 $ 11,482 Weighted average rate 5.25 % Short term investments Fixed rate amounts $ 55,596 $ 55,596 $ 55,596 Weighted average rate 5.24 % Long term investments Fixed rate amounts $ 8,000 $ 8,000 $ 7,989 Weighted average rate 5.28 % Total investment portfolio $ 69,760 $ 8,000 $ 77,760 $ 77,747 Due to the short term nature of the substantial portion of our investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Foreign exchange risk. From time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain of our anticipated foreign currency transaction, translation and re measurement exposures. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results. At December 31, 2006, we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts. 36 Table of Contents
