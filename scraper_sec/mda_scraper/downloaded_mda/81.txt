Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Founded in 1986, ATMI generates revenues from product sales and contract research. Most product sales are point of use environmental equipment, specialty materials, and delivery systems for the semiconductor industry. ATMI also receives royalties for certain product sales from third parties. Since 1986, a significant portion of ATMIs revenues has come from contracts with United States government agencies. The programs in which ATMI participates may extend for several years, but are usually funded annually. There can be no assurance that the government will continue its commitment to programs to which ATMIs development projects are applicable or that ATMI can compete successfully to obtain program funding. ATMI has used a targeted acquisition strategy to assist in building critical mass and market position in the niches the Company serves. In 1994 ATMI acquired Vector, and in conjunction with the sale of Novapure product lines to Millipore in September 1994, formed EcoSys by merging the retained operations of Novapure with those of Vector. In 1995, ATMI acquired the Guardian product line from Messer Greisheim Industries and folded that product line into EcoSys. In 1995, ATMI acquired Epitronics Corporation, and in early 1996, combined that business with the formerly known Diamond Electronics division under the Epitronics name. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship to total revenues of certain items in ATMIs consolidated statement of operations: Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 1994 Product revenue ................................. 78.8% 71.0% 63.5% Contract revenue ................................ 21.2 29.0 36.5 Total revenues ............................ 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues ................................ 52.4 56.9 60.7 Gross profit .................................... 47.6 43.1 39.3 Research and development .................. 16.5 14.0 17.3 Selling, general, and administrative ...... 24.8 28.5 28.3 Total operating expenses ............ 41.3 42.5 45.6 Operating income (loss) ......................... 6.3 0.6 (6.3) Other income, net................................ 1.4 1.6 20.2 Income before taxes.............................. 7.7 2.2 13.9 Income taxes..................................... 0.5 0.4 0.6 Net income....................................... 7.2% 1.8% 13.3% 18 The following table sets forth revenues, cost of revenues and gross profit for products and contracts, as a percentage of each category: Year Ended December 31, 1996 1995 1994 Products: Revenues ........................ 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues ................ 43.7 45.0 46.6 Gross profit ...................... 56.3% 55.0% 53.4% Contracts: Revenues ........................ 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues ................ 84.7 86.0 85.2 Gross profit ..................... 15.3% 14.0% 14.8% Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994. Revenues. In 1996, ATMIs total revenues improved 54.3% to approximately $46,350,000 from $30,048,000 in 1995. Total revenues for 1995 were 52.1% greater than 1994s $19,761,000. Product sales were $36,504,000, up 71.1% in 1996, from 1995s product sales of $21,336,000. Product sales for 1996 were 78.8% of ATMIs total revenues, and in 1995, 71.0%. In turn, 1995 showed a 70.2% increase above product sales of $12,538,000 in 1994. Product sales in 1994 were 63.4% of ATMIs total revenues. EcoSys effluent treatment product sales led ATMIs product revenue growth. With its technology leadership and full service philosophy in the environmental niche of the semiconductor market, EcoSys managed to increase market share in the face of a softening capital equipment market. Sales to Pacific Rim based companies continued to be strong. The December 1995 acquisition of the Guardian product line was also responsible for a portion of the revenue growth. This year, sales of effluent gas treatment products were approximately 54% of ATMIs revenues, about $25,076,000. Last year, EcoSys contributed $16,889,000, about 56% of revenues. In 1994, 51% of ATMIs total sales, $10,078,000, were EcoSys product sales. While not a significant factor to date, a continued slowdown in capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry could have a negative effect on EcoSys revenue growth during 1997. The SDS product line has begun to have a significant impact on the Companys revenue growth. The revenue from this product line changed in late 1996 from a royalty stream to a product revenue steam. As a result, the sale of this product represented approximately 9% of total revenues in 1996, up from 3% for the entire 1995 years revenues. General increases in government funding of ATMI research resulted in the growth of contract revenues. For 1996, government funding grew 13.0% to $9,846,000, from $8,712,000 in 1995 and increased 20.6% in 1995 from $7,222,000 in 1994. The increased research funding in 1996 was primarily focused on materials development, device processing and device design activities within NovaMOS and Epitronics. The 1995 growth was primarily related to increased funding of substrate fabrication and materials development projects. 19 Gross Profit. ATMIs gross profit improved this year by 70.4% to $22,069,000 compared to 1995, when gross profit of $12,949,000 had grown 66.6% from $7,771,000 in 1994. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit improved to 47.6% in 1996 from 43.1% in 1995 and increased in 1995 from 39.3% in 1994. In 1996, ATMIs sales mix continued to shift toward greater volumes of high margin products. Consequently, our product revenue gross margin improved 75.3% to $20,565,000 from $11,728,000 in 1995 and increased 75.0% in 1995 from $6,700,000 in 1994. Product gross margin improved to 56.3% of revenues, up from 55.0% in 1995 and 53.4% in 1994. The improved product margins in 1996 were attributed primarily to the significant increases in royalties in connection with SDS product line growth. Additionally, sales of the SDS product commenced late in the year when the Company began manufacturing the product and recognized margins higher than the average ATMI product margin. The effect of the SDS more than offset some slight declines in margin realized on sale of EcoSys products due to geographic and product mix shifts to comparatively lower margin sales. Gross profit on contract revenue increased in 1996 by 23.3% to $1,505,000 from $1,221,000 in 1995 which was an increase of 14.0% over 1994 at $1,071,000. Gross margin on contracts over the last three years have remained relatively stable. As a percent of contract revenues, gross margin increased to 15.3% in 1996 from 14.0% in 1995 which was a decrease from 14.8% in 1994. Contract margins can vary slightly from year to year based on the mix of cost type, firm fixed price and cost share arrangements. Additionally, different fee arrangements and indirect cost absorption can contribute to some margin variability. Research and Development Expenses. ATMI targets areas to maintain its competitive advantage. For 1996, our R&D spending rose significantly to $7,627,000, up 81.3% from last year. Primary drivers for the increase in 1996 was expansion of product development efforts within EcoSys and increased spending to expand and protect the SDS technology portfolio. R&D expenses of $4,206,000 in 1995 was an increase of 23.2% from 1994 R&D of $3,415,000. R&D as a percentage of revenues has increased to 16.5% in 1996, compared with 14.0% in 1995, which was a decrease from 17.3% of revenues in 1994. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Increasing in line with ATMIs growth, ATMIs variable selling costs grew in 1996. ATMI also added administrative staff in 1996 to support revenue growth and incurred increased costs related to the businesses acquired in 1995. As a result, the 1996 S,G&A expenses of $11,510,000, were approximately 34.5% above last years expenses of $8,558,000 which in turn were up 53.2% from 1994 S,G&A expenses of $5,588,000. The growth in 1995 was due again to variable selling cost increases and also to the expansion of the Companys marketing staff. S,G&A as a percentage of revenues has decreased to 24.8% in 1996, compared with 28.5% in 1995, which was a slight increase from 28.3% of revenues in 1994. Other Income, Net. Most of ATMIs other income stems from interest income, offset by interest expense on the Companys outstanding debt. In 1996, net other income grew by 24.8% to $628,000. The Companys invested cash balances throughout 1996 were significantly higher than in 1995 due to the Companys public offering in October 1995. Increased interest expense in 1996 partially offset the effect of the increased interest earned on cash investments. In 1995, net other income of $503,000 grew by 29% from the 1994 amount of $390,000, exclusive of 1994s non recurring transactions. Again the 1995 interest income growth was due to having the proceeds of the October 1995 offering for the last quarter of the year. The 1994 non recurring transaction involved the restructuring of the Novapure joint venture and the sale of assets for a $4.6 million gain. Offsetting this gain were transaction and consolidation expenses of $1 million for the restructuring, acquiring Vector, and combining Vector and Novapure into EcoSys. 20 Income Taxes. ATMIs income tax expense related primarily to state taxes on income generated, partially offset by the utilization of loss carryforwards and available state tax credits. Minimal federal taxes paid in 1996 and 1995 related to alternative minimum taxes arising from the use of net operating loss carryforwards. Income tax expense in 1996 was $239,000, up 78.4% from the $134,000 in 1995 which, in turn, were up 8.5% from $124,000 in 1994. Liquidity and Capital Resources The 1996 year was ATMIs first in generating cash from operations. Net cash generated of $4,280,000 was due principally to the increased profitability of the Company for the year. In 1995, ATMI used net cash for operations of $1,226,000, primarily to fund a significant increase in accounts receivable because of end of the year product shipments. In 1994, $1,342,000 in net cash was used in operations, primarily funding ATMI operating losses. The amount of the Companys working capital has not changed significantly since the closing of the 1995 public offering. Working capital was $27,103,000 at December 31, 1996, compared to $26,224,000 at December 31, 1995. The Companys investing activities include capital expenditures in 1996, 1995, and 1994 of $4,694,000, $3,604,000 and $1,785,000, respectively. The 1996 capital expenditures were primarily focused on manufacturing expansion for EcoSys and NovaMOS and laboratory construction for customer application work for EcoSys. The 1995 and 1994 capital was spent on renovations and leasehold improvements for the Danbury and San Jose facilities, upgrades to the Companys information systems and purchase of laboratory equipment. Among other investing activities for 1996, ATMI sold $4,886,000 in marketable securities and made a $4 million payment in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Guardian. During 1995, ATMI made a $1 million investment in Candescent Technologies Corporation (formerly Silicon Video Corporation), and purchased $11,213,000 of marketable securities with the proceeds received from the 1995 public offering. When the Company restructured Novapure and sold a portion of its assets in 1994, ATMI received net proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. Through the end of 1996, ATMI had used $2.0 million from capital leases in financing capital equipment purchases. Financial institutions have provided collateral based loans for $3.3 million. The State of Connecticut has contributed loans of almost $2.0 million. About $6.6 million was been extended to ATMI by parties to the Companys acquisition activities. At year end, nearly $5.6 million of loans and financing remained outstanding. Notes payable extend through June 2002 with interest rates from 5.4% to 9.5%. ATMI made payments of $1,144,000 on notes payable this year. Last year, notes paid were $741,000, while in 1994, payments totaled $1,050,000. In December 1996, ATMI was extended a $10 million unsecured line of credit by its commercial bank to assist in financing future activities. ATMI believes the cash generated from operations and the proceeds from last years common stock offering together with existing sources of liquidity, will satisfy projected working capital and cash requirements, at least through the end of 1998. However, ATMI believes the level of financial resources available to it is an important competitive factor in its industry and may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period. The Company considers raising additional capital on an on going basis as market factors and its needs suggest. Additionally, ATMI considers, on a continuing basis, potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses complementary to its current business which may require additional cash. 21 Inflation During the last three years, inflation has not had a significant impact on ATMIs operating results.
