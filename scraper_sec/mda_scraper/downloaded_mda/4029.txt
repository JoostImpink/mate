ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Introduction We are an integrated telecommunications services provider offering a portfolio of international and domestic voice, wireless, Internet, voice over Internet protocol (VOIP), data and hosting services to business and residential retail customers and other carriers located primarily in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and western Europe. Our focus is to service the demand for high quality, competitively priced communications services that is being driven by the globalization of the worlds economies, the worldwide trend toward telecommunications deregulation and the growth of broadband, Internet, VOIP, wireless and data traffic. Recent Product Initiatives Overview We have selectively targeted opportunities to participate in major growth areas for telecommunications broadband, local, wireless, and VOIP which we call our new product offerings. These products have been pursued in response to competitive developments described under Four Pronged Action Plan. Our approach in these areas has common elements: focus on bundling services to end user customers; leverage our existing global voice, data, broadband and Internet networks and add network infrastructure in areas of high consumer density; and utilize established distribution channels and back office systems. We continue to devote substantial resources to our new products and the infrastructure and systems necessary to support them. We believe the local services market is a major opportunity for revenue growth. During the third quarter of 2004, we began offering local line service in Canada on a resale basis. In late 2005, we began building our own DSL network infrastructure to provide voice and broadband Internet services to residential customers on such network. We believe that the ability to bundle local services with our core long distance service and new broadband service presents future growth opportunities for us. In Canada we now have 65 nodes installed and approximately 23,000 services (broadband and local voice) on these nodes. The Canadian residential local telephone offering has approximately 79,000 lines in service. We bundle our local services with our other product offerings of long distance voice and Internet access, in competition with incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and cable companies. In 2004 we began building our own DSL network infrastructure in Australia in order to provide bundled voice and broadband Internet services to residential customers on such network. The initial build out of our Australian DSL infrastructure is complete with 181 nodes installed. In Australia, we now have over 150,000 DSL customers. Migration of existing resale local and broadband customers to our network began in the second quarter 2005 and has now reached approximately 66,000 services on net. The target customers for our retail VOIP products will ultimately be anyone who has a broadband connection anywhere in the world. In January 2004, we launched our retail VOIP TalkBroadband&reg; service in Canada. In June 2004, we launched our retail LINGO product in the United States, which offers unlimited calling plans including destinations in Western Europe and certain countries in Asia, unlimited calling between two 37 Table of Contents LINGO subscribers and the issuance of phone numbers that are local for calls originating in certain foreign countries. We have recently launched VOIP services in Australia, Japan and Brazil. Global retail VOIP services are provided to approximately 108,000 customers. For our LINGO product in the United States, since the second half of 2005, we have moderated our advertising due to financial resource limitations and the disruption in marketing activities caused by the emergency 911 regulations. Such action has resulted in a stable to slightly declining customer base which is currently approximately 74,000. It should be recognized that our marketing efforts across our broadband and local initiatives initially increase near term pressure on profitability and cash flow due to migration and installation charges imposed by the incumbent carriers for each customer transferred to our network. The relative impact of such fees, which currently range between $48 per customer in Canada and $105 per customer in Australia, should lessen as the rate of new customer additions becomes a lower percentage of the growing customer base. We are currently awaiting decisions from the regulatory agency in Australia on whether these per customer charges will be reduced and whether there will be a retroactive credit. Until then, we expense these fees at the invoiced rate. In 2006, we incurred $9 million in such fees, and in 2005, we incurred $11 million. With DSL networks now deployed in Canada and Australia we can provision new customers onto our own network and thus avoid migration fees for such customers. We believe that progress to date in transforming the Company beyond its legacy long distance voice and dialup Internet services provider (ISP) businesses through growing our broadband, local, wireless and VOIP businesses has not only strengthened the Company, but has enhanced the competitive positioning and the franchise values of our major operating subsidiaries in Australia and Canada. We have also focused on our European and United States retail operations and significant progress has been made in eliminating low margin services and associated costs, in reducing selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and in tightening our focus on areas of profitable growth. Four Pronged Action Plan in 2006 Our fundamental challenge continues to be generating sufficient sales volume from new product offerings in broadband, local, wireless and VOIP services to offset the declining contribution from our legacy long distance voice and dial up ISP businesses. To address this challenge, we have pursued our four pronged action plan (Action Plan): first, to drive strong revenue growth from new products and to concentrate resources on the most promising initiatives (as discussed within Recent Product Initiatives Overview); second, to enhance margin by increasing scale on the new products and by investing in broadband infrastructure in high density locations as well as migrating customers onto our network (as discussed within Recent Product Initiatives Overview); third, to continue cost cutting and cost management programs partially to offset margin erosion caused by the continued decline of our high margin legacy retail revenues; and fourth, to strengthen the balance sheet through potential deleveraging and equity capital infusion on a prudent basis. Revenue from broadband, local, wireless and VOIP initiatives grew to $134 million in 2006, an increase of 51% from 2005. In addition to consistent quarterly revenue growth from new services, profitability from these services is also increasing, providing clear support for our Action Plan. Also, we now have over 192,000 DSL customers in Australia and Canada. The Australian and Canadian DSLAM networks are comprised of 181 and 65 nodes, respectively. There are now over 103,000 services (local and broadband) provisioned directly on the Companys DSLAM facilities in Australia and Canada. Margins from these on net services are almost double those of off net services. Our 2006 operating results continue to reflect increased competition from product bundling in virtually all of our markets; product substitution (e.g., wireless for fixed line; broadband for dial up Internet); declining usage patterns for traditional fixed line voice services as use of wireless, e mail and instant messaging services expands; and continued competitive pricing pressures. As a result, our revenue growth and profitability have been strongly challenged by a changing industry environment. 38 Table of Contents After four consecutive quarters of reduced SG&A expense, SG&A expenses decreased $91.5 million from $379.1 million in 2005 to $287.6 million in 2006. Our aggressive expense reduction efforts, which included a reduction in commissions from curtailed prepaid services, also focused on a range of cost of revenue reductions in 2006 and such efforts are continuing. Additionally, the Australian regulatory commission issued an Interim Determination Letter lowering charges for on net local loop services, which is one of the regulatory matters currently under review. If this interim ruling is affirmed, it is estimated that our annual expense for these services will be reduced by approximately $2 million. The fourth element of our Action Plan is to strengthen the balance sheet through deleveraging and capital infusion. In 2006 we successfully: (1) exchanged $27 million principal amount of the 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2007 for $27 million of newly created Step Up Convertible Debentures due 2009; (2) exchanged $3 million principal amount of the 12.75% Senior Notes for 1.8 million shares of common stock; (3) exchanged $32 million principal amount of 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes for $55 million principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010; (4) issued $24 million principal amount of 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes for $18 million in cash (net of issuance costs); (5) raised $13 million cash proceeds from the sale of our Indian subsidiary; and (6) sold $5 million of newly issued common stock to a private investor (see events described below under Short and Long Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks). Transformation Strategy in 2007 With the substantial progress made in 2006, we are now positioned to embark on a two year Transformation Strategy to strengthen significantly our balance sheet, resume top line revenue growth before the end of 2008, and re list on NASDAQ. While this is an admittedly aggressive set of goals, given the successful execution on multiple operational and financial initiatives over the past year with constrained resources, we have confidence that these are reasonable goals. Key elements of our two year Transformation Strategy are as follows: Strengthen the balance sheet opportunistically through potential de levering transactions and equity capital infusions. Significantly improve our non sales and marketing cost structure through increased outsourcing and or off shoring at lower cost locations globally; improve coordination among PRIMUS business units to deliver synergy savings; and maintain an aggressive cost management program. Re deploying the resultant savings back into sales and marketing activities with attractive payback parameters should, in turn, increase margins. Focus on improving sales productivity and margin enhancements by leveraging our network assets and increasing the revenue mix in favor of higher margin growth services. Opportunistically sell non strategic assets and businesses and use the proceeds either to accelerate growth of high margin businesses or to strengthen the balance sheet. Our strategy for 2007 and beyond is unchanged maintain a narrow focus, invest wisely and tightly control costs. While revenue may decline year over year, as we continue to prune low margin, unprofitable revenue streams, our objective is to improve cash flows by 10% or more over 2006, recognizing seasonal fluctuations in quarterly performance. At that level of cash flows (which assumes stable currency exchange rates throughout 2007 and excludes any material expenses related to further restructuring) and with our current cash position and our completed 2007 debt transactions, we believe our 2007 business plan is fully funded. Overview of Operations Generally, we price our services competitively with the major carriers and service providers operating in our principal service regions. We seek to generate net revenue through sales and marketing efforts focused on 39 Table of Contents customers with significant communications needs (international and domestic voice, wireless, VOIP, high speed and Internet and data), including small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), multinational corporations, residential customers, and other telecommunications carriers and resellers and through acquisitions. Long distance voice minutes of use per customer continue to decline as more customers are using wireless devices and the Internet as alternatives to the use of wireline phones. Also, product substitution (e.g., wireless/Internet for fixed line voice; broadband for dial up ISP services) has resulted in revenue declines in our legacy long distance voice and dial up ISP businesses. Additionally, we believe that because deregulatory influences have begun to affect telecommunications markets outside the United States, the deregulatory trend will result in greater competition from the existing wireline and wireless competitors and from new entrants, such as cable companies and VOIP companies, which could continue to affect adversely our net revenue per minute, as well as minutes of use. As the portion of traffic transmitted over leased or owned facilities increases, cost of revenue increasingly is comprised of fixed costs. In order to manage such costs, we pursue a flexible approach with respect to the expansion of our network capacity. In most instances, we initially obtain transmission capacity on a variable cost, per minute leased basis, then acquire additional capacity on a fixed cost basis when traffic volume makes such a commitment cost effective, and ultimately purchase and operate our own facilities when traffic levels justify such investment. We also seek to lower the cost of revenue through: optimizing the cost of traffic by using the least expensive cost routing; negotiating lower variable usage based costs with domestic and foreign service providers and negotiating additional and lower cost foreign carrier agreements with the foreign incumbent carriers and others; continuing to expand/reduce the capacity of our network when traffic volumes justify such actions; and increasing use of the public Internet. Overall, carrier revenue accounted for 21% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. The provision of carrier services also allows us to connect our network to all major carriers, which enables us to provide global coverage. Our overall margin may fluctuate based on the relative volumes of international versus domestic long distance services; carrier services versus business and residential long distance services; prepaid services versus traditional post paid voice services; Internet, VOIP and data services versus fixed line voice services; the amount of services that are resold; and the proportion of traffic carried on our network versus resale of other carriers services. Our margin is also affected by customer transfer and migration fees. We pay a charge to install and transfer a new customer onto our network, and to migrate DSL and local customers. However, installing and migrating customers to our own networks, such as the DSL networks in Australia and Canada, enable us to increase our margin on such services as compared to resale of services using other carriers networks. SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits, commissions, occupancy costs, sales and marketing expenses, advertising, professional fees, and administrative costs. All SG&A expenses are expensed when incurred. Foreign Currency Foreign currency can have a major impact on our financial results. Currently in excess of 81% of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the United States. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the USD. The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country. In the future, we expect to continue to derive the majority of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs from outside the United States, and therefore changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially adverse, 40 Table of Contents effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates: USD/CAD, USD/AUD, USD/GBP, and USD/EUR. Due to the large percentage of our revenue derived outside of the United States, changes in the USD relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations. We have agreements with certain subsidiaries for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to these subsidiaries. As we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future, we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. We historically have not engaged in hedging transactions. However, the exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies. We are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries. We translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into USD using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year. By way of example, when the USD strengthens compared to the EUR, there could be a negative or positive effect on the reported results for Europe, depending upon whether Europe is operating profitably or at a loss. It takes more profits in EUR to generate the same amount of profits in USD and a greater loss in EUR to generate the same amount of loss in USD. The opposite is also true. For instance, when the USD weakens there is a positive effect on reported profits and a negative effect on the reported losses for Europe. In the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, the USD was weaker on average as compared to the CAD, EUR and GBP and stronger on average as compared to the AUD. The following tables demonstrate the impact of currency fluctuations on our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands, except percentages): Net Revenue by Location in USD 2006 Net Revenue 2005 Net Revenue Variance Variance % Canada $ 275,546 $ 261,511 $ 14,035 5 % Australia $ 305,718 $ 344,218 $ (38,500 ) (11 )% United Kingdom $ 84,397 $ 113,859 $ (29,462 ) (26 )% Europe * $ 138,064 $ 224,324 $ (86,260 ) (38 )% Revenue by Country in Local Currencies 2006 Net Revenue 2005 Net Revenue Variance Variance % Canada (in CAD) 312,671 316,662 (3,991 ) (1 )% Australia (in AUD) 406,451 451,298 (44,847 ) (10 )% United Kingdom (in GBP) 45,940 61,999 (16,059 ) (26 )% Europe * (in EUR) 110,717 181,029 (70,312 ) (39 )% * Europe includes only subsidiaries whose functional currency is the EUR. Recent Operating Highlights and Other Events In order to better understand our discussion of results of operations, financial condition and liquidity presented herein, we refer you to Item I Business Operating Highlights and Accomplishments concerning certain operating highlights and other events. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies To aid in the understanding of our financial reporting, our most critical accounting policies are described below. These policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements, either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate, or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Net revenue is derived from carrying a mix of business, residential and carrier long distance traffic, data and Internet traffic, and also from the provision of local and wireless services. For voice and wholesale VOIP, net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call and is recorded upon completion of a call, adjusted for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, service credits and service adjustments. Revenue for a period is calculated from information received through our network switches. Customized software has been designed to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates. This software provides us the ability to do a timely and accurate analysis of revenue earned in a period. Separate prepaid services software is used to track additional information related to prepaid service usage such as activation date, monthly usage amounts, fees and charges, and expiration date. Revenue on these prepaid services is recognized as service is provided until expiration when all unused minutes, which are no longer available to the customers, are recognized as revenue. Net revenue is also earned on a fixed monthly fee basis for unlimited local and long distance plans and for the provision of data/Internet services (including retail VOIP). Data/Internet services include monthly fees collected for the provision of dedicated and dial up access at various speeds and bandwidths. These fees are recognized as access is provided on a monthly basis. Additionally, service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized over the longer of the average customer life or the contract term. We record payments received in advance for prepaid services and services to be provided under contractual agreements, such as Internet broadband and dial up access, as deferred revenue until such related services are provided. A portion of revenue, representing less than 1% of total revenue, is earned from the sale of wireless handsets and VOIP routers. We apply the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which provides guidance on when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting. We have concluded that EITF No. 00 21 requires us to account for the sale of wireless handsets and VOIP routers and the related cost of handset and router revenues as a separate unit of accounting when title to the handset or router passes to the customer. Revenue recognized is the portion of the activation fees allocated to the router or handset unit of accounting in the statement of operations when title to the router or handset passes to the customer. We defer the portion of the activation fees allocated to the service unit of accounting, and recognize such deferred fees on a straight line basis over the contract life in the statement of operations. Net revenue represents gross revenue, net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, service credits and service adjustments. Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable Determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates. Due to the large number of customers that we serve, it is impractical to review the creditworthiness of each of our customers, although a credit review is performed for larger carrier and retail business customers. We consider a number of factors in determining the proper level of the allowance, including historical collection experience, current economic trends, the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers. Systems to detect fraudulent call activity are in place within our network, but if these systems fail to identify such activity, we may realize a higher degree of uncollectible accounts. If the estimate of uncollectible revenue was 10% higher than our current estimates, net revenue would have been reduced by approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. 42 Table of Contents Cost of revenue Cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs incurred from other domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers to originate, transport and terminate calls. The majority of our cost of revenue is variable, based upon the number of minutes of use, with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense. Call activity is tracked and analyzed with customized software that analyzes the traffic flowing through our network switches and calculates the variable cost of revenue with predetermined contractual rates. If the domestic or foreign telecommunications carriers have tracked and invoiced the volume of minutes at levels different than what our activity shows or have invoiced at different rates, we will dispute the charges invoiced. There is no guarantee that we will prevail in such disputes. We use significant estimates to determine the level of success in dispute resolution and consider past historical experience, basis of dispute, financial status and current relationship with vendor, and aging of prior disputes in quantifying our estimates. Valuation of long lived assets We review intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In making such evaluations, we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets. We make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain, such as determining asset groups and estimating future cash flows, remaining useful lives, discount rates and growth rates. The resulting undiscounted cash flows are projected over an extended period of time, which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable, different assumptions could materially affect the valuation of the long lived assets. During 2006, we completed an evaluation of our expected future cash flows compared to the carrying value of our assets based on estimates of our expected results of operations. We derive future cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans, which include consideration of industry trends, competitive actions, technology changes, regulatory actions, available financial resources for marketing and capital expenditures and changes in our underlying cost structure. Although we believe our estimates to be reasonable, if future cash flow estimates were reduced 5%, then our estimated fair value of the long lived assets and the indefinite lived intangible assets, in aggregate, would have been reduced by approximately $7 million. We have concluded that we have one asset group; the network. This is due to the nature of our telecommunications network which utilizes all of the POPs, switches, cables and various other components throughout the network to form seamlessly the telecommunications gateway over which our products and services are carried for any given customers phone call or data or Internet transmission. Furthermore, outflows to many of the external network providers are not separately assignable to revenue inflows for any phone call or service plan. We make assumptions about the remaining useful life of our long lived assets. The assumptions are based on the average life of our historical capital asset additions, our historical asset purchase trend and that our primary assets, our network switches, have an 8 year life. Because of the nature of our industry, we also assume that the technology changes in the industry render all equipment obsolete with no salvage value after their useful lives. In certain circumstances in which the underlying assets could be leased for an additional period of time, we have included such estimated cash flows in our estimate. If we had projected that the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets were one half year shorter, then our estimated fair value of the long lived assets and the indefinite lived intangible assets, in aggregate, would have been reduced by approximately $12 million. The estimate of the appropriate discount rate to be used to apply the present value technique in determining fair value was our weighted average cost of capital which is based on the effective rate of our long term debt obligations at the current market values as well as the current volatility and trading value of our common stock. If we had projected the discount rate to be 500 basis points higher, then our estimated fair value of the long lived assets and the indefinite lived intangible assets, in aggregate, would have been approximately $15 million less. 43 Table of Contents Valuation of goodwill Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually (October 1 for Primus) for impairment, or more frequently, if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets that have finite lives will be amortized over their useful lives and are subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets is also triggered by the performance of a SFAS No. 144 analysis. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as each segments components have been aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics. Each component is similar in that they each provide telecommunications services for which all of the resources and costs are drawn from the same pool, and are evaluated using the same business factors by management. Furthermore, segment management measures results and allocates resources for the segment as a whole and utilizes country by country financials for statutory reporting purposes. Goodwill impairment is tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit. The first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount. In estimating fair value of our reporting units, we compare market capitalization of our common stock, distributed between the reporting units based on adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) projections, to the equivalent carrying value (total assets less total liabilities) of such reporting unit. When our carrying value of a reporting unit is a negative value, we proceed to use alternative valuation techniques. These techniques include comparing total fair value of invested capital, distributed between the reporting units based on adjusted EBITDA projections, to the equivalent carrying value (book equity plus book long term obligations). The carrying value of each reporting unit includes an allocation of the corporate invested capital based on relative size of the reporting units intercompany payables and invested capital. Using our adjusted EBITDA projections is a judgment item that can significantly affect the outcome of the analysis, both in basing the allocation on the most relevant time period as well as in allocating fair value between reporting units. Accounting for income taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. If necessary, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to an amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable. We must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance. In addition, tax contingency reserves (if any) are established or released based on assumptions about the expected outcomes of current or anticipated tax examinations, refund claims and or tax related litigation and estimates regarding additional tax liability (including interest and penalties thereon) or refunds resulting therefrom. At present, our subsidiaries in the major jurisdictions in which we operate have significant deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards. With the exception of our Canadian companies, these deferred tax assets are fully offset with valuation allowances. The appropriateness and amount of these valuation allowances are based on our assumptions about the future taxable income of each affiliate. Except in the case of our Canadian companies, if our assumptions have significantly underestimated future taxable income with respect to a particular affiliate, all or part of the valuation allowance for the affiliate would be reversed and additional income may result. With the exception of our Canadian affiliates, if our assumptions have significantly overestimated future taxable income with respect to a particular affiliate, there would be no change in the net value of the deferred tax asset and no additional income or tax expense would result. If our assumptions with respect to our Canadian affiliates have significantly overestimated future taxable income, a full or partial valuation allowance would be applied to the corresponding deferred tax assets and additional tax expense would result. 44 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In May 2006, we completed a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), a leading international telecommunications company and member of the TATA Group, whereby VSNL purchased 100% of the stock of Direct Internet Limited (DIL), whose wholly owned subsidiary, Primus Telecommunications India Limited (PTIL), was primarily engaged in providing fixed broadband wireless Internet services to enterprise and retail customers in India. We owned approximately 85% of the stock of DIL through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. The remaining approximately 15% of the stock of DIL was owned by the manager of DIL and PTIL, who had founded the predecessor companies. The total purchase consideration was $17.5 million. We received $13.0 million in net cash proceeds from the transaction at closing on June 23, 2006, after closing adjustments. The net assets of DIL were $8.9 million at June 23, 2006. As a result of the sale, our consolidated financial statements reflect India operations as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

The decrease is primarily 46 Table of Contents attributed to a decrease of $24.5 million in retail voice services (including declines in residential and small business voice services and prepaid services), a decrease of $3.0 million in Internet services, a decrease of $1.0 million in wireless services which was partially offset by an increase of $10.2 million in carrier services and $6.9 million in retail VOIP. Canada: Canada net revenue increased $14.0 million or 5.4% to $275.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $261.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of $21.8 million in revenue from new products, which include local, VOIP, broadband Internet, and wireless services, and a $2.0 million increase in prepaid services, which was partially offset by a decrease of $9.2 million in retail voice services. The strengthening of the CAD against the USD accounted for a $17.6 million increase to revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

We continue to shed certain low margin revenue while growing revenue from our new services. Additionally service install and migration fees in Canada and Australia were less than the prior year period as fewer customers from other carriers were migrated on net in Australia and Canada. United States: United States cost of revenue increased $1.3 million primarily due to an increase of $12.8 million in carrier services and an increase of $1.1 million in VOIP services. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8.8 million in retail voice services, a decrease of $1.8 million in prepaid services, a decrease of $1.7 million for Internet services and a decrease of $0.9 million in wireless services. Canada: Canada cost of revenue increased $4.6 million primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in new products, which include local, VOIP and wireless services and customer migration fees and $2.3 million in Internet services. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in retail voice services of $5.2 million. The strengthening of the CAD against the USD accounted for an $8.2 million increase to cost of revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Europe: European cost of revenue decreased by $95.9 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $62.1 million decrease in low margin prepaid services including a decrease of $42.6 million in Netherlands, $15.1 million in the UK and $4.4 million in Sweden. Low margin carrier services decreased $29.8 million primarily due to an $11.3 million decrease in the UK, a $9.4 million decrease in Italy, a $3.8 million decrease in Germany, a $2.9 million decrease in Denmark and a $2.4 million decrease in France. Wireless services decreased $5.0 million primarily in the UK.

Asia Pacific: Asia Pacific cost of revenue decreased $25.9 million primarily due to a decrease of $18.9 million in residential voice services, a decrease of $12.5 million of dial up Internet services, a decrease of $3.9 million in business services and a decrease of $2.8 million in carrier services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $10.8 million for new DSL services including customer migration fees and an increase of 48 Table of Contents $2.0 million in VOIP and other services. Weakening of the AUD against the USD accounted for a $3.1 million decrease to cost of revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $91.5 million to $287.6 million, or 28.4% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $379.1 million, or 32.2% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable to a decrease of $41.0 million in sales and marketing expenses primarily for agent commissions related to prepaid services, a decrease of $21.9 million in salaries and benefits, a decrease of $12.3 million in advertising expenses for new products, a decrease of $7.1 million in professional fees, a decrease of $6.0 million for general and administrative expenses, a decrease of $1.8 million in travel and entertainment and a decrease of $1.4 million in occupancy expenses. United States: United States selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $33.2 million to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $96.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $11.1 million in advertising expenses primarily attributable to LINGO, a decrease of $6.7 million in salaries and benefits expense due to cost cutting/staff reduction efforts which is net of $0.3 million of related severance expense in 2006, a decrease of $6.3 million in sales and marketing expense primarily for agent commissions related to low margin prepaid services, a decrease of $6.1 million in professional fees which includes savings related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and consulting support of the LINGO and wireless businesses, a decrease of $1.8 million in general and administrative expenses and a decrease of $1.2 million in occupancy and travel and entertainment expenses. Canada: Canada selling, general and administrative expense increased $0.7 million to $98.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $97.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is attributable to an increase of $3.3 million in advertising, an increase of $1.2 million in professional fees and an increase of $0.6 million in occupancy and travel and entertainment expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in sales and marketing expense, a decrease of $1.3 million in salaries which reflects $0.9 million of severance expense in 2006 and a decrease of $1.0 million in general and administrative expenses. Europe: Europe selling, general and administrative expense decreased $43.6 million to $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $32.8 million in sales and marketing expense primarily for agent commissions related to low margin prepaid services, a decrease of $4.5 million in salaries and benefits expense which reflects $1.1 million of severance expense in 2006, a decrease of $2.3 million in professional fees, a decrease of $1.4 million in travel and entertainment expenses, a decrease of $1.4 million in general and administrative expenses and a decrease of $1.2 million in occupancy expenses and advertising. Asia Pacific: Asia Pacific selling, general and administrative expense decreased $15.5 million to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $9.3 million in salaries and benefits expense which reflects $0.3 million of severance expense in 2006, a decrease of $4.4 million in advertising and a decrease of $1.8 million in general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $39.1 million to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $86.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease consisted of a decrease in depreciation expense of $27.6 million and a decrease in amortization expense of $11.5 million. The decrease is primarily due to the asset impairment recognized in the second quarter 2006. Gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets was a loss of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We recognized a charge associated with the sale or disposal of specific long lived assets which were taken out of 49 Table of Contents service. The charge includes $8.9 million in the United States, $2.2 million in the United Kingdom, $2.0 million in Japan, $1.8 million in Canada and $1.2 million in various other countries and is comprised of network fiber, peripheral switch equipment, software development costs and other network equipment. Loss on disposal of assets was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. We recognized a charge associated with the disposal of specific long lived assets which were taken out of service. The charge included $8.9 million in the United Kingdom, $3.1 million in the United States, $1.3 million in Germany and $0.1 million in Spain and was comprised of network fiber, peripheral switch equipment, software development costs and other network equipment. Asset impairment write down was $209.2 million for 2006. During the second quarter 2006, the Company adjusted the carrying value of its long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value of $108.7 million and $34.9 million, respectively. The $209.2 million write down consists of a write down of $151.8 million in property and equipment, $5.3 million in customer lists and other intangible assets, and $52.1 million in goodwill under the provisions of SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No. 142. Interest expense, including accretion of debt discount, increased $2.5 million to $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is the result of $8.2 million from changes in the variable interest rate of our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the issuance of our $27.5 million Step Up Convertible Subordinated Debentures and capital leases. This is offset by a $5.7 million decrease due to interest saved from exchanges of $56.3 million of 2003 Convertible Subordinated Debentures, and $2.5 million of October 1999 Senior Notes, deferred offering costs amortization changes and other interest. Change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt was a gain of $5.4 million for the year ended 2006. Our Step Up Convertible Subordinated Debentures, 2000 Convertible Subordinated Debentures and 2003 Convertible Senior Notes contained embedded derivatives that required bifurcation from the debt host from February 27 to June 20, 2006. We recognized these embedded derivatives as a current liability in our balance sheet, measured them at their estimated fair value and recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings. We estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of 100% as of June 20, 2006. On June 20, 2006, the embedded derivatives no longer qualified for bifurcation. We estimated that the embedded derivatives had a June 20, 2006 (the final valuation date) fair value of $10.3 million and at March 31, 2006, an estimated fair value of $13.1 million. The embedded derivatives derived their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock. The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives decreased as the price of our common stock decreased. The closing price of our common stock decreased to $0.64 on June 20, 2006 from $0.88 on February 27, 2006, causing the overall value of the derivative instrument to decline. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a gain of $5.4 million from the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives. Gain on early extinguishment or restructuring of debt was $7.4 million for the year ended 2006. In June 2006, we exchanged $54.8 million principal amount of the Companys 2003 Convertible Senior Notes and $20.5 million of cash for $56.3 million principal amount of PTHIs 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes and $11.3 million of future cash payments resulting in a gain on restructuring of debt of $4.8 million including the expensing of related financing costs. In March 2006, we exchanged $27.4 million principal amount of our 2000 Convertible Subordinated Debentures for $27.5 million principal amount of our 2006 Step Up Convertible Subordinated Debentures resulting in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million including the write off of related deferred financing costs. In January 2006, we exchanged 1,825,000 shares of our common stock for the extinguishment of $2.5 million in principal amount of the October 1999 Senior Notes resulting in a $1.2 million gain on early extinguishment of debt including the write off of related deferred financing costs. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) was a gain of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to a loss of ($17.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The gain or loss is attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on intercompany debt balances and on receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currency. 50 Table of Contents Income tax expense increased to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The expense for both periods primarily consists of foreign withholding tax on intercompany interest and royalty fees owed to our United States subsidiaries by our Canadian and Australian subsidiaries. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 Net revenue decreased $163.3 million or 12.2% to $1,176.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $1,339.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 for the reasons described below. Our data/Internet and VOIP revenue contributed $182.3 million and $88.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $174.1 million and $63.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. United States: United States net revenue decreased $40.4 million or 16.3% to $207.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $247.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily attributed to a decrease of $33.7 million in retail voice services (including declines in residential and small business voice services and prepaid services), a decrease of $23.1 million in carrier services and a $4.7 million decrease in Internet services which was partially offset by an increase of $20.1 million in retail VOIP and an increase of $1.1 million in wireless services. Canada: Canada net revenue increased $17.4 million or 7.1% to $261.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $244.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase of $30.4 million in new products, which include local, VOIP and wireless services, an $11.2 million increase in prepaid services, and a $10.7 million increase in Internet services (mainly due to the April 2004 acquisition of Magma Communications Ltd. (Magma)), which was partially offset by a decrease of $34.4 million in retail voice services. The strengthening of the CAD against the USD accounted for a $17.9 million increase to revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of $104.5 million in prepaid services in the UK, a $21.7 million decrease in retail voice services, a $1.9 million decrease in wireless services, and a $0.8 million decrease in Internet and other services, partially offset by an increase in prepaid services of $24.2 million in the Netherlands and $3.9 million in Sweden and an increase of $2.0 million in carrier services. The European prepaid services business declined primarily in the UK due to a UK court decision regarding the application of VAT which favored our competitors and made PRIMUS products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint. As of the first half of 2005, we no longer operate a prepaid service business in the UK, but rather are a support service provider through a wholesale relationship. During the second quarter 2005 we launched prepaid services operations in new geographic markets. The restructuring of the prepaid services business in the UK also reduced the collectibility of our receivables and resulted in a $2.5 million write down of receivables. The weakening of the European currencies against the USD accounted for a $1.4 million decrease to revenue, which is included in the above explanation, and which reflects 51 Table of Contents changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.

The decrease is primarily attributable to a $32.8 million decrease in residential voice services, a $32.3 million decrease in dial up Internet services, an $8.2 million decrease in business voice services, and a $3.5 million decrease in prepaid services, partially offset by a $32.0 million increase in new Australia DSL services, and a $3.3 million increase in carrier services.

We continue to experience a shift from higher margin legacy long distance voice and dial up Internet revenues to new product sets that include bundled services and lower margin prepaid and resold services. We are also experiencing significant pressure on our margins with the increased customer and service migration fees in Canada and Australia. United States: United States cost of revenue decreased $25.8 million primarily due to a decrease of $22.6 million in carrier services, a decrease of $12.0 million in retail voice services, a decrease of $3.1 million for prepaid services and a decrease of $2.6 million for Internet services. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $13.1 million in VOIP services, and an increase of $1.4 million in wireless services, as these businesses expand further. Canada: Canada cost of revenue increased $20.9 million primarily due to an increase of $25.3 million in new products, which include local, VOIP and wireless services and customer migration fees, $5.7 million in prepaid services and $3.9 million in Internet services. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in retail 52 Table of Contents voice services of $13.5 million. The strengthening of the CAD against the USD accounted for a $7.4 million increase to cost of revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Europe: European cost of revenue decreased by $26.6 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $26.9 million decrease in prepaid services including a decrease of $62.9 million in the UK, offset by increases of $32.0 million in the Netherlands and $4.0 million in Sweden. Retail voice decreased $5.3 million primarily in Austria and the UK. These decreases were offset by increases of $3.4 million in carrier services primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in Germany, a $5.6 million increase in Italy, a $1.4 million increase in Spain, and an increase of $0.7 million in France, offset by a $10.1 million decrease in the UK. The weakening of the European currencies against the USD accounted for a $1.5 million decrease to cost of revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia Pacific: Asia Pacific cost of revenue decreased $4.4 million primarily due to a decrease of $11.6 million in residential voice services, a decrease of $9.6 million of Internet services, a decrease of $2.8 million in business services, and a decrease of $2.3 million in prepaid services. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $19.1 million for DSL services including customer migration fees, and an increase of $2.8 million for carrier services. Strengthening of the AUD against the USD accounted for an $8.1 million increase to cost of revenue, which is included in the services explanation above, and which reflects changes in the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.3 million to $379.1 million, or 32.2% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $392.4 million, or 29.3% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is attributable to a decrease of $22.0 million in sales and marketing expenses primarily for agent commissions, a decrease of $5.6 million in advertising expenses for new products, and a decrease of $2.3 million for general and administrative expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $8.8 million in salaries and benefits which reflects $3.5 million of severance expense and additional spending for VOIP, local, broadband and wireless initiatives, a $6.3 million increase in professional fees which includes efforts related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and consulting support of the LINGO and wireless businesses, and an increase of $1.5 million in occupancy. United States: United States selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million to $96.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $3.2 million in salaries and benefits expense due to cost cutting/staff reduction efforts which is net of $1.4 million of related severance expenses, a decrease of $1.2 million in sales and marketing expense primarily for agent commissions, and a decrease of $0.8 million in advertising expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in professional fees which includes efforts related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance and consulting support of the LINGO and wireless businesses, and an increase of $0.8 million in occupancy. Canada: Canada selling, general and administrative expense increased $7.2 million to $97.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is attributable to an increase of $8.9 million in salaries and benefits expense which reflects $0.8 million of severance expense and additional spending for new products, and an increase of $1.4 million in professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in advertising expenses. Europe: Europe selling, general and administrative expense decreased $16.1 million to $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $20.1 million in sales and marketing expense primarily for agent commissions 53 Table of Contents related to prepaid services. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.5 million in professional fees, an increase of $1.2 million in general and administrative expenses and an increase of $1.2 million in salaries and benefits expense which reflects $0.4 million of severance expense. Asia Pacific: Asia Pacific selling, general and administrative expense decreased $3.5 million to $95.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $98.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is attributable to a decrease of $3.0 million in general and administrative expenses, and a decrease of $1.6 million in advertising expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.1 million in salaries and benefits expense which reflects $0.9 million of severance expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $5.1 million to $86.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease consisted of a decrease in amortization expense of $3.5 million and a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.5 million as assets become fully depreciated. Loss on sale or disposal of assets was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. We recognized a charge associated with the disposal of specific long lived assets which were taken out of service. The charge included $8.5 million in the United Kingdom, $3.1 million in the United States, $1.3 million in Germany and $0.1 million in Spain and was comprised of network fiber, peripheral switch equipment, software development costs and other network equipment. The charge also included $0.4 million of wireless handset development costs in the United Kingdom determined to be obsolete. Loss on sale of disposal of assets was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss was primarily the result of a sale of network equipment which was decommissioned when it was replaced by newer technology during the three months ended June 30, 2004. Asset impairment write down was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $1.6 million impairment consisted of specific long lived asset write offs which included $0.6 million of networking equipment and $0.9 million of leasehold improvements on a vacated property in the United States. Interest expense increased $2.9 million to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase is the result of $8.8 million in interest from our February 2005 senior secured term loan facility, offset by $5.9 million in interest saved from the reduction of senior debt and other refinancing arrangements. Gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt was ($1.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The ($1.7) million loss resulted from the exchange of our common stock for the extinguishment of $17.0 million in principal amount of the 2000 Convertible Subordinated Debentures and $8.6 million in principal amount of the October 1999 Senior Notes including the write off of deferred financing costs. The ($11.0) million loss in the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted of $10.0 million in premium payments related to our purchase of $194.5 million in principal amount of senior notes and a $3.1 million write off of deferred financing costs; a $1.0 million gain related to our purchase of $4.0 million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures, prior to maturity; and a $1.1 million gain on the settlement of a $6.1 million outstanding payment obligation from the acquisition of Cable & Wireless United States based retail switched voice services customer bases. Interest and other income decreased $9.0 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the release of a provision for a tax assessment in the year ended December 31, 2004, including interest and penalties, related to a business acquisition in March 1999. In August 2004, we were released from the tax assessment in its entirety and recorded a $9.2 million gain. Foreign currency transaction gain (loss) was a loss of ($17.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to a gain of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss is attributable to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on intercompany debt balances and on receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currency. 54 Table of Contents Income tax expense decreased to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The expense for both periods primarily consists of foreign withholding tax on intercompany interest and royalty fees owed to our United States subsidiary by our Canadian and Australian subsidiaries, and the decrease is due to lower interest and fees. Liquidity and Capital Resources Changes in Cash Flows Our principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, purchases of network equipment including switches, related transmission equipment and capacity, DSL network build out, development of back office systems, interest and principal payments on outstanding debt and other obligations, withholding taxes and acquisitions. We have financed our growth and operations to date through public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities, vendor financing, capital lease financing and other financing arrangements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net loss, net of non cash operating activity, provided $19.9 million of cash. In addition, cash was increased by a reduction in accounts receivable of $14.8 million, increases in deferred revenue, accrued expenses, accrued income taxes and other liabilities of $3.8 million, and a reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $9.4 million. In 2006, we used $36.6 million to reduce our accounts payable and accrued interconnection costs. During the year ended December 31, 2005, cash was increased by reductions in accounts receivable of $19.3 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.1 million as prepaid balances, inventories and non trade receivables were reduced. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net loss, net of non cash operating activity, used $19.0 million of cash. In addition, we used $46.1 million to reduce our accounts payable and accrued interconnection costs, $7.4 million to reduce our accrued expenses, accrued interest, accrued income tax and other liabilities and $1.6 million to increase other assets. Net cash used by investing activities was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 included $33.0 million of capital expenditures primarily for additions to our DSL networks in Australia and Canada and back office support systems, offset by a $2.4 million decrease in restricted cash and $12.9 million net cash proceeds from the disposition of our India operations. Net cash used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 included $49.8 million of capital expenditures primarily for additions to our global network, especially the Australian DSL network, and back office support systems, offset by a $5.8 million decrease in restricted cash. Net cash provided by financing activities was $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $32.4 million from the issuance of $24.1 million 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes for $17.7 million in cash, net of $2.9 million in financing costs, and the issuance of $14.8 million through an amended and restated loan facility with a Canadian financial institution, net of $0.2 million in financing costs; $5.0 million from the sale of 6.7 million shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement with an existing stockholder; partially offset by $11.9 million of principal payments on capital leases, leased fiber capacity, financing facilities and other long term obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $97.0 million from the issuance of our $100 million senior secured term loan facility, net of $3.0 million in financing costs, and $12.8 million issued through the loan agreement with a Canadian financial institution; partially offset by $20.3 million of principal payments on capital leases, leased fiber capacity, financing facilities and other long term obligations. 55 Table of Contents Short and Long Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks As of December 31, 2006, we had $64.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our 2007 operations and completed financing transactions, will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements, the repayment of the 2000 Convertible Subordinated Debentures and other fixed obligations (such as capital leases, vendor financing and other long term obligations), and other cash needs for our operations for the next twelve months. We have successfully executed a number of liquidity enhancing initiatives that enabled us to fund both our 2006 and 2007 business plans and to meet our debt maturity obligations in February 2007. These initiatives included the following transactions: (1) the sale of Primus India for $13.0 million in net cash proceeds in 2006; (2) private debt exchanges and issuances involving new 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes that raised $20.5 million in cash without materially increasing the amount of total debt in 2006; (3) raising $5.0 million in equity in 2006; (4) in 2007, two private sales of $75.2 million principal amount of new 14 1/4% Second Lien Notes for cash, and the accompanying private exchange of an additional $33.0 million principal amount of 14 1/4% Second Lien Notes for $40.7 million principal amount of existing 12.75% Senior Notes; (5) financing and refinancing arrangements with fiber and equipment vendors in 2006 and 2007; (6) the sale of a business unit in Australia for approximately $6 million in net cash proceeds in 2007; and (7) the refinancing of the existing Canadian credit facility in 2007. Our high margin broadband, VOIP, mobile and local service initiatives are performing well. They have reached an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $140 million, having experienced a 52% year over year increase in revenue in 2006. We are pleased with that performance but also believe that our potential for growth is much higher in these services with greater investment than is currently available to us. Tapping that full potential will require a greater investment in sales and marketing over the next two years. Such an investment seems fully justified given our clear need for revenue and profitability growth from these services to compensate for the corresponding declines from our high margin legacy long distance voice and dial up Internet businesses. This remains managements primary challenge, and improvements in this area are closely linked to our ability to enhance operating performance in order to access growth capital needed to realize our full potential. We will continue to have significant debt service obligations during the next year and on a long term basis. Also there can be no assurance that changes in assumptions or conditions, including those referenced under Legal Proceedings and Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements will not adversely affect our financial condition or short term or long term liquidity. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, we have $6.2 million in future minimum purchase obligations, $41.0 million in future operating lease payments and $644.1 million of indebtedness. Payments of principal and interest are due as follows (and do not include the effects of the $108 million principal amount of 14 1/4% Second Lien Notes due 2011 issued in February and March 2007 or the refinancing of the Canadian loan agreement with Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC (see Note 21 Subsequent Events)): Year Ending December 31, VendorFinancing (1) SeniorSecuredTermLoanFacility (2) OtherLong TermObligations SeniorNotes ConvertibleandExchangeableSenior Notes(3)(4) Step UpSubordinatedDebentures ConvertibleSubordinatedDebentures PurchaseObligations OperatingLeases Total (amounts in thousands) 2007 $ 8,764 $ 12,628 $ 5,600 $ 28,324 $ 5,713 $ 1,832 $ 23,355 $ 815 $ 14,815 $ 101,846 2008 8,944 12,509 28,232 28,324 5,713 2,107 1,354 10,663 97,846 2009 2,414 12,390 28 99,884 5,713 29,679 2,316 7,406 159,830 2010 2,356 12,271 28 19,200 137,879 812 4,676 177,222 2011 4 94,250 28 19,200 261 1,640 115,383 Thereafter 90 283,000 661 1,835 285,586 Total Minimum Principal & Interest Payments 22,482 144,048 34,006 477,932 155,018 33,618 23,355 6,219 41,035 937,713 Less: Amount Representing Interest (2,488 ) (45,798 ) (2,994 ) (171,372 ) (21,446 ) (6,137 ) (653 ) (250,888 ) Face Value of Long Term Obligations 19,994 98,250 31,012 306,560 133,572 27,481 22,702 6,219 41,035 686,825 Less: Amount Representing Discount (1,407 ) (3,947 ) (5,354 ) Add: Exchangeable Notes Interest Treated as Long Term Obligations (3) 9,857 9,857 Book Value of Long Term Obligations $ 19,994 $ 98,250 $ 31,012 $ 306,560 $ 142,022 $ 23,534 $ 22,702 $ 6,219 $ 41,035 $ 691,328 (1) For preparation of this table, we have used the renegotiated payment schedule of Optus promissory note, which extended the payment through December 2008 (see Note 21 Subsequent Events). (2) For preparation of this table, we have assumed the interest rate of the $100 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility to be 11.9%, which is the rate at December 31, 2006. (3) For preparation of this table, we have assumed that the maturity date for the 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes is June 30, 2010 and will not be accelerated to June 30, 2009. (4) For preparation of this table, we have shown separately the cash interest payments of the 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes as a portion of long term obligations (see Note 5 Long Term Obligations). The interest due on the exchangeable notes in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 is $2.8 million, $2.8 million, $2.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively. 57 Table of Contents We have contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from certain carriers with terms greater than one year. We generally do not purchase or commit to purchase quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within the contract term. We have minimum annual purchase obligations of $0.8 million in 2007. The indentures governing the senior notes, convertible senior notes, exchangeable senior notes, step up convertible subordinated debentures, convertible subordinated debentures, and the senior secured term loan facility, as well as other credit arrangements, contain certain financial and other covenants which, among other things, will restrict our ability to incur further indebtedness and make certain payments, including the payment of dividends and repurchase of subordinated debt and certain debt issued by our subsidiaries. The Company was in compliance with the above covenants at December 31, 2006. From time to time, we consider the feasibility and timing of transactions that could raise capital for additional liquidity, debt reduction, refinancing of existing indebtedness and for additional working capital and growth opportunities. There can be no assurance we will be successful in any of these efforts to obtain any such financing on acceptable terms or at all. If we are successful in raising additional financing, securities comprising a significant percentage of our diluted capital may be issued in connection with the completion of such transactions. Additionally, if our plans or assumptions change or prove inaccurate, including those with respect to our debt levels, competitive developments, developments affecting our network or new product initiatives, services, operations or cash from operating activities, if we consummate additional investments or acquisitions, if we experience unexpected costs or competitive pressures or if existing cash and any other borrowings prove to be insufficient, we may need to obtain such financing and or relief sooner than expected. In such circumstances, there can be no assurance we will be successful in these efforts to obtain new capital at acceptable terms. In light of the foregoing, we and or our subsidiaries will evaluate and determine on a continuing basis, depending on market conditions and the outcome of events described herein under Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, the most efficient use of our capital and resources, including investment in our network, systems and new product initiatives, purchasing, refinancing, exchanging, tendering for or retiring certain of our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, open market transactions or by other direct or indirect means or purchasing our common stock in the open market to the extent permitted by our existing covenants. New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No.108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. SAB No.108 requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB No.108 is effective for financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB No.108 for the year ended December 31, 2006 with no impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the over or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an 58 Table of Contents asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. SFAS No. 158 is effective for recognition of the funded status of the benefit plans for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 and is effective for the measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. We anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 does not require new fair value measurements and the Company does not expect the application of this standard to change our current practices. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN No. 48 on its results of operations, financial position and cash flow. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. SFAS No. 155 clarifies certain issues relating to embedded derivatives and beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The provisions of SFAS No. 155 are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, valuations of derivatives and to changes in interest rates. Foreign currency can have a major impact on our financial results. Currently 81% of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the United States. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the USD. The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country. In the future, we expect to continue to derive the majority of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs from outside the United States, and therefore changes in 61 Table of Contents exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates: USD/CAD, USD/AUD, USD/GBP, and USD/EUR. Due to the large percentage of our revenue derived outside of the United States, changes in the USD relative to one or more of the foregoing currencies could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations. We have agreements with certain subsidiaries for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to these subsidiaries. As we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future, we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. We historically have not engaged in hedging transactions. However, the exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies. We are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries. We translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into USD using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year. By way of example, when the USD strengthens compared to the EUR, there could be a negative or positive effect on the reported results for Europe, depending upon whether Europe is operating profitably or at a loss. It takes more profits in EUR to generate the same amount of profits in USD and a greater loss in EUR to generate the same amount of loss in USD. The opposite is also true. For instance, when the USD weakens there is a positive effect on reported profits and a negative effect on reported losses for Europe. In the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, the USD was weaker on average as compared to the CAD, EUR and GBP, and stronger on average as compared to the AUD. As a result, our revenue of the subsidiaries whose local currency is AUD, CAD, GBP and EUR increased (decreased) (10)%, (1)%, (26)% and (39)% in local currency compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, but increased (decreased) (11)%, 5%, (26)% and (38)% in USD, respectively. Interest rates The majority of our long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates at December 31, 2006. In February 2005, we obtained a $100 million senior secured loan facility, which has a variable interest rate feature. We are exposed to interest rate risk as additional financing may be required. Our primary exposure to market risk stems from fluctuations in interest rates. We do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments. The interest rate sensitivity table below summarizes our market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates for the year ended 2006 in USD, which is our reporting currency. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our senior notes, convertible senior notes, exchangeable senior notes, convertible subordinated debentures, leased fiber capacity, and other long term obligations in effect at December 31, 2006. In the case of the convertible senior notes and convertible subordinated debentures the table excludes the potential exercise of the relevant redemption and conversion features and excludes an unamortized debt discount of $5.4 million and future cash interest payments of $9.9 million from our 5% Exchangeable Senior Notes that are treated as long term obligations (see Note 5 Long Term Obligations). The table reflects a new schedule for Optus principal payments based on a renegotiated agreement in February 2007 but excludes the March 2007 issuance of the new 14 1/4% Second Lien Notes (see Note 21 Subsequent Events).
