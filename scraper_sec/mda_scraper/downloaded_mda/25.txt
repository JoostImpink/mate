Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Overview Thomas & Betts Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of essential components used to manage the connection, distribution, transmission and reliability of electrical power in industrial, construction and utility applications. We are also a leading producer of commercial heating and ventilation units used in commercial and industrial buildings and highly engineered steel structures used for utility transmission. We have operations in over 20 countries. Manufacturing, marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in North America and Europe. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales, costs, expenses, assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. We recognize revenue for service agreements over the applicable service periods. Sales discounts, quantity and price rebates, and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized. Quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans, which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers. Certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling our products into targeted construction projects or markets. Following a distributors sale of an eligible product, the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate. A number of distributors, primarily in our Electrical segment, have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns, which are reasonably estimable, are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment. We analyze historical returns and allowances, current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals. We provide allowances for doubtful accounts when credit losses are both probable and estimable. Inventory Valuation: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. To ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories. We also periodically perform an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items. Such evaluations are based on managements judgment and use of estimates. Such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand, aging of the inventory, sales history and forecasts for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: We apply the acquisition (purchase) method of accounting for all business combinations. Under this method, all assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, including goodwill, indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles, are recorded at fair value. The purchase price allocation requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill Page 21 of 96 Table of Contents consists principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized. For each amortizable intangible asset, we use a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, the straight line amortization method is used. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent interim assessments. In evaluating when an interim assessment of goodwill is necessary, we consider, among other things, the trading level of our common stock, our market capitalization, changes in expected future cash flows and mergers and acquisitions involving companies in our industry. In evaluating when an interim assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary, we review for significant events or significant changes in circumstances. In conjunction with each test of goodwill we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting units carrying amount. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of three valuation methods: market multiple approach; discounted cash flow approach; and comparable transactions approach. The market multiple approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business. The discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates. The comparable transactions approach provides indications of value based on an examination of recent transactions in which companies in similar lines of business were acquired. The fair values derived from these three valuation methods are then weighted to arrive at a single value for each reporting unit. Relative weights assigned to the three methods are based upon the availability, relevance and reliability of the underlying data. We then reconcile the total values for all reporting units to our market capitalization and evaluate the reasonableness of the implied control premium. To the extent a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired, and we must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment. The second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as of the assessment date. The implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date. Methods used to determine fair values for indefinite lived intangible assets involve customary valuation techniques that are applicable to the particular class of intangible asset and apply inputs and assumptions that we believe a market participant would use. Long Lived Assets: We review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Indications of impairment require significant judgment by management. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets, we evaluate assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are considered to be impaired. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. When fair values are not available, we Page 22 of 96 Table of Contents estimate fair values using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions: We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs, we use certain actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and or liability measurement. We evaluate these assumptions annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors (retirement patterns, mortality and turnover), rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate. See additional information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Qualified Pension Plans. Income Taxes: We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and requires an evaluation of the realizability of deferred income tax assets based on a more likely than not criteria. We have valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign income tax credit carryforwards. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. We believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income, based on enacted tax laws in effect as of December 31, 2011, will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances. Environmental Costs: Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of currently available facts related to each site. The operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas, and requires subjective judgements by management in assessing environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities.

(CMG) (October 2010) in our Electrical segment, the positive impact of current year price increases, which were primarily to offset commodity cost increases, and a weaker U.S. dollar. Earnings from operations in 2011 increased from 2010, both in dollars and as a percent of sales. This improvement reflects the impact of a favorable shift in product mix in our Electrical segment, improved manufacturing leverage from increased production volumes, especially in our Electrical segment, and the impact of acquisitions. Earnings from operations in 2011 included a benefit from legal settlements, in addition to charges related to facility consolidations in our Electrical and HVAC segments. Earnings from operations in 2010 included charges related to facility consolidations in our Electrical and HVAC segments and a charge for environmental remediation. Page 24 of 96 Table of Contents Net earnings in 2011 were $190.2 million ($3.60 per diluted share) compared to net earnings of $145.6 million ($2.76 per diluted share) in 2010. Net earnings in 2011 included net after tax facility consolidation charges of $4.3 million ($0.08 per diluted share), a net after tax benefit from legal settlements of $3.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share) and the favorable impact of a $4.0 million ($0.08 per diluted share) reduction in the annual effective tax rate resulting from routine income tax estimate refinements for 2010 tax returns. Net earnings in 2010 included net after tax facility consolidation charges of $5.8 million ($0.11 per diluted share), a net after tax environmental remediation charge of $3.3 million ($0.06 per diluted share) and a $1.5 million ($0.03 per diluted share) benefit related to the release of a tax reserve. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales in 2011 were $2.3 billion, up 14.6% from 2010. Higher sales volumes in each of our segments, especially the Electrical segment, positively impacted year over year sales. The sales increase from the prior year attributable to the 2011 acquisition and the annualization of 2010 acquisitions was approximately $79 million. Price had a positive impact on year over year consolidated sales, primarily in Electrical and Steel Structures segments. A weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately $40 million in 2011 when compared to 2010. Gross profit in 2011 was $718.5 million, or 31.3% of net sales, compared to $617.0 million, or 30.8% of net sales, in 2010. The year over year increase in gross profit, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales, reflects higher organic sales volumes, improved product mix, the positive impact from acquisitions, actions taken to manage costs and improved manufacturing leverage from increased production volumes. Gross profit in 2011 includes pre tax charges of $5.1 million for facility consolidations compared to $9.1 million of pre tax facility consolidation charges in 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2011 was $428.7 million, or 18.7% of net sales, compared to $396.3 million, or 19.8% of net sales, in the prior year. SG&A as a percent of sales in both periods reflects the leverage impact of incremental volumes on our fixed cost base and our continued overall efforts to tightly manage expenses. SG&A expense in 2011 includes a pre tax benefit of $4.8 million from legal settlements and pre tax charges of $1.2 million for facility consolidations. SG&A expenses in 2010 were impacted by pre tax environmental remediation charges of $5.3 million. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $32.0 million in 2011, down 8.9% from 2010. The decrease reflects the impact of lower average debt levels in 2011 in addition to increased interest income associated with higher cash balances in the current year. Interest income included in interest expense, net was $2.9 million in 2011 and $2.5 million in 2010. Interest expense was $34.9 million for 2011 and $37.6 million for 2010. Income Taxes The effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2011 was 26.4% compared to 25.7% in 2010. The effective rate for 2011 reflects the favorable impact of a $4.0 million benefit resulting from routine Page 25 of 96 Table of Contents income tax estimate refinements for 2010 tax returns. The effective rate for 2010 reflects the favorable impact of a $1.5 million benefit related to the release of a tax reserve. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for both years also reflects benefits from our Puerto Rican manufacturing operations. Net Earnings Net earnings in 2011 were $190.2 million, or $3.60 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $145.6 million, or $2.76 per diluted share, in 2010. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2011 include a net after tax benefit totaling $2.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) associated with facility consolidations ($0.08 per diluted share), a benefit from legal settlements ($0.05 per diluted share) and a benefit from the reduction in the annual effective tax rate resulting from routine income tax estimate refinements for 2010 tax returns ($0.08 per diluted share). Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 include a net after tax charge totaling $7.6 million ($0.14 per diluted share) associated with facility consolidations ($0.11 per diluted share), an environmental remediation charge ($0.06 per diluted share) and a benefit related to the release of a tax reserve ($0.03 per diluted share). Earnings from discontinued operations, net in 2010 were $7.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Earnings from discontinued operations, net in 2010 included a $3.3 million gain on sale in conjunction with the divesture of the non strategic communications products business. Year 2010 Compared with 2009 Overview Net sales in 2010 increased from 2009 primarily reflecting the positive impacts of the 2010 acquisitions in the Electrical segment and higher sales volumes in the Electrical segment, which were partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our Steel Structures and HVAC segments. Earnings from operations in 2010 increased from 2009, both in dollars and as a percent of sales. This improvement reflects the 2010 acquisitions, higher sales and production volumes, previous actions to manage costs, headcount and capacity, as well as the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Earnings from operations in 2010 included charges related to facility consolidations in our Electrical and HVAC segments and a charge for environmental remediation. Earnings from operations in 2009 included a charge related to a facility consolidation in our Electrical segment, a charge for intangible asset impairment, a charge for environmental remediation and a charge related to a debt refinancing. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 were $137.7 million ($2.61 per diluted share) compared to net earnings of $100.9 million ($1.91 per diluted share) in 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 include a net after tax charge totaling $7.6 million ($0.14 per diluted share), as described below. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2009 included a net after tax charge totaling $12.4 million ($0.23 per diluted share), as described below. Net Sales and Gross Profit Net sales in 2010 were $2.0 billion, up 9.4% from 2009. The sales increase from the prior year attributable to 2010 acquisitions was 5.4% or $98.7 million. Higher volumes in our Electrical segment also positively impacted year over year sales. A weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately $35 million in 2010 when compared to 2009. Gross profit in 2010 was $617.0 million, or 30.8% of net sales, compared to $553.2 million, or 30.2% of net sales, in 2009. The year over year increase in gross profit reflects the positive impact Page 26 of 96 Table of Contents from the 2010 acquisitions, higher sales and production volumes, continued pricing discipline, improved product mix and previous actions taken to manage costs, headcount and capacity. Gross profit in 2010 includes pre tax charges of $9.1 million for facility consolidations compared to $3.6 million of pre tax facility consolidation charges in 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in 2010 was $396.3 million, or 19.8% of net sales, compared to $367.0 million, or 20.0% of net sales, in the prior year. SG&A expenses in 2010 were impacted by pre tax environmental remediation charges of $5.3 million in 2010 and $4 million in 2009. SG&A as a percent of sales in both periods reflects our continued overall efforts to tightly manage expenses and the leverage impact of incremental volumes on our fixed cost base. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net was $35.1 million in 2010, down modestly from 2009. The decrease reflects the impact of increased interest income from higher average cash balances in 2010. Interest income included in interest expense, net was $2.5 million in 2010 and $0.8 million in 2009. Interest expense was $37.6 million for 2010 and $36.3 million for 2009. Income Taxes The effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2010 was 25.7% compared to 28.1% in 2009. The decreased effective rate for 2010 reflects the favorable impact related to the release of a $1.5 million tax reserve assumed with a 2007 acquisition. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for both years also reflects benefits from our Puerto Rican manufacturing operations. Net Earnings Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 were $137.7 million, or $2.61 per diluted share, compared to net earnings from continuing operations of $100.9 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, in 2009. Net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 include a net after tax charge totaling $7.6 million ($0.14 per diluted share) associated with facility consolidations ($0.11 per diluted share), an environmental remediation charge ($0.06 per diluted share) and a benefit related to the release of a tax reserve ($0.03 per diluted share). Net earnings from continuing operations in 2009 included a net after tax charge totaling $12.4 million ($0.23 per diluted share) associated with debt refinancing ($0.08 per diluted share), a facility consolidation ($0.04 per diluted share), a non cash charge for intangible asset impairment ($0.07 per diluted share), and an environmental remediation charge ($0.04 per diluted share). Earnings from discontinued operations, net was $7.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in 2010 compared to $7.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in 2009. Earnings from discontinued operations, net in 2010 included a $3.3 million gain on sale in conjunction with the divesture of the non strategic communications products business. Net earnings in 2010 were $145.6 million, or $2.76 per diluted share. Net earnings in 2009 were $107.9 million, or $2.04 per diluted share.

We evaluate our business segments primarily on the basis of segment earnings, with segment earnings defined as earnings before corporate expense, depreciation and amortization expense, share based compensation expense, interest, income taxes and certain other items. Our segment earnings are significantly influenced by the operating performance of our Electrical segment that accounted 80% or more of our consolidated net sales and consolidated segment earnings during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Electrical Segment Year 2011 Compared with 2010 Electrical segment net sales in 2011 were $1.9 billion, up $226.6 million, or 13.5%, from 2010. The year over year sales growth was primarily attributable to increased volumes, especially for our industrial and utility distribution products. The sales increase from the prior year attributable to the annualization of the 2010 acquisitions was approximately $54 million. The weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $39 million in 2011. Price increases, primarily to offset rising raw material costs, positively impacted net sales when compared to the prior year. Page 28 of 96 Table of Contents Electrical segment earnings in 2011 were $382.2 million, up 20.9% from 2010. Segment earnings reflect pre tax facility consolidation charges of $4.8 million in 2011 (first and second quarter) and $7.4 million in 2010 (first and fourth quarter). The increase in 2011 segment earnings compared to 2010 reflects the contribution from the annualization of the 2010 acquisitions, improved product mix, manufacturing leverage from increased volume, and the benefits of current and prior year right sizing actions. Year 2010 Compared with 2009 Electrical segment net sales in 2010 were $1.7 billion, up $190.3 million, or 12.8%, from 2009. The sales increase from the prior year attributable to the 2010 acquisitions of JT Packard & Associates, Inc. (JT Packard), PMA AG (PMA) and Cable Management Group, Ltd. (CMG) was 6.6% or approximately $98.7 million. Increased volumes also positively impacted year over year sales and reflect improved industrial and utility distribution demand. The weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $37 million in 2010. Electrical segment earnings in 2010 were $316.2 million, up 22.8% from 2009. Segment earnings reflect pre tax facility consolidation charges of $7.4 million in 2010 and $3.6 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 segment earnings compared to 2009 reflects the contribution from the 2010 acquisitions, increased sales and production volumes, productivity improvements, improved product mix, and previous actions taken to manage costs, headcount and capacity. Steel Structures Segment Year 2011 Compared with 2010 Net sales in 2011 in our Steel Structures segment were $250.8 million, up $30.9 million, or 14.0%, from 2010. The net sales increase in 2011 primarily reflects increased production volumes, the positive price impact from the pass through of higher year over year plate steel costs and an improved pricing environment during the second half of 2011. Segment earnings in 2011 were $30.7 million, down 12.2% from 2010, reflecting the declines in project margins due to project mix and a more competitive pricing environment. Year 2010 Compared with 2009 Net sales in 2010 in our Steel Structures segment were $219.9 million, down $14.6 million, or 6.2%, from 2009. The benefit from higher year over year production levels was more than fully offset by the revenue impact of lower year over year steel prices and more competitive market conditions. The current competitive pricing environment is also expected to persist in 2011. Segment earnings in 2010 were $34.9 million, down 26.3% from 2009, compared to the unusually strong earnings performance in 2009 as well as the difficult pricing conditions experienced during 2010. HVAC Segment Year 2011 Compared with 2010 Net sales in 2011 in our HVAC segment were $141.5 million, up $35.7 million, or 33.7%, from 2010. The 2011 sales increase attributable to the July 2011 acquisition of AmbiRad was approximately $25 million. Additionally, increased volumes positively impacted year over year sales. HVAC segment earnings in 2011 were $20.9 million, up 29.4%, from 2010. Lower year over year segment earnings as a percent of sales reflect acquisition accounting adjustments related to the AmbiRad acquisition partially offset by improved manufacturing leverage from increased volume. Segment earnings reflect pre tax facility consolidation charges of $1.5 million in 2011 (first and second quarter) and $1.7 million in 2010 (fourth quarter). Page 29 of 96 Table of Contents Year 2010 Compared with 2009 Net sales in 2010 in our HVAC segment were $105.8 million, $4.1 million, or down 3.7%, from 2009. HVAC segment earnings in 2010 were $16.1 million, down 11.4% from 2009. The sales and earnings declines reflect lower sales volumes resulting from weak commercial construction markets. Segment earnings in 2010 include a pre tax $1.7 million facility consolidation charge. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $552 million and $455 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following table reflects the primary category totals in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (In thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 194,308 $ 275,712 $ 237,862 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (72,570 ) (128,121 ) (35,091 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (15,255 ) (179,666 ) (53,110 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (9,425 ) 8,660 36,458 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 97,058 (23,415 ) 186,119 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 455,198 478,613 292,494 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 552,256 $ 455,198 $ 478,613 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 included net earnings of $190 million. Operating activities in 2011 included depreciation and amortization of $84 million and share based compensation expense of $16 million. Net changes in working capital (accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) and accrued liabilities negatively impacted cash flows in 2011. Operating activities in 2011 also reflects $43 million of funding to qualified pension plans (including voluntary contributions of $39 million). Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily attributable to net earnings of $146 million. Operating activities in 2010 included depreciation and amortization of $81 million, share based compensation expense of $15 million and a gain on the sale of a divested business of $3 million. Net changes in working capital (accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) and accrued liabilities positively impacted cash flows in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was primarily attributable to net earnings of $108 million. Operating activities in 2009 included depreciation and amortization of $75 million, share based compensation expense of $16 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $6 million and a non cash charge for intangible asset impairment of $6 million. Net changes in working capital (accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) and accrued liabilities positively impacted cash flows in 2009. Funding to qualified pension plans of $52 million negatively impacted cash flows in 2009 (including voluntary contributions of $50 million). Investing Activities Investing activities in 2011 included cash paid of approximately $30 million to acquire AmbiRad during July 2011. During 2011, we had capital expenditures to support our ongoing business plans totaling approximately $45 million. Page 30 of 96 Table of Contents Investing activities in 2010 included cash paid of approximately $78 million ($114 million purchase price less debt assumed and subsequently retired of $36 million) to acquire PMA, approximately $76 million ($110 million purchase price less debt assumed and subsequently retired of $34 million) to acquire CMG and approximately $21 million to acquire JT Packard. Investing activities in 2010 also reflected the sale of our non strategic communications products business for proceeds of $78 million. During 2010, we had capital expenditures to support our ongoing business plans totaling $33 million. During 2009, we had capital expenditures to support our ongoing business plans totaling $41 million. Financing Activities Financing activities in 2011 included the repurchase of 1.0 million common shares for $46 million and $27 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Financing activities in 2011 resulted in no net change in the balance of our revolving credit facilities from year end 2010 to year end 2011. Financing activities in 2010 included the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million common shares for $66 million, the repayment of approximately $36 million to retire debt assumed as part of the PMA acquisition and approximately $34 million to retire debt assumed as part of the CMG acquisitions, and $20 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Additionally, during 2010 we paid down $65 million of outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility. Financing activities in 2009 included the repurchase of 1.0 million common shares for $25 million. During 2009, we issued $250 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2021 and used a portion of the net proceeds to retire $125 million of 7.25% notes due 2013 and repay $95 million of outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility. During 2009, we repaid $148 million of debt using a combination of cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Financing activities in 2009 resulted in no net change in the balance of our revolving credit facility from year end 2008 to year end 2009. During 2009, we reduced our total outstanding debt by approximately $26 million. Credit Facilities During the third quarter of 2011, we entered into a new $500 million unsecured, senior credit facility (new revolving credit facility) with a five year term expiring in August 2016. At December 31, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Under the new revolving credit facility agreement, we will select an interest rate at the time of its initial draw reflecting LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating or the highest rate based on several other benchmark rates, including: (i) JPMorgan Chase Banks New York prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate, or (iii) an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin based on our credit rating. All borrowings and other extensions of credit under our new revolving credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties. The proceeds of any loans under the facility may be used for general operating needs and for other general corporate purposes in compliance with the terms of the facility agreement. We pay an annual commitment fee to maintain the facility of 20 basis points based upon our current credit rating. Fees to access the facility and letters of credit are based on a pricing grid related to our debt ratings with Moodys, S&P and Fitch during the term of the facility. Page 31 of 96 Table of Contents The Corporations new revolving credit facility requires that it maintain: a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00; and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. The new revolving credit facility also contains customary covenants that could restrict our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; grant liens; make investments, loans, or guarantees; declare dividends; or repurchase company stock. Outstanding letters of credit, which reduced availability under the new revolving credit facility, amounted to $17.7 million at December 31, 2011. The letters of credit relate primarily to third party insurance claims processing. Concurrent to entering into the new revolving credit facility, we amended our existing unsecured, senior credit facility (existing revolving credit facility) to reduce the total availability under this facility from $750 million to the $325 million of debt outstanding plus open letters of credit outstanding under the facility at the time of the amendment. Letters of credit under this facility at December 31, 2011 amounted to $2.4 million. The letters of credit relate primarily to environmental assurances. As borrowings and letters of credit under the facility are reduced, the amount of the facility will decrease. The amendment to the existing revolving credit facility conformed all covenants and obligations to those found in the new revolving credit facility, except those related to interest on borrowings and fees, which remain unchanged. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $325 million was outstanding under this facility. The existing revolving credit facility has a five year term expiring October 2012. Other Credit Facilities We have a EUR 10 million (approximately US$13.1 million) committed revolving credit facility with a European bank. We pay an annual commitment fee of 20 basis points on the undrawn balance to maintain this facility. This credit facility contains standard covenants and events of default such as covenant default and cross default. This facility has an indefinite maturity and no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Outstanding letters of credit which reduced availability under the European facility amounted to EUR 1.0 million (approximately US$1.4 million) at December 31, 2011. We have a CAN 10 million (approximately US$9.8 million) committed revolving credit facility with a Canadian bank. We pay an annual commitment fee of 20 basis points on the undrawn balance to maintain this facility. This credit facility contains standard covenants and events of default such as covenant default and cross default. This facility matures in 2016, and no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Other Letters of Credit As of December 31, 2011, we also had letters of credit in addition to those discussed above that do not reduce availability under the Corporations credit facilities. We had $2.8 million of such additional letters of credit that relate primarily to third party insurance claims processing, performance guarantees, performance bonds and acquisition obligations. Page 32 of 96 Table of Contents Compliance and Availability We are in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our credit facilities. However, if we fail to be in compliance with the financial or other covenants of our credit agreements, then the credit agreements could be terminated, any outstanding borrowings under the agreements could be accelerated and immediately due, and we could have difficulty replacing those credit facilities or obtaining credit facilities in the future. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate availability of funds under our credit facilities is approximately $504 million, after deducting outstanding letters of credit. Availability is subject to the satisfaction of various covenants and conditions to borrowing. Credit Ratings As of December 31, 2011, we had investment grade credit ratings from Standard & Poors (BBB rating), Moodys Investor Service (Baa2 rating) and Fitch Ratings (BBB rating) on our senior unsecured debt. Should these credit ratings drop, repayment under our credit facilities and securities will not be accelerated; however, our credit costs may increase. Similarly, if our credit ratings improve, we could potentially have a decrease in our credit costs. The maturity of any of our debt securities does not accelerate in the event of a credit downgrade. Debt Securities We had the following unsecured debt securities outstanding as of December 31, 2011: Issue Date Amount Interest Rate Interest Payable Maturity Date November 2009 $250.0 million 5.625% May 15 and November 15 November 2021 Other In September 2010, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan that authorized the Corporation to buy up to 3,000,000 of its common shares. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased, with available cash resources, 1,500,000 (1,000,000 in 2011; 500,000 in 2010) common shares, through open market transactions. As of December 31, 2011, 1,500,000 shares remain available under this authorization. The timing of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions. This authorization expires in December 2012. We do not currently pay cash dividends. Future decisions concerning the payment of cash dividends on the common stock will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, strategic investment opportunities, continued compliance with credit facilities and other factors that the Board of Directors may consider relevant. As of December 31, 2011, we have approximately $552 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $504 million of aggregate availability under our credit facilities. We renewed our shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2011, utilizing the well known seasoned issuer (WKSI) process. The registration statement permits us to issue an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. The registration statement is effective for a period of three years from the date of filing. We continue to have cash requirements to, among other things, support working capital and capital expenditure needs, service debt and fund our retirement plans as required. We generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing credit facilities or access the Page 33 of 96 Table of Contents capital markets as needed for liquidity. We believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy both short term and long term requirements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Refer to Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our guarantee and indemnification arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2011: (In millions) Total 2012 2013through2014 2015through2016 Thereafter Long Term Debt Including Current Maturities(a) $ 574.8 $ 325.3 $ 0.9 $ $ 248.6 (b) Estimated Interest Payments(c) 164.1 23.6 36.8 35.1 68.6 Operating Lease Obligations 58.2 16.7 22.8 11.9 6.8 Total Contractual Cash Obligations(d) $ 797.1 $ 365.6 $ 60.5 $ 47.0 $ 324.0 (a) Includes capital leases. (b) Principal amount excluding unamortized discount is $250 million. (c) Reflects stated interest rates for fixed rate debt (including debt hedged via an interest rate swap) and year end interest rates for variable rate debt. (d) We have liabilities associated with our qualified and non qualified pension and postretirement benefit plans reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. Future contribution obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Funding of these obligations will be dependent on future events such as the funded status of benefit plans, laws and regulations and the employment decisions of participants. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be precisely determined. We expect required contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2012 to be minimal. Credit Risk We continually evaluate the credit risk associated with our customers. Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated in part by the large number of customers comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic areas. No customer receivable exceeds 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011. See also Risk Factors. Qualified Pension Plans We have domestic and foreign qualified pension plans with domestic plans accounting for a substantial portion of total plan liabilities and assets. Our contributions to all qualified pension plans were $43 million (including $39 million of voluntary contributions) in 2011, $2 million in 2010 and $52 million (including $50 million of voluntary contributions) in 2009. We expect required Page 34 of 96 Table of Contents contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2012 to be minimal. The following information indicates the funded status for our qualified pension plans: All qualified pension plans: (In millions) December 31,2011 December 31,2010 Benefit obligation $ 591 $ 535 Fair value of plan assets $ 465 $ 456 Our qualified pension plan assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, were included in the following asset categories: Plan Assets December 31, 2011 2010 Asset Category Domestic equity securities 38 % 40 % International equity securities 20 % 21 % Debt securities 28 % 26 % Other, including alternative investments 14 % 13 % Total 100 % 100 % The financial objectives of our investment policy is (1) to maximize returns in order to minimize contributions and long term cost of funding pension liabilities, within reasonable and prudent levels of risk, (2) to match liability growth with the objective of fully funding benefits as they accrue and (3) to achieve annualized returns in excess of the policy benchmark. Our asset allocation targets are 43% U.S. domestic equity securities, 15% international equity securities, 26% fixed income and high yield debt securities and 16% other, including alternative investments. The long term rates of return we use for our qualified pension plans take into account expected forward looking rates for the plans asset classes and the plans historical investment experience over a multi year period, as well as mix of plan asset investment types, market conditions, investment practices of our Retirement Plans Committee and advice from investment professionals and actuarial advisors. The weighted average long term rates of return used to determine net periodic pension cost for all qualified pension plans are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Weighted average long term rates of return used to determine net periodic pension cost 7.7 % 8.0 % 8.6 % Reflected in the rates above are domestic weighted average long term rates of return of 8.0% for 2011, 8.3% for 2010 and 8.8% for 2009. The assumed discount rates we use for our qualified pension plans represent long term high quality corporate bond rates commensurate with liability durations of our plans. Discount rates used to determine net periodic pension cost for all qualified pension plans are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Discount rates used to determine net periodic pension cost 5.2 % 5.7 % 6.4 % Page 35 of 96 Table of Contents Reflected in the rates above are domestic discount rates to determine net periodic pension cost of 5.3% in 2011, 5.8% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2009. Discount rates used to determine pension benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for all qualified pension plans were 4.3%, 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively, and reflect domestic discount rates of 4.3% for 2011, 5.3% for 2010 and 5.8% for 2009. The potential impact on the 2011 net periodic pension cost resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point change in the assumed weighted average long term rate of return while maintaining a constant discount rate would be approximately $4 million. The potential impact on the 2011 net periodic pension cost resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate while maintaining a constant weighted average long term rate of return would be a decrease of approximately $2 million, and a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate while maintaining a constant weighted average long term rate of return would be an increase of approximately $1 million. Effective January 1, 2011, pension plan benefit accruals have been suspended for the domestic non bargaining plan participants under the Thomas & Betts Pension Plan. We will provide as a replacement benefit certain non elective contributions, including certain transition benefits, under its existing domestic defined contribution plan. Additionally during 2011, the Corporation and the Union representing collectively bargained employees at one of the locations covered by the Thomas & Betts Corporation Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees approved a plan to discontinue the future accrual of future benefits after December 31, 2011. We will provide as a replacement benefit certain non elective contributions, including certain transition benefits, under its existing domestic defined contribution plan. For additional information regarding our qualified and non qualified pension plans and other post retirement plans, refer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In 2010, we divested our non strategic communications products business for cash consideration of $78 million. The revenues and financial performance of the communications products business have been removed from the presentation of continuing operations and presented as a single line item in Discontinued Operations. This business was previously included in the Electrical segment, contributing $52.7 million of net sales and $7.9 million of net earnings in 2010, including a $3.3 million gain on divestiture. During 2009, this business contributed $66.0 million of net sales and net earnings of $7.0 million. Page 36 of 96 Table of Contents Subsequent Event On January 29, 2012, Thomas & Betts Corporation, Swiss based ABB Ltd and a wholly owned subsidiary of ABB entered into a merger agreement. At the closing of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement, (i) the Corporation will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ABB, and (ii) each common share of the Corporation will be converted into the right to receive $72.00 in cash (approximately $3.9 billion total purchase consideration), without interest. The closing of the merger is subject to customary conditions, including approval of the shareholders of the Corporations common stock and expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act and the antitrust laws of certain foreign jurisdictions. Among other things, the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for the Corporation and ABB, and further provides that, upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, the Corporation will be obligated to pay a termination fee to ABB of $116 million. There is no assurance that the merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. See Risk Factors. Page 37 of 96 Table of Contents Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk and Financial Instruments Thomas & Betts is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and raw material prices. At times, we may enter into various derivative instruments to manage certain of these risks. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk The Corporation has a forward starting amortizing interest rate swap for a notional amount of $200 million. The interest rate swap agreement expires on October 1, 2012. The interest rate swap hedges the Corporations exposure to changes in interest rates on $200 million of borrowings under its existing credit facility. The Corporation has designated the receive variable/pay fixed interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. Under the interest rate swap, the Corporation receives one month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and pays an underlying fixed rate of 4.86%. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a swap liability of $7.2 million and a related contra equity amount, net of tax, of $4.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. Interest expense, net reflects a negligible benefit in 2011, 2010 and 2009 for the ineffective portion of the swap. The following table reflects our interest rate sensitive derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2011: Expected Maturities DuringYear Ended December 31, December 31,2011Fair Value(Liability) (In millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Maturities on floating to fixed interest rate swap $200 $ (7.2 ) Average pay rate 4.86% Average receive rate 1 month LIBOR Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts The Corporation had no outstanding forward sale or purchase contracts as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. The Corporation is exposed to the effects of changes in exchange rates primarily from the Canadian dollar and European currencies. From time to time, the Corporation utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to mitigate this risk. Commodities Futures Contracts The Corporation had no outstanding commodities futures contracts as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. The Corporation is exposed to risk from fluctuating prices for certain materials used to manufacture its products, such as: steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, resins and rubber compounds. At times, some of the risk associated with usage of aluminum, copper and zinc has been mitigated through the use of futures contracts that mitigate the price exposure to these commodities.
