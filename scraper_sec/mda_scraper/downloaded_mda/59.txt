ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We operate in the following two business segments, which are managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations: program management services and hospitals. Program management services include hospital rehabilitation services (including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs) and skilled nursing rehabilitation services (including contract therapy in skilled nursing facilities, resident centered management consulting services and staffing services for therapists and nurses). Our hospitals segment owns and operates 29 long term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) and 5 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) Revenues: Program management: Skilled nursing rehabilitation services $ 516,278 $ 496,250 $ 457,229 Hospital rehabilitation services 180,009 178,168 165,658 Program management total 696,287 674,418 622,887 Hospitals 633,156 174,194 91,143 Total $ 1,329,443 $ 848,612 $ 714,030 Operating Earnings (Loss): Program management: Skilled nursing rehabilitation services $ 39,184 $ 37,753 $ 25,544 Hospital rehabilitation services 32,925 29,487 21,997 Program management total 72,109 67,240 47,541 Hospitals (1) 61,450 (26,066 ) (18,511 ) Unallocated corporate expenses (2) (254 ) (731 ) Total $ 133,559 $ 40,920 $ 28,299 (1) The 2009 operating earnings of hospitals include $7.2 million of acquisition related expenses for costs directly related to the acquisition of Triumph including fees for legal, accounting, advisory and other outside services. (2) Represents general corporate overhead costs associated with Phase 2 Consulting, Inc., which was sold on June 1, 2009. Effective November 24, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Triumph HealthCare Holdings, Inc. (Triumph) for a purchase price of approximately $541.0 million. On the acquisition date, Triumph operated 20 LTACHs in seven states. Triumphs results of operations have been included in our financial statements prospectively beginning after the date of acquisition. In 2009, we also acquired LTACHs in Dallas, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and opened a majority owned LTACH in Peoria, Illinois. In 2010, we opened an LTACH in Houston, Texas. These activities expanded the number of LTACHs we own and operate to 29, making us the third largest LTACH provider in the United States. 33 In November 2010, we announced that we had entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement with Select Medical Corporation under which we agreed to exchange our 60 bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Miami (the Miami hospital) for Selects 70 bed long term acute care hospital in northwest Indiana. This transaction closed on January 1, 2011. The Miami hospital has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Prior year comparative amounts throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been adjusted to reflect the treatment of the Miami hospital as a discontinued operation. Effective June 1, 2009, we completed the sale of all the outstanding common stock of Phase 2 Consulting, Inc. (Phase 2) to Premier, Inc. for approximately $5.5 million. Phase 2 provides management and economic consulting services to the healthcare industry and had been a subsidiary of ours since it was acquired in 2004. This transaction allows our management to focus on its core businesses. Phase 2 has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to GAAP. Sources of Revenue In our program management segment, we derive the majority of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors. A portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies. Our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms. Our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities. In our hospital segment, we derive nearly all of our revenues from fees for patient care services, which are usually paid for or reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or third party managed care programs. Our hospital segment accounted for 47.6% of our consolidated operating revenues in 2010. The following table identifies the primary payer sources and relative mix of our hospital segments net operating revenues for the periods stated: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Medicare 69.5 % 69.1 % 75.9 % Medicaid 1.2 2.1 0.7 Other third party payors 28.8 27.9 22.3 Self pay 0.1 0.1 0.5 Total net patient revenue 99.6 99.2 99.4 Other revenue 0.4 0.8 0.6 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Triumphs results of operations have been included in our hospital segments results prospectively beginning after the November 2009 date of acquisition. The decrease in the percent of net revenues attributable to Medicare from 2008 to 2010 reflects an increase in revenues attributable to managed Medicare and private fee for service plans that are included in other third party payors category in the table above. As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress created a program of private, managed healthcare coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. This program has been referred to as Medicare Part C, Medicare+Choice or Medicare Advantage. While we expect our payor mix will remain heavily weighted towards traditional Medicare, we could continue to see a shift of traditional Medicare patients into managed Medicare and private fee for service plans. 34 Results of Operations The following table sets forth the percentage that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Operating revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost and expenses: Operating 79.5 80.7 81.1 Selling, general and administrative 8.2 12.6 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 2.3 1.9 2.0 Operating earnings 10.0 4.8 4.0 Interest expense (2.5 ) (0.7 ) (0.6 ) Equity in net income of affiliate 0.1 0.1 0.1 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 7.6 4.2 3.5 Income taxes 2.7 1.9 1.4 Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax 4.9 2.3 2.1 Gain from discontinued operations, net of tax 0.1 0.2 0.2 Net earnings 5.0 2.5 2.3 Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) 0.2 0.3 Net earnings attributable to RehabCare 4.7 % 2.7 % 2.6 % Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 Revenues 2010 2009 % Change (dollars in thousands) Skilled nursing rehabilitation services $ 516,278 $ 496,250 4.0 % Hospital rehabilitation services 180,009 178,168 1.0 Hospitals 633,156 174,194 263.5 Consolidated revenues $ 1,329,443 $ 848,612 56.7 % Consolidated operating revenues increased from $848.6 million in 2009 to over $1.3 billion in 2010. The revenue increase primarily reflects the continued growth of our hospital and skilled nursing rehabilitation services. The 2010 growth in our hospital business is primarily due to the acquisition of Triumph on November 24, 2009 but also reflects same store revenue growth. Revenues for hospital rehabilitation services increased slightly in 2010. Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services (SRS). SRS operating revenues increased $20.0 million or 4.0% from 2009 to 2010. The average number of contract therapy locations operated in 2010 grew 4.3% compared to 2009. Same store contract therapy revenues increased by 2.2% while minutes of service decreased by 0.1% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Same store revenues grew by 8.8% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The reduction in our same store revenue growth rate primarily reflects both pricing pressure resulting from a market basket decrease for skilled nursing facilities as per CMSs final rule for rate year 2010, which was effective beginning on October 1, 2009, and a reduction in Medicare Part B therapy minutes delivered resulting from the elimination of the Part B therapy cap exception process during the months of January and February 2010. We also believe the higher same store revenue growth rate in the prior year reflected the continued development and implementation of clinical programs designed to achieve optimal outcomes, and there is currently less of an opportunity for incremental growth from such programs. 35 Hospital Rehabilitation Services (HRS). HRS operating revenues increased $1.8 million or 1.0% from 2009 to 2010 as inpatient revenue declined by 1.3% and outpatient revenue increased by 7.6%. The decline in inpatient revenue in 2010 was primarily due to a 4.1% decline in the average number of inpatient programs operated, partially offset by a 2.9% increase in average revenue per program. The increase in average revenue per program reflects same store inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) revenue and discharge growth of 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, compared to 2009. HRS operated 105 IRF programs as of December 31, 2010 compared to 106 as of December 31, 2009. The increase in outpatient revenue in 2010 reflects a 23.2% increase in average revenue per program due to a 9.3% increase in outpatient same store revenues, a 7.6% increase in same store outpatient units of service and a significant change in contract mix. The average number of outpatient units operated declined by 12.7% in 2010. Hospitals. Hospitals segment revenues increased $459.0 million or 263.5% from 2009 to 2010. Triumph, including the impact of new locations in Philadelphia and Houston Heights, contributed incremental revenues of $413.0 million in 2010. The increase in revenues in 2010 also reflects the June 2009 acquisition of an LTACH in Dallas, Texas and the August 2009 opening of an LTACH in Peoria, Illinois, which became certified as an LTACH effective May 1, 2010. Same store revenues increased by $12.7 million or 10.1% in 2010 reflecting a 3.1% increase in same store patient discharges and a 7.9% increase in same store revenue per patient day primarily attributable to improved case management. Cost and Expenses % of % of 2010 Revenue 2009 Revenue (dollars in thousands) Consolidated costs and expenses: Operating expenses $ 1,056,671 79.5 % $ 684,312 80.7 % Selling, general and administrative 108,618 8.2 107,130 12.6 Depreciation and amortization 30,595 2.3 16,250 1.9 Total costs and expenses $ 1,195,884 90.0 % $ 807,692 95.2 % Operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues as a result of improved operating performance by our hospitals segment, particularly our legacy hospitals. Triumph also contributed to the hospital segments improvement in 2010. This impact was partially offset by an increase in SRSs and HRSs operating expenses as explained below. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the increase in consolidated revenues, resulting in improved fixed overhead leverage, combined with the cost savings achieved by corporate and division realignment activities completed in 2009 and a reduction in corporate senior management incentive costs incurred in 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2009 also included approximately $7.2 million of external costs associated with the Triumph acquisition. Our provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses. On a consolidated basis, the provision for doubtful accounts increased by $2.6 million from $7.5 million in 2009 to $10.1 million in 2010. Triumph, which was acquired in November 2009, recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of $3.6 million and $0.3 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 36 % of % of Unit Unit 2010 Revenue 2009 Revenue (dollars in thousands) Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services: Operating expenses $ 423,399 82.0 % $ 402,461 81.1 % Selling, general and administrative 48,172 9.3 49,753 10.0 Depreciation and amortization 5,523 1.1 6,283 1.3 Total costs and expenses $ 477,094 92.4 % $ 458,497 92.4 % Hospital Rehabilitation Services: Operating expenses $ 127,550 70.9 % $ 124,758 70.0 % Selling, general and administrative 17,312 9.6 21,500 12.1 Depreciation and amortization 2,222 1.2 2,423 1.3 Total costs and expenses $ 147,084 81.7 % $ 148,681 83.4 % Hospitals: Operating expenses $ 505,722 79.9 % $ 157,093 90.2 % Selling, general and administrative 43,134 6.8 35,623 20.5 Depreciation and amortization 22,850 3.6 7,544 4.3 Total costs and expenses $ 571,706 90.3 % $ 200,260 115.0 % Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services (SRS). Total SRS costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue remained flat in 2010 compared to 2009. Direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue as a 3.9% increase in contract therapy labor and benefit costs per minute of service more than offset increases in average contract therapy revenue per minute. The increase in labor costs is primarily the result of lower therapist productivity in 2010 which we believe was negatively impacted by the rollout of our new point of service technologies to approximately 60% of our units, the transition to Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 and a shift away from concurrent therapy to therapy in individual settings. This shift to therapy in individual settings began in September 2010 in anticipation of reimbursement rule changes on concurrent therapy that went into effect on October 1, 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of unit revenue declined in 2010 primarily as a result of improvements in fixed overhead leverage combined with lower corporate and division management incentive costs. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as certain fixed assets and intangible assets became fully amortized in 2010 and 2009. As a result of these factors combined with higher revenues, SRSs operating earnings increased by approximately $1.4 million from $37.8 million in 2009 to $39.2 million in 2010. Hospital Rehabilitation Services (HRS). Total HRS costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in 2010 primarily due to a change in our outpatient contract mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of improvements in fixed overhead leverage combined with cost savings from corporate and division realignment activities that were completed in 2009 and a reduction in corporate senior management incentive costs. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as certain fixed assets became fully amortized in 2009. HRSs operating earnings increased from $29.5 million in 2009 to $32.9 million in 2010. 37 Hospitals. Total hospital segment costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue declined from 2009 to 2010 reflecting the incremental profit contributed by the Triumph hospitals, improved operating performance by our legacy hospitals and improved leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses. Combined start up and ramp up losses decreased from $4.8 million in 2009 to $1.6 million in 2010. The 2009 losses primarily related to the ramp up of our LTACH in Kansas City, Missouri and start up of our LTACH in Peoria, Illinois while the 2010 losses relate entirely to the start up and ramp up of our LTACH in Peoria, Illinois. Additionally, the Dallas LTAC Hospital, which was acquired on June 30, 2009, improved its operating earnings by approximately $6.9 million from 2009 to 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior year largely due to improvements in fixed overhead leverage combined with a $9.9 million decrease in merger, acquisition and joint venture development expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with Triumph but declined as a percentage of revenue. The hospital segment generated operating earnings of $61.5 million in 2010 compared to an operating loss of $26.1 million in 2009. The Triumph hospitals contributed operating earnings of $64.1 million and $3.7 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Non operating Items Interest expense increased from $5.5 million in 2009 to $33.2 million in 2010 primarily due to the net increase in borrowings which occurred in connection with funding the November 24, 2009 acquisition of Triumph. The balances outstanding on all forms of indebtedness were $398.5 million and $464.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These balances exclude unamortized original issue discounts. Interest expense includes interest incurred on all borrowings, amortization of deferred loan origination fees, amortization of original issue discounts, commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $101.4 million in 2010 from $35.9 million in 2009. The provision for income taxes was $36.6 million in 2010 and $16.3 million in 2009. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 37.4% in 2010 and 43.0% in 2009. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflects a lower overall weighted average statutory state tax rate resulting from the Triumph acquisition and a smaller unfavorable effective tax rate impact of permanent tax differences due to increased taxable income. In addition, during the second quarter of 2010, we recognized a $0.8 million tax benefit for the combined impact of the reversal of a contingency reserve due to a favorable ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service and the benefit of tax credits identified during the quarter. Finally, the higher effective tax rate in 2009 reflects the fact that certain acquisition related expenses incurred in connection with the Triumph transaction were not deductible for tax purposes. We recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of approximately $1.2 million in 2010 and $1.4 million in 2009. Such income primarily relates to the operations of our Miami hospital, which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010. Income from discontinued operations in 2009 is net of a $0.7 million after tax loss on the sale of Phase 2. Net earnings (losses) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries were $3.7 million and $(2.0) million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Nearly all of our consolidated subsidiaries with a noncontrolling interest were profitable in 2010. The net losses in 2009 primarily relate to the recognition of the noncontrolling interests share of the losses incurred by our hospitals in Peoria, Kansas City and Dallas. Net earnings attributable to RehabCare were $62.5 million in 2010 compared to $23.0 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share attributable to RehabCare were $2.53 in 2010 compared to $1.22 in 2009. 38 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 Revenues 2009 2008 % Change (dollars in thousands) Skilled nursing rehabilitation services $ 496,250 $ 457,229 8.5 % Hospital rehabilitation services 178,168 165,658 7.6 Hospitals 174,194 91,143 91.1 Consolidated revenues $ 848,612 $ 714,030 18.8 % Consolidated operating revenues increased from $714.0 million in 2008 to $848.6 million in 2009 due to growth in each of our business units. Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services (SRS). SRS operating revenues increased $39.0 million or 8.5% from 2008 to 2009. Same store contract therapy revenues grew 8.8% reflecting a 5.7% increase in same store minutes of service. Higher average daily census, improved therapist productivity, a market basket adjustment for skilled nursing facilities which became effective October 1, 2008 and the continued development and implementation of clinical programs contributed to the growth in same store revenues. The average number of contract therapy locations operated during 2009 grew 2.1% compared to 2008. Hospital Rehabilitation Services (HRS). HRS operating revenues increased 7.6% in 2009 as inpatient revenue increased 6.6% and outpatient revenue increased 10.4%. Inpatient average revenue per program increased 7.7% in 2009 reflecting a favorable change in the divisions contract mix which included a 2.7% increase in the average number of inpatient rehabilitation facility programs operated in 2009. In addition, same store revenues for inpatient rehabilitation facilities grew 2.4% and same store discharges increased 1.2% compared to 2008. The increase in outpatient revenue in 2009 reflects a 6.7% increase in the average number of units operated and a 7.4% increase in same store revenues. Hospitals. Hospitals segment revenues increased $83.1 million or 91.1% from 2008 to 2009. The acquisition of Triumph contributed incremental revenues of $39.7 million in 2009. The increase in revenues in 2009 also reflects the June 2009 acquisition of an LTACH in Dallas, the June 2008 acquisition of The Specialty Hospital in Rome, Georgia, the November 2008 opening of a rehabilitation hospital in St. Louis, Missouri and the December 2008 certification of an LTACH in Kansas City, Missouri. Same store revenues increased by $9.4 million or 11.4% in 2009 as compared to 2008. One LTACH hospital contributed $5.4 million to the same store revenue growth primarily as a result of an increase in patient census. Cost and Expenses % of % of 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue (dollars in thousands) Consolidated costs and expenses: Operating expenses $ 684,312 80.7 % $ 579,179 81.1 % Selling, general and administrative 107,130 12.6 92,177 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 16,250 1.9 14,375 2.0 Total costs and expenses $ 807,692 95.2 % $ 685,731 96.0 % 39 Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved operating performances by all of our businesses. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects the increase in revenues combined with the cost savings achieved by eliminating approximately 60 corporate and division support positions in the second half of 2008. These cost savings were more than offset by, an increase in both long term and short term management incentives, reflecting our improved overall performance , and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our hospital segment including approximately $7.2 million of external costs associated with the Triumph acquisition. Our provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses. On a consolidated basis, the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $1.1 million from $8.6 million in 2008 to $7.5 million in 2009. Our HRS business decreased its provision by $1.2 million in 2009. HRS recorded a $1.2 million specific provision in 2008 related to our trade and note receivables due from Signature Healthcare Foundation. This specific provision was a result of Signatures deteriorating financial condition during 2008. In February 2009, we terminated our staffing agreement with Signature and took possession of Signatures operating assets in full satisfaction of our receivables from Signature. % of % of Unit Unit 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue (dollars in thousands) Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services: Operating expenses $ 402,461 81.1 % $ 373,939 81.8 % Selling, general and administrative 49,753 10.0 50,911 11.1 Depreciation and amortization 6,283 1.3 6,835 1.5 Total costs and expenses $ 458,497 92.4 % $ 431,685 94.4 % Hospital Rehabilitation Services: Operating expenses $ 124,758 70.0 % $ 118,291 71.4 % Selling, general and administrative 21,500 12.1 22,729 13.7 Depreciation and amortization 2,423 1.3 2,641 1.6 Total costs and expenses $ 148,681 83.4 % $ 143,661 86.7 % Hospitals: Operating expenses $ 157,093 90.2 % $ 86,949 95.4 % Selling, general and administrative 35,623 20.5 17,806 19.5 Depreciation and amortization 7,544 4.3 4,899 5.4 Total costs and expenses $ 200,260 115.0 % $ 109,654 120.3 % Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Services (SRS). Total SRS costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in therapist productivity and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses declined as a percentage of unit revenue primarily due to a reduction in labor and benefit costs as a percentage of revenue. This was driven by therapist productivity improvements and lower contract labor usage in 2009 which more than offset the impact of wage rate and benefit cost increases. Improved therapist retention and a reduction in the time to fill permanent positions may have contributed to the decreased use of contract labor. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the cost savings achieved from the division and corporate realignment activities that were completed in the second half of 2008. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower depreciation associated with capitalized software which became fully depreciated in 2008. As a result of these factors combined with higher revenues, SRSs operating earnings increased by approximately $12.3 million from $25.5 million in 2008 to $37.8 million in 2009. 40 Hospital Rehabilitation Services (HRS). Total HRS costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to improved operating performance and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses decreased as a percentage of unit revenue in 2009 reflecting a favorable change in the divisions contract mix, which included an additional 2.9 IRF programs on average in 2009 as compared to 2008 as well as a lower provision for doubtful accounts primarily due the charge taken in 2008 for receivables from Signature. While the average number of IRF programs increased from 2008 to 2009, the actual number of IRF programs declined from 113 at the beginning of 2009 to 106 as of December 31, 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of corporate and division realignment activities during late 2008 and early 2009, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower depreciation associated with capitalized software which became fully depreciated in 2008. HRSs operating earnings increased from $22.0 million in 2008 to $29.5 million in 2009. Hospitals. Total hospital segment costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased from 2008 to 2009. Operating expenses decreased as a percentage of unit revenue in 2009 primarily as a result of improved operating performance by our legacy LTACHs in 2009. In addition, Triumphs hospitals generated operating profit of $3.7 million or 9.3% of revenue during the 37 days we owned Triumph in 2009. Combined start up and ramp up losses declined from $5.8 million in 2008 to $4.8 million in 2009. The 2009 losses relate primarily to the start up of our LTACH in Peoria, Illinois and the ramp up of our LTACH in Kansas City. We define the ramp up phase for an LTACH as the period during which the hospital attempts to build its patient census following the receipt of its LTACH Medicare provider number. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from the prior year largely due to costs incurred for acquisition and joint venture development activities and an investment in back office resources to support the growth of the business. In 2009, we incurred $7.2 million of acquisition related expenses for outside costs directly related to the acquisition of Triumph and another $3.5 million of expenses for outside services related to other acquisition related activities. In 2008, we incurred $1.8 million of expense related to outside services for canceled acquisitions and joint venture development projects. On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations which requires us to expense all acquisition related costs. Prior to January 1, 2009, outside service costs incurred for consummated transactions were capitalized as a component of the acquisition cost and only costs related to canceled transactions were expensed. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with Triumph and our other new facilities. As a result of these factors, the hospital segment incurred operating losses of $26.1 million in 2009 and $18.5 million in 2008. Non operating Items Interest expense increased from $3.9 million in 2008 to $5.5 million in 2009 primarily due to the net increase in borrowings which occurred in connection with funding the November 24, 2009 acquisition of Triumph. The balances outstanding on all forms of indebtedness were $464.2 million and $57.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense includes interest incurred on all our borrowings, amortization of deferred loan origination fees, amortization of original issue discounts, commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $35.9 million in 2009 from $25.0 million in 2008. The provision for income taxes was $16.3 million in 2009 compared to $10.3 million in 2008. The provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was 43.0% in 2009 and 38.2% in 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2009 reflects the fact that certain acquisition related expenses incurred in connection with the Triumph transaction were not deductible for tax purposes. 41 We recorded income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of approximately $1.4 million in 2009 and $2.0 million in 2008. Such income primarily relates to our Miami hospital, which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010. Discontinued operations also include Phase 2, which was sold in the second quarter of 2009, and a rehabilitation hospital located in Midland, Texas, which was sold in the third quarter of 2008. The Company incurred an after tax loss of approximately $0.7 million on the sale of Phase 2 in 2009. Net losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries were $2.0 million in both 2009 and 2008. The 2009 losses primarily relate to our hospitals in Peoria, Dallas and Kansas City while the 2008 losses primarily relate to our hospitals in Kansas City and St. Louis. Net earnings attributable to RehabCare were $23.0 million in 2009 compared to $18.7 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share attributable to RehabCare were $1.22 in 2009 compared to $1.05 in 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $23.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a current ratio, the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.7 to 1. Net working capital increased by $6.7 million to $117.6 million at December 31, 2010 as compared to $110.9 million at December 31, 2009. Net accounts receivable were $222.2 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $199.4 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in net accounts receivable occurred primarily in our hospital segment and is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues. In addition, our Peoria hospital recently received its LTACH provider number and has retroactively billed Medicare back to May 1, 2010. Including Triumph, the number of days sales outstanding (DSO) in net receivables was 61.9, 60.2 and 66.0 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We generated cash from operations of $103.8 million, $48.1 million and $48.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures were $30.6 million, $13.2 million and $18.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction of new hospitals, investments in information technology systems, equipment additions and replacements and various other capital improvements. Over the next few years, we plan to continue to invest in information technology systems and the development and renovation of hospitals. As noted earlier, Triumphs results of operations have been included in our financial statements prospectively beginning after the date of acquisition. We have historically financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments. We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital, capital expenditures, internal and external business expansion, and debt service requirements. On November 24, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Credit Agreement provides for a five year revolving credit facility of $125 million and a swingline subfacility of up to $25 million. At December 31, 2010, the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was $1.4 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had $11.8 million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims. The letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2010, after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants, the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately $111.8 million. 42 The Credit Agreement also provided for a six year $450 million term loan facility. At December 31, 2010, the balance outstanding under the term loan was $385.5 million. The term loan facility requires quarterly installments of $1,125,000 with the balance payable upon the final maturity. In addition, we are required to make mandatory principal prepayments equal to a portion of our consolidated excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) when our consolidated leverage ratio reaches certain levels. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, dividends, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in similar credit facilities. In addition, we are required to maintain on a consolidated basis a maximum ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA as defined in the Credit Agreement), a maximum ratio of senior funded debt to EBITDA and a minimum ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and operating lease expense (Adjusted EBITDAR as defined in the Credit Agreement) to fixed charges. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. If we anticipate a potential covenant violation, we would seek relief from our lenders; however, such relief might not be granted or might be granted on terms less favorable than those in our existing Credit Agreement. In 2009, we issued 6,210,000 shares of our common stock in a public equity offering which resulted in net proceeds, after underwriting fees and other direct costs, of approximately $140.2 million. We used the net proceeds from the public equity offering along with the proceeds from our term loan facility to pay for the majority of the consideration used to acquire Triumph. Inflation Although inflation has abated during the last several years, the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole. Our management contracts often provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices. Effect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): 43 Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years Other Operating leases (1) $ 483,600 $ 32,154 $ 73,601 $ 73,469 $ 304,376 $ Purchase obligations (2) 3,620 1,158 2,462 Long term debt including capital lease obligations (3) 398,479 9,116 13,405 375,958 Interest on long term debt (4) 111,690 23,737 45,787 42,166 Unrecognized tax benefits (5) 1,532 1,532 Other long term liabilities (6) 3,958 3,958 Total $ 1,002,879 $ 66,165 $ 135,255 $ 491,593 $ 304,376 $ 5,490 (1) We lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. For more information, see Note 13 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (3) The amount of long term debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 includes unamortized original issue discounts of approximately $7,591,000. (4) Interest on our variable rate debt is estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2010. This line also includes interest related to capital lease obligations, but excludes the amortization of original issue discounts and the amortization of deferred loan fees. (5) Represents our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, which involve various taxing authorities. As a result, we are unable to predict the timing of payments against this obligation. (6) We maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees. Under the plan, participants may defer up to 70% of their salary and cash incentive compensation. The amounts are held in trust in investments designated by participants but remain our property until distribution. Because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants, we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation. At December 31, 2010, we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors. 44 Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include accounting for business combinations, estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, estimating contractual allowances, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health, workers compensation and professional liability claims. In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired, intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill. We engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The significant purchased intangible assets recorded by RehabCare include customer contracts, trade names and Medicare provider numbers. Critical estimates in valuing these intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates, the assets remaining economic life and future expected cash flows generated by the assets. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances. We determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts, historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable. We specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In our hospitals segment, the primary collection risks relate to the amounts for which the patient is responsible (deductibles and co payments). Our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2010 was $222.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $24.3 million. Our estimates of collectability require significant judgment. If our customers ability to make payments to us were to deteriorate beyond the levels estimated, additional allowances may be required. We continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified. Contractual Allowances. Our hospitals recognize net patient revenue in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates, less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances. An individual patients bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payors following their review of each particular bill. We estimate the discounts for contractual allowances using the balance sheet approach on an individual hospital basis. Patient accounts receivable detail is analyzed to determine expected reimbursement for each patient. Expected reimbursement is summarized by payor classification and reconciled to the balance sheet. A secondary review is completed at the consolidated hospitals level to validate calculations. Estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration Medicare reimbursement rules and known changes to contract terms, laws and regulations and payment history. If such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated, we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination. 45 Laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount. The estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined. We did not record any significant adjustments for prior year Medicare or Medicaid cost reports in 2010, 2009 or 2008. We are not aware of any material claims, disputes, or unsettled matters with third party payors. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets, both tangible and intangible, based on estimated fair values. Costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Under GAAP, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment. If the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value. No impairments of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives were identified during the three years ended December 31, 2010. As required by GAAP, we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill, by comparing the reporting units fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our primary reporting units are our skilled nursing rehabilitation services, hospital rehabilitation services and hospital businesses. We calculated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates. These assumptions are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations, and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies. We believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate; however, different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur. At December 31, 2010, unamortized goodwill related to our skilled nursing rehabilitation services, hospital rehabilitation services and hospitals businesses was $79.4 million, $39.7 million and $440.7 million, respectively. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2010. Our most recent impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2010. A 10% decrease in the calculated fair value of each of our reporting units as of December 31, 2010 would not have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment. However, for our hospitals reporting unit, a 15% decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit would have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment. The amount of impairment loss, if any, would be determined during the second step of the impairment test. 46 Health, Workers Compensation, and Professional Liability Insurance Accruals. We maintain an accrual for our health, workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages (health insurance) and accrued expenses (workers compensation and professional liability) in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, the combined amount of these accruals was approximately $23.1 million. We determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health, workers compensation, and professional liability claims and payments, based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends. In analyzing the accruals, we also consider the nature and severity of the claims, analyses provided by third party claims administrators, as well as current legal, economic and regulatory factors. If such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated, we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination. The ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals. While we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate, there can be no assurances that changes to managements estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. We are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. Some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters. Our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims, governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals. From time to time, and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances, we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters. Although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us, if we become aware of such claims against us, we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary. Forward Looking Statements This annual report contains historical information, as well as forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to future events, our future financial performance or our projected business results. In some cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, targets, potential, or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are made on the basis of our views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. We caution investors that any such forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from anticipated results or expectations expressed in our forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, some of the factors that could impact our business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on certain borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Interest rate changes on variable rate debt impact our interest expense and cash flows, but do not impact the fair value of the underlying debt instruments. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at either a base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for one, two, three or six month interest periods, or a nine or twelve month period if available, plus an applicable margin percentage. The base rate is the greater of the federal funds rate plus one half of 1%, Bank of America N.A.s prime rate or one month LIBOR plus 1%. The applicable margin percentage is based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2010, the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was $1.4 million and the interest rate on such borrowings was 5.75%. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate charged on the revolving credit facility would result in additional interest expense of approximately $14,000 on an annualized basis. 47 Borrowings under our term loan facility bear interest at our option at either the base rate plus 300 basis points or LIBOR plus 400 basis points with a LIBOR floor of 200 basis points. As of December 31, 2010, the balance outstanding against the term loan facility was $385.5 million. At December 31, 2010, the term loan facility was subject to a one month LIBOR contract and the one month LIBOR rate was 0.26% resulting in an all in interest rate of 6.0% due to the 2.0% LIBOR floor and the 400 basis point margin. Based on the $385.5 million of term loan debt outstanding at December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point increase in the one month LIBOR rate would result in no additional interest expense (as a result of the LIBOR floor). A 200 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate would result in additional interest expense of approximately $1.0 million on an annualized basis. At December 31, 2010, we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments. 48
