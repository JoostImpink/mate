Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation The following discussion of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys financial statements and related notes and other statistical information included in this report. Overview Consolidated income of the Company is derived primarily from operations of the Bank. Net income for 2006 was $7,400,369 compared to $6,797,638 for 2005 and $5,613,187 for 2004. The Company had a return on average equity of 10.87% and return on average assets of 1.97% for 2006, compared to returns on average equity of 10.01% and 8.64%, and returns on average assets of 1.71% and 1.42%, for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Results of Operations The Companys net income of $7,400,369, or $2.33 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, was an increase of $602,731 or 8.87%, from net income of $6,797,638, or $2.13 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Contributing to this increase was a $1,050,666 (6.60%) increase in net interest income. Noninterest revenue increased $149,370 (8.30%) from 2005 to 2006, while noninterest expense increased $195,005 (2.72%) during the same period. The Companys net income of $6,797,638, or $2.13 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005, was an increase of $1,184,451 or 21.10%, from the net income of $5,613,187, or $1.74 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Contributing to this increase was a $2,213,985 (16.16%) increase in net interest income. Noninterest revenue increased $49,577 (2.83%) from 2004 to in 2005, while noninterest expense increased $351,211 (5.16%) during the same period. The Companys net income of $1,831,259 or $.58 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, was an increase of $127,316, or 7.47%, from the net income of $1,703,943 or $.53 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. Increased net interest income, the primary reason for the increase, was due to a second year of continued growth in the Banks loan portfolio and higher earnings rates on the Banks investments. Deposit interest expense increased due to rate increases targeted at deposit retention. The Companys net income of $1,703,943 or $.53 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, was an increase of $252,597, or 17.40%, from the net income of $1,451,346 or $.45 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Increased net interest income, the primary reason for the increase, was due to growth in the Banks loan portfolio and higher earnings rates on the Banks investments. Deposit interest expense increased due to rate increases, but the effect on earnings was ameliorated by a reduction in the volume of time deposits. Net Interest Income The primary source of income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between revenue on interest earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and interest incurred on interest bearing sources of funds, such as deposits and borrowings. The level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balance of interest earning assets and the Companys funding sources and the various rate spreads between the interest earning assets and funding sources. Changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities. The volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is affected by the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio, which includes loans, and the availability of particular sources of funds, such as noninterest bearing deposits. The key performance measure for net interest income is the "net margin on interest earning assets," or net interest income divided by average interest earning assets. The Companys net interest margin for 2006 on a non GAAP tax equivalent basis, was 5.02%, compared to 4.45% and 3.88% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Because most of the Banks loans are written with a demand feature, the income of the Bank should not change dramatically as interest rates change. Management of the Company expects to maintain the net margin on interest earning assets. The net margin may decline, however, if competition increases, loan demand decreases, or the cost of funds rises faster than the return on loans and securities. Although such expectations are based on managements judgment, actual results will depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty, and fulfillment of managements expectations cannot be assured. The following tables present information including average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the amount of related interest income and interest expense, and the resulting yields by category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability. In these tables, dividends and interest on tax exempt securities and loans are reported on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which is a non GAAP measure as defined in SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S K. Management believes that these measures provide better yield comparability as a tool for managing net interest income. 10  Average Balances, Interest, and Yields (Dollars stated in thousands) For the Year Ended For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 Average Average Average Balance Interest Yield Balance Interest Yield Balance Interest Yield Assets Federal funds sold $ 22,547 $ 1,137 5.04% $ 34,233 $ 1,078 3.15% $ 41,762 $ 547 1.31% Interest bearing deposits 2,173 79 3.64% 2,175 56 2.56% 2,201 48 2.16% Investment securities: U.

Composition of Loan Portfolio Because loans are expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets (assuming that loan losses are not excessive), the absolute volume of loans and the volume as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin. Average loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, were $224,693,000, $184,439,000, and $161,481,000 during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, which constituted 65.40%, 50.60%, and 44.66% of average interest earning assets for the periods. The Companys loan to deposit ratio was 79.65%, 65.77%, and 50.51% at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Average loans to average deposits were 75.04%, 57.24%, and 49.90% for 2006, 2005, and 2004. The increase in the loan to deposit ratio from 2005 to 2006 is attributable to 21.83% growth in the average loan portfolio accompanied by a 7.08% reduction in average deposits during 2006. Throughout 2005 and 2006, the Bank continued to enjoy increased loan opportunity due to steady demand and competitive pricing. The Company extends loans primarily to customers located in and near Worcester County, Maryland and Sussex County, Delaware. There are no industry concentrations in the Companys loan portfolio. The Company does, however, have a substantial portion of its loans in real estate and performance will be influenced by the real estate market in the region. 12 The following table sets forth the composition of the Companys loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company has the following commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  2006 2005 2004 Construction and land development loans $ 18,866,083 $ 21,845,161 $ 7,294,592 Other loan commitments 21,557,185 24,252,637 21,276,025 Standby letters of credit 1,682,942 1,272,000 1,535,210 Total $ 42,106,210 $ 47,369,798 $ 30,105,827 Loan commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract. Loan commitments may have interest fixed at current rates, fixed expiration dates, and may require the payment of a fee. Letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Loan commitments and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as outstanding loans. The Companys exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contract amount of the commitment. 14 Loan Quality The allowance for loan losses represents an allowance for potential losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans, with a particular emphasis on non accruing, past due, and other loans that management believes require attention. The determination of the allowance rests upon managements judgment about factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economy. Management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover possible losses in the loan portfolio; however, managements judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events, which are believed to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan loss or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required. It is the Companys policy to evaluate loan portfolio risk for the purpose of establishing an adequate allowance. The allowance may include reserves for specific loans identified as substandard during managements loan review. For significant problem loans, managements review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrowers and guarantors, the related collateral, and the effects of economic conditions. The overall evaluation of the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of historical loan losses ratios, loan charge offs, delinquency trends, and previous collection experience, along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions. The recent slow down in the real estate market has affected both the price and time to market residential and commercial properties. Management closely monitors such trends and the potential effect on the Company. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate. No provision for loan losses was made in 2006, 2005, or 2004 due to low levels of delinquencies. Generally, the Company will not require a negative provision to reduce the allowance as a result of either net recoveries, or a decrease in loans. Substantially all of the balance of the allowance as of December 31 2006, 2005, and 2004, is "general" in nature, that is, it cannot be specifically allocated among the major categories of loans in any meaningful manner. Management believes that this is consistent with the Companys history of conservative underwriting, high asset quality, low levels of delinquency, and minimal loan losses. As of December 31, 2006, the allowance for loan losses was ..93% of outstanding loans, down from 1.06% at December 31, 2005, and 1.33% at December 31, 2004.

These loans are classified as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrowers financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recognized as a reduction of principal. A delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days or more past due. When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all interest that has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. Nonperforming loans are loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing plus nonaccrual loans. When real estate acquired in foreclosure and held for sale is included with nonperforming loans, the result comprises nonperforming assets. There were no nonperforming assets other than nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, or 2002, as shown in the following table.  2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing $ 239,620 $ 131,717 $ 391,676 $ 315,395 $ 282,856 Nonaccruing loans 2,222 Total nonperforming loans $ 239,620 $ 131,717 $ 391,676 $ 315,395 $ 285,078 Loans are classified as impaired when the collection of contractual obligations, including principal and interest, is doubtful. Management has identified no significant impaired loans as of December 31, 2006, 2005, or 2004. Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity The primary objective of asset/liability management is to ensure the steady growth of the Companys primary source of earnings, net interest income. Net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements. To lessen the impact of these margin swings, the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals. Imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute interest rate sensitivity. Liquidity represents the ability to provide steady sources of funds for loan commitments and investment activities, as well as to provide sufficient funds to cover deposit withdrawals and payment of debt and operating obligations. These funds can be obtained by converting assets to cash or by attracting new deposits. Average liquid assets (cash and amounts due from banks, interest bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities) were 45.61% of average deposits for 2006, compared to 62.06% and 67.94% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. 16 As of December 31, 2006, $48,945,961, or 68.93% of the investment debt securities mature in one year or less, of which, $11,919,970 are classified as "available for sale." Federal funds sold provide additional liquidity. Other sources of liquidity include letters of credit, overnight federal funds, and reverse repurchase agreements available from correspondent banks.

The rate sensitive position, or gap, is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a given time interval. The general objective of gap management is to actively manage rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest margin. Management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize the overall interest rate risk to the Company. Interest rate sensitivity may be controlled on either side of the balance sheet. On the asset side, management exercises some control over maturities. Also, loans are written to provide repricing opportunities on fixed rate notes. The Companys investment portfolio, including federal funds sold, provides the most flexible and fastest control over rate sensitivity since it can generally be restructured more quickly than the loan portfolio. On the liability side, deposit products are structured to offer incentives to attain the maturity distribution desired. Competitive factors sometimes make control over deposits more difficult and, therefore, less effective as an interest rate sensitivity management tool. The asset mix of the balance sheet is continually evaluated in terms of several variables: yield, credit quality, appropriate funding sources, and liquidity. Management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources. 17 As of December 31, 2006, the Company was cumulatively asset sensitive for all time horizons. For asset sensitive institutions, if interest rates should decrease, the net interest margins should decline. Since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity, the gap is only a general indicator of rate sensitivity.

Average interest bearing deposits decreased $21,654,000, or 9.15%, to $215,033,000 in 2006 from $236,687,000 in 2005, while average noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased $1,146,000, or 1.34% to $84,380,000 in 2006 from $85,526,000 in 2005. At December 31, 2006, total deposits were $290,324,760, compared to $310,857,607 at December 31, 2005, a decrease of 6.60%. Average interest bearing liabilities decreased $2,116,000, or ..86%, from $245,279,000 in 2004, to $243,163,000 in 2005. Average interest bearing deposits decreased $3,400,000, or 1.42%, from $240,087,000 in 2004 to $236,687,000 in 2005, while average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $2,028,000, or 2.43% from $83,498,000 in 2004 to $85,526,000 in 2005. At December 31, 2005, total deposits were $310,857,607, compared to $319,772,358 at December 31, 2004, a decrease of 2.79%. Management believes that decreasing deposit volume through 2005 and 2006 is indicative of a return by investors to non deposit investment products and strong competition for deposits in the local market. Management monitors deposit decreases closely and implements counter measures as needed, including but not limited to rate increases on existing products and the development of new products. 18 The following table sets forth the deposits of the Company by category as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Percent of Percent of Percent of Amount deposits Amount deposits Amount deposits Demand deposit accounts $ 79,625,853 27.43% $ 88,236,133 28.39% $ 78,542,414 24.56% NOW accounts 54,458,814 18.76% 62,601,973 20.14% 68,892,269 21.55% Money market 36,413,676 12.54% 46,464,340 14.95% 49,362,532 15.44% Savings accounts 45,844,558 15.79% 51,648,088 16.61% 53,667,019 16.78% Time deposits less than $100,000 46,020,077 15.85% 44,028,847 14.16% 50,683,867 15.85% Time deposits of $100,000 or more 27,961,782 9.63% 17,878,226 5.75% 18,624,257 5.82% Total deposits $ 290,324,760 100.00% $ 310,857,607 100.00% $ 319,772,358 100.00% Core deposits, which exclude certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, provide a relatively stable funding source for the Companys loan portfolio and other earning assets. The Companys core deposits decreased $30,616,403 during 2006 and $8,168,720 during 2005. Management attributes this decrease to more aggressive competition for time deposits in the rising rate environment of 2006 and 2005. Rate increases implemented to retain deposits have caused a shift of funds from core deposits into time deposits of $100,000 or more. During this period, as in the previous year, management believes there has been a reversal of some of the 2001 through 2004 migration of funds from the stock market into insured deposits. Deposits, and particularly core deposits, have been the Companys primary source of funding and have enabled the Company to meet both its short term and long term liquidity needs. Management anticipates that while such deposits will continue to be the Companys primary source of funding in the future, continued reductions in deposit levels, if coupled with growth in the Companys loan portfolio, could require periodic borrowing of funds. In this event, it is likely that Management would liquidate investment securities from the available for sale portfolio or purchase overnight federal funds as needed. The maturity distribution of the Companys time deposits of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2006, is shown in the following table. Maturities of Certificates of Deposit and Other Time Deposits of $100,000 or More December 31, 2006 After six After three through Within three Through twelve After twelve months six months months months Total Time of deposits of $100,000 or more $ 10,632,910 $ 10,796,797 $ 5,641,345 $ 890,730 $ 27,961,782 Large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels, making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits. Some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers. These brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources. Accordingly, the Company does not accept brokered deposits. 19 Noninterest revenue Noninterest revenue for 2006 increased $149,370, or 8.30% from the previous year. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $65,715, or 6.24%, due to fee increases effective in early January 2006. ATM and debit card revenue increased $75,776, or 20.35%, due to a combination of fee increases and card usage. Noninterest revenue for 2005 increased $49,577, or 2.83% from the previous year. Of this, $49,710, representing a 15.40% line item increase, is attributable to revenues from ATM and VISA debit card usage. The following table presents the principal components of noninterest revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  2006 2005 2004 Service charges on deposit accounts $ 1,119,158 $ 1,053,443 $ 1,050,504 ATM and debit card revenue 448,202 372,426 322,716 Miscellaneous revenue 381,384 373,505 376,577 Total noninterest revenue $ 1,948,744 $ 1,799,374 $ 1,749,797 Noninterest revenue as a percentage of average total assets 0.52% 0.45% 0.44% Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased $195,005, or 2.72%, from 2005 to 2006. Increased personnel costs of $159,652 include a $48,300 cash bonus paid in February 2006, and a $28,197 increase in expense related to the Banks employee retirement plan. Occupancy expense increased $69,284 which includes a $29,430, or 24.93%, increase in utility costs. Furniture and equipment expense are down $12,404, which is attributable to lower depreciation expense. Other operating expense decreased $21,527, as the net result of several increases and decreases. Increased directors fees resulted from a fee increase, an additional Board seat, and one additional meeting in 2006 as compared to 2005. Postage costs are down by $30,200 due to the timing of as needed meter replenishment, and the Companys efforts to reduce unnecessary mailings. Professional fees in 2005 included non recurring consulting fees of $19,052. Noninterest expense increased $351,211, or 5.16%, from 2004 to 2005. Increased personnel costs of $194,255 include a $37,487 increase in expense related to the Banks employee retirement plan and the accrual of a 10 year commitment, valued at $107,409, to provide long term care insurance to the Chairman of the Board. Occupancy expense increased $46,860 due to routine increases in costs of utilities, real property taxes, and insurance, in addition to several significant repairs. Furniture and equipment expense are down $60,766, of which $26,769 is reduced depreciation expense, and $21,944 is lower cost of service contracts and repairs. Other operating expense increased $170,862, including a $29,452 increase in telephone and network telecommunications. 20 The following table presents the principal components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.  2006 2005 2004 Salaries and employee benefits $ 4,257,185 $ 4,097,533 $ 3,903,278 Occupancy expense 709,619 640,335 593,475 Furniture and equipment expense 478,551 490,955 551,721 Advertising 166,441 147,541 145,583 Armored car service 52,513 76,068 60,829 ATM and debit card 234,409 234,732 232,353 Business and product development 79,623 78,399 70,720 Computer software amortization 111,765 121,982 117,191 Computer software maintenance 111,777 101,875 82,514 Courier service 108,961 105,148 103,922 Deposit insurance 36,275 42,098 45,403 Director fees 140,200 99,900 89,375 Dues, donations, and subscriptions 88,255 94,385 81,328 Liability insurance 39,402 40,380 41,556 Postage 149,262 179,462 169,569 Professional fees 41,337 65,090 22,745 Stationery and supplies 123,652 111,593 135,269 Telephone 170,960 152,464 123,012 Miscellaneous 254,500 279,742 238,628 Total noninterest expense $ 7,354,687 $ 7,159,682 $ 6,808,471 Noninterest expense as a percentage of average total assets 1.96% 1.80% 1.73% 21 Capital Under capital guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, the Company and the Bank are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of 8%, with at least 4% being Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders equity, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less certain intangibles. In addition, the Company and the Bank must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of at least 4%, but this minimum ratio is increased by 100 to 200 basis points for other than the highest rated institutions. At December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company and the Bank were well capitalized, exceeding all minimum requirements, as set forth in the following table.

The Companys periodic SEC reports, including annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, and current reports on Form 8 K, are accessible through this website. Access to these filings is free of charge. The reports are available as soon as practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC. Accounting Rule Changes The following accounting pronouncements have been approved by the Financial Accounting Standards Board but have not become effective as of December 31, 2006. These pronouncements would apply to the Company if the Company or the Bank entered into an applicable activity. FASB Statement No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets" amends FASB Statement No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. The Statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in each of several specific situations. It also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value, if practicable, and permits an entity to choose either of two accepted measurement methods for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. The Statement permits, at its initial adoption, a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights. Lastly, the Statement requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. Management does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 22 FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management does not expect SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. FASB Statement No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)"requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets. The effective date of the recognition and disclosure provisions for calendar year public companies is for calendar years ending after December 15, 2006. Management does not expect SFAS No. 158 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements since the Company does not currently have any defined benefit plans. FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Management does not expect FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies adopted by management are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and are consistent with those followed by peer Banks. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Impact of Inflation Unlike most industrial companies, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, interest rates have a more significant effect on the Companys performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices. In addition, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. As discussed previously, management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation. See "Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity" above.
