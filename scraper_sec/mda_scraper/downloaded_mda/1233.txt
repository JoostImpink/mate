ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Emeritus is a Washington corporation founded by Daniel R. Baty and two other long time associates in 1993. Mr. Baty is chairman of our board of directors, chief executive officer, and one of our largest shareholders. He is also a party to a number of agreements with us and is referred to frequently in discussions of the business. In November 1995, we completed our initial public offering. From 1995 through 1999, we expanded rapidly through acquisition and internal development and by December 31, 1999, operated 129 assisted living communities with 11,726 units. We believe, however, that during this expansion, the assisted living industry became over built, creating an environment characterized by sluggish or falling occupancy and market resistance to rate increases. As a result, in 2000 we began an increased focus first on raising our occupancy and later on rate development, operating efficiencies, and cost controls. This focus has continued throughout 2005 and 2006. We believe the operating environment of the assisted living industry has been improving over the past several years resulting in occupancy gains and increases in the average monthly rate. These operating improvements have also resulted in greater access to capital. We believe these dynamics have resulted in the consolidation of smaller local and regional operators into the larger national operators, and anticipate this consolidation of the industry will continue. Because of these circumstances, we have been able to complete several acquisitions or leases in the last few years, although at a slower pace in 2005 and 2006. Although opportunities for further expansion have been available over the past two years, we have been selective in our growth as we have seen a sharp increase in market prices. As a result, we have focused more on internal growth through expansion of existing properties and construction of new communities. We currently have expansion projects in eight of our communities and will continue to look at other expansion opportunities where the market conditions are favorable. In addition, we have several development projects in various stages of completion in several locations. Since the beginning of 2003, we have converted 60 of our managed properties to owned or leased, terminated management agreements on 25 communities, and entered into new management contracts on 22 communities, resulting in a decline of managed properties from 95 at the beginning of 2003 to 32 at the end of 2006. In addition, we have completed sale/leaseback transactions on 15 communities, acquired nine (one of which we formerly managed) and disposed of two properties, resulting in a decline of owned properties from 18 to 10 over the same period. Finally, we have converted 59 properties from managed to leased, acquired 21 new leased properties, converted 15 from owned to leased, and terminated one lease over that period, resulting in an increase of leased properties from 67 to 161. Those communities we own and lease, and which are included in our consolidated portfolio, increased from 85 at the beginning of 2003 to 171 at the end of 2006, reflecting both our increasing confidence in the assisted living industry and the availability of capital. In 2007, we expect to continue our focus on increasing occupancy and rates, as well as reviewing acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria. 36 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents The following table sets forth a summary of our property interests. As of December 31, As of December 31, As of December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Buildings Units Buildings Units Buildings Units Owned (1) 10 808 9 707 6 454 Leased (2 ) 161 12,821 161 12,805 158 12,589 Consolidated Portfolio 171 13,629 170 13,512 164 13,043 Managed/Admin Services (3) 11 1,232 13 1,443 16 1,668 Joint Venture/Partnership (4) 21 1,652 1 140 1 140 Operated Portfolio 203 16,513 184 15,095 181 14,851 Percentage increase (decrease) (5) 10.3% 9.4% 1.7% 1.6% 3.4% 0.0% (1) Owned communities increased since December 2004 due to the acquisition of three communities in Arkansas and one in Washington. (2) Of the leased communities at December 31, 2006, 77 are accounted for as operating leases, in which the assets and liabilities of the communities are not included in our consolidated balance sheet and 70 are accounted for as capital leases, in which a long term asset and corresponding liability is established on our balance sheet. The remaining 14 leased communities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as owned communities because of accounting requirements related to sale leaseback accounting, notwithstanding the legal sale of the communities and their subsequent leasing by us. (3) Since 2004, we have terminated management agreements on six communities and started management of one building in December 2006. (4) In December 2006, we began managing 20 communities from a joint venture in which we hold a 19% interest. (5) The percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year. Two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities. We rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future. Although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility, we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities. In this context, we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated. In evaluating the rate component, we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit, computed by dividing the total revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period. In evaluating the occupancy component, we generally rely on an average occupancy rate, computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period. We evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio, which includes the communities we own and lease, and our operating portfolio, which also includes the communities we manage. In our consolidated portfolio, our average monthly revenue per unit increased from $2,869 to $2,957 and to $3,100 in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The change from 2005 to 2006 represents an increase of $143, or 4.8% and from 2004 to 2005, an increase of $88, or 3.1%. This level of increase is partially due to repositioning several groups of our acquired communities over the past year to be more rate competitive and to establish a new presence in their respective markets. In addition, increased competition in certain locations has prevented us from raising rates to the extent we otherwise would have desired. In our consolidated portfolio, our average occupancy rate was 82.5% in 2004, increasing to 84.5% and 85.3% in 2005 and 2006, respectively. We believe that this increase in occupancy rates reflects industry wide factors, such as the declining supply of vacant units as well as our own actions and policies. We continue to 37 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community, as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit from 2003 through 2006. Since our inception in 1993, we have incurred operating losses totaling approximately $207.0 million as of December 31, 2006. We believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion, financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion, administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls, the impact in the early years on many of our leases from capital and financing lease treatments, and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated. While we have realized growth in both our occupancy and average monthly rates, we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as our occupancy stabilizes at levels of approximately 93%. Our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates, selective growth, and changes in our capital structure, such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing high rate debt. Significant Transactions From 2004 through 2006, and continuing into 2007, we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own, lease, and manage; our financing arrangements; and our capital structure. These transactions are summarized below. 2006 Blackstone Joint Venture We hold a 19.0% interest in a joint venture (Blackstone JV) that acquired 21 properties in December 2006, for a price of $165.5 million. Blackstone JV expects to acquire four additional properties for $24.5 million in the first half of 2007 after licensing and lender approvals are obtained. The portfolio consists of 24 assisted living and dementia care communities and one skilled nursing facility and includes 1,990 units. Blackstone JV obtained $167.0 million in available mortgage financing from GE Capital, of which $158.7 million is available to purchase properties and $8.3 million is reserved for capital improvements and interest funding. At the initial closing of 21 properties, the joint venture drew on $139.9 million of the financing commitment. The financing has a five year term, maturing in December 2011, and bears interest at London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.35%, adjusted monthly. For December 2006, the interest rate was 7.699%. Payments are interest only for the first two years, but this feature could extend for the five year term if certain performance benchmarks are achieved; otherwise, beginning in the third year, principal and interest payments are required based on excess cash flow. After the first year, the financing agreement contains a financial covenant requiring that the portfolio maintain annual net operating income, as defined, equal to at least 10% of the then outstanding mortgage balance. The total initial capital commitment of Blackstone JV partners is expected to be approximately $37.3 million, including the non financed portion of the purchase price, transaction costs and escrow reserve requirements of $5.0 million, and initial working capital of $1.0 million. Our expected initial contribution is $7.1 million, of which $6.2 million was paid in 2006. We formed Blackstone JV with Blackstone Real Property Group (Blackstone) in October 2006. We are the administrative member responsible for day to day operations. Blackstone holds the remaining 81.0% interest in Blackstone JV and has final authority with respect to all major decisions of the joint venture. The joint venture agreement provides that capital contributions and distributions are in proportion to percentage interests, but we are entitled to additional distributions if certain performance targets are met. We have a right of first opportunity if Blackstone JV sells all or any of the properties or Blackstone sells its joint venture interest. We are prohibited from selling our joint venture interest without Blackstones consent. Pursuant to 38 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents management agreements with Blackstone JV, we manage 20 of the properties for a fee equal to 5.0% of gross revenues collected. We account for our investment in Blackstone JV under the equity method of accounting and, after elimination of our related ownership interests, we recorded equity losses of approximately $104,000 and management fee income of approximately $166,000 for the month and year ended December 31, 2006. Alterra Transactions In October 2003, we formed a joint venture with Fortress Investment Group LLC, a New York based private equity fund, and NW Select LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Baty, with interests of 25%, 50% and 25%, respectively. Our investment in the joint venture was $7.7 million. The purpose of the joint venture was to acquire Alterra Healthcare Corporation, a national assisted living company headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Our interest in the joint venture, which initially was a limited liability company, was accounted for on the equity method and we recognized a loss of $794,000 in the first quarter of 2004 as our portion of Alterras net losses. Beginning February 1, 2004, the joint venture converted to a corporation and our interest was thereafter accounted for as an investment on the cost basis. In June 2005, we sold 50% of our interests in the joint venture to Fortress for $25 million. In November 2005, we sold our remaining interest in the joint venture through a public offering of common stock of Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., which had acquired the joint venture. As a result of these transactions, we received approximately $62.3 million in net proceeds and recognized gains of approximately $55.4 million in 2005. We have no further interest in Brookdale. Emeritrust Transactions In September 2004, we completed the lease of 18 of 20 communities, with the remaining two communities leased in 2005. These communities, which were owned by entities in which Mr. Baty had financial interests, were acquired by a real estate investment trust (REIT) and leased to us. The lease provides for a 15 year term, with one 15 year renewal option. The initial lease payment was approximately $14.7 million per year, with annual lease inflators based on the change in the consumer price, not to exceed an annual ceiling. We have the right of first refusal to purchase these leased communities. Of the 20 communities, 16 had been a part of the Emeritrust communities that we had managed since 1998, originally consisting of 25 communities but declining to 21 by 2004. We currently manage three communities from the original group. For 2004 and thereafter, our management agreement provided for management fees of 5% of gross revenues, which resulted in management fee revenue of $473,000, $516,000 and $1.9 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Mr. Baty personally guarantees our obligations under the lease. Pursuant to a cash flow sharing agreement with us, he receives 50% of the positive cash flow of the 20 communities, as defined in the agreement, and is responsible for 50% of the negative cash flow. Under this arrangement, Mr. Baty received $164,000 for the fourth quarter of 2004 and $632,000 for 2005. In 2006, he paid us $317,000 as a result of capital expenditures related to the communities. As a part of a 2003 transaction in which we leased a separate group of Emeritrust communities that we had managed from 1999, we issued seven year warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.60 per share to the owners of the communities, which included Mr. Baty. Warrants to purchase 400,000 shares were exercised in February 2006 and we received proceeds of $3.0 million. In March 2006, warrants to purchase 100,000 shares were exercised pursuant to a net exercise provision in which we issued 69,169 shares to the holders and 30,831 shares were used to pay the exercise price of $760,000, based on a price of $24.65 per share. 39 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents April 2004 Lease Transaction In April 2004, we completed the lease of 17 of a group of 23 communities, including nine stand alone dementia care facilities, with four of the remaining six communities leased later in 2004 and the final two communities leased in 2005. Of the communities, 13 were formerly owned by entities in which Mr. Baty had financial interests; of which 12 of these communities had been managed by us prior to the lease. The nine stand alone dementia care facilities were formerly owned by entities controlled by JEA Senior Living, an independent third party, although Mr. Baty had non controlling financial interests in the entities. The communities were acquired by a REIT and leased to us under a 15 year lease, with three five year renewal options. The initial lease payment was approximately $16.1 million per year, with annual lease inflators based on the change in the consumer price, not to exceed an annual ceiling. This transaction also provided for an earn out arrangement for payment to the JEA entities of up to $2.0 million based on improvements in the net operating income of the dementia care facilities during the three years following closing. We also entered into a three year agreement for JEA to manage the nine dementia care facilities. The agreement provided for a management fee of 5% of revenues and a termination fee of $100,000 per year for the 10 years following termination of the agreement. In September 2006, we entered into an agreement for the early termination of the management agreement and the earn out arrangement. The management agreement was terminated September 30, 2006, six months early. In lieu of the 10 year termination fee, we paid JEA a lump sum of $594,000. Based on performance of the communities, we paid the full $2.0 million earn out payment in September 2006, also six months early. We had accrued $444,000 of the termination fee through September 2006 and accrued an additional $150,000 in the third quarter of 2006 as a result of the early termination payment. 2005 2006 Community Acquisitions In December 2005, we purchased three communities located in Arkansas, with a capacity of 253 units, for a price of $17.8 million. We financed $15.9 million of the purchase price with GE Capital mortgage financing that matures in December 2012, with no prepayment right, bears interest at 6.95% per annum and provides for monthly payments based on a 25 year amortization. In July 2006, we purchased a 101 unit community we formerly managed for $11.0 million from an entity in which Mr. Baty had a 50% financial interest. We financed $8.0 million of the purchase price with GE Capital mortgage financing that matures in June 2013, with no prepayment right, bears interest at 7.229% per annum, and provides for monthly payments based on a 25 year amortization. The GE Capital mortgage loans are cross collateralized. Senior Med Transaction In 2000, we purchased a 30% interest in Senior Healthcare Partners LLC for approximately $2.2 million. Senior Healthcare provides pharmacy services to senior housing resident under the trade name Senior Med. Through the subsequent issuance of a 5.0% equity share to a key Senior Healthcare employee, our equity interest was reduced to 28.5%. In September 2005, Senior Healthcare sold two thirds of its business to Walgreen Company for cash and assumption of liabilities. Under the agreement Walgreen has an option to purchase the remaining one third of the business at a fixed price through May 2007, and thereafter, beginning in September 2008, Senior Healthcare has a put and Walgreen has a call at a price based on a multiple of revenue, as defined in the 40 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents agreement. The agreement also includes a non competition agreement, which prevents us from providing pharmacy services to the assisted living industry in the U.S. for 18 months after we cease to hold any interest in the business of Senior Healthcare. As a result of the transaction, we continue to hold a 9.5% indirect interest in the Senior Med business. We account for our interest in Senior Healthcare using the equity method of accounting. In 2006, we made $380,000 in additional contributions and recognized equity losses of $713,000. In 2005, we received cash distributions of $2.3 million and recognized equity earnings of $2.4 million from the Walgreen transaction. In 2004, we recognized equity earnings of $132,000. Sale of Land and Communities In August 2004, we sold undeveloped land located in Grand Terrace, California, for cash of approximately $518,000 and recorded a gain, net of closing costs, of $265,000. In December 2005, we sold an undeveloped parcel of land located in Pima County, Arizona, for cash of $524,000 and recorded a gain, net of closing costs of $88,000. As further described under the caption Discontinued Operations, we recorded a gain of $1.3 million in January 2005 related to the sale of a community located in Issaquah, Washington. In December 2005, we sold a community in Las Vegas, Nevada, and recorded a loss of approximately $4.3 million. Both of these communities are included in discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock In June 2005, we entered into an agreement with Saratoga Partners IV, LP. and its affiliates, the holder of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Stock), that provided for the conversion of the Series B Stock upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid cash dividends in the amount of $10.8 million. We borrowed $10.8 million from a REIT at 10% per annum for a term of three years in order to pay the accumulated cash dividends of the Series B Stock, resulting in an increase in interest expense of approximately $1.1 million and $536,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Upon the payment of the dividends on June 30, 2005, Saratoga converted all of the outstanding Series B Stock into 5,365,746 shares of common stock. Preferred stock dividends of $957,000 were recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2005, consisting of cash dividends of $591,000 and in kind dividends of $366,000. For accounting purposes, we had accrued a dividend payable liability of $11.1 million, which included approximately $358,000 that represented a straight line dividend accrual that was reversed upon closing of this stock transaction in the second quarter of 2005. As part of the agreement, no dividends were required to be paid for the second quarter of 2005. Thus, the preferred dividends for the year ended December 31, 2005, amounted to $599,000. We had also issued to Saratoga seven year warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $4.30 per share in August 2000, which was subsequently adjusted to $4.20 per share due to dilutive stock option transactions, as provided in the warrant agreement. In March 2006, we issued 829,597 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. The shares were purchased by the holders of the warrants pursuant to a "net exercise" provision of the warrants in which 170,403 shares subject to the warrants were used to pay the exercise price of $4.2 million. The shares used to pay the exercise price were valued at $24.65 per share based on current market prices, as determined under the terms of the warrants. We received no cash proceeds from this transaction. 41 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Convertible Debentures In November 2005, we completed an offer to exchange our outstanding 6.25% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2006 for new 6.25% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2008. In the exchange offer, $26.6 million of the $32.0 million principal amount of outstanding debentures were exchanged. The remaining $5.4 million principal amount of outstanding debentures continued outstanding and was paid at maturity in January 2006. The terms of the existing debentures and the new debentures were substantially the same, except that the maturity of the new debentures was July 1, 2008, instead of January 1, 2006, and the new debentures could not be redeemed at our election. The new debentures are convertible into common stock at the rate of $22 per share, which equates to 1,207,955 shares of common stock after the issuance of 2,272 shares upon conversion of $50,000 of the debentures in February 2006. Interest on the new debentures is payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The new debentures are unsecured, and subordinated to all our other indebtedness. Of the $26.6 million of debentures, $20.8 million are owned by directors and officers or their affiliates. Saratoga, two of whose representatives are directors, owns $5.0 million of the debentures. Affiliates (Baty Entities) of Mr. Baty and Stanley L. Baty, a director, own $15.8 million of the debentures. Together the Baty Entities and Saratoga beneficially own approximately 78.2% of the debentures. As further explained under Subsequent Events Debenture Conversion, effective March 8, 2007, holders of $16.1 million of outstanding debentures elected to convert their holdings into 732,726 shares of common stock. Of the debentures converted, $15.8 million was held by entities controlled by Mr. Baty. The entities controlled by Mr. Baty no longer hold any debentures. We will pay an incentive fee of $1.5 million in connection with this conversion, which amount would have been paid in three equal installments on July 1, 2007, January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008, if the debentures were held to maturity. The incentive payment will be expensed in the first quarter of 2007.

Due to certain legal requirements of resident notification, we leased the property back from the third party through August 31, 2004. In addition, in September 2004, we committed to sell another community located in Issaquah, Washington, which under SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, qualified as an asset held for sale. A current asset of $7.9 million was recorded on our financial statements and we discontinued depreciating the assets as of September 30, 2004. The Issaquah community was sold on November 1, 2004. Since we had a continuing involvement in the community until such time as the buyer was granted an operating license in January 2005, we deferred the gain of $1.3 million until that point. In December 2005, we sold a community in Las Vegas, Nevada, and recorded an impairment loss of $4.3 million. Both the impairment loss and the gain on sale are recorded in discontinued operations for 2005. All three transactions qualify for discontinued operations treatment under SFAS No. 144 and the results of discontinued operations is reported as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations. Approximately $1.1 million of tax benefit was recorded to discontinued operations in 2005. The following table shows the revenues and net income (loss) for the discontinued operations (in thousands): Three Months ended Twelve Months ended December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 Total revenue: Issaquah $ $ $ $ Scottsdale Las Vegas 312 1,361 Total $ $ 312 $ $ 1,361 Net income (loss): Issaquah $ $ $ 1 $ 1,319 Scottsdale (19 ) 3 Las Vegas (80 ) (32 ) (4,650 ) Federal and state income tax benefit of discontinued operations 1,131 1,131 Total $ $ 1,051 $ (50 ) $ (2,197 ) Subsequent Events 2007 Debenture Conversion In February 2007, we offered to pay a cash incentive to debenture holders if they elected to convert their debentures into common stock by giving written notice on or before March 8, 2007. The incentive payment will be equal to the amount of interest that the holders would have received if the debentures were held to the maturity date of July 1, 2008. The payment will be made on April 16, 2007. The debentures are convertible into common stock at $22.00 per share. Of the $26.6 million principal amount of debentures outstanding, holders of $16.1 million principal amount converted their debentures into 732,726 shares of common stock. Of the debentures converted into common stock, $15.8 million was held by entities controlled by Mr. Baty. We will pay an incentive fee of $1.5 million in connection with this conversion, which amount would have been paid in three equal installments on July 1, 2007, January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008, if the debentures were held to maturity. The incentive payment will be charged to expense in the first 44 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents quarter of 2007. As provided in SFAS No. 84 (As Amended) Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt, when convertible debt is converted into equity securities pursuant to an inducement offer, any payment of cash or other consideration to those debt holders who convert during a specified time should be recognized as an expense of the period. 2007 Fretus Communities Purchased On February 22, 2007, we purchased 24 communities consisting of 1,651 units located in six states for a price of $145.1 million, including transaction costs. We had leased these communities from Fretus Investors LLC since October 2002. Capmark Finance, Inc. provided fixed rate mortgage financing of $132.0 million and variable rate mortgage financing of $8.0 million. The fixed rate component has a term of five years and bears interest at 6.55% per annum (with a 1% exit fee payable if the debt is paid off or refinanced by anyone except Capmark), with monthly interest only payments for two years and thereafter, monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 25 year amortization. The remaining balance is due in full in February 2012. The variable rate component has a term of three years and interest at 30 day LIBOR plus 1.8%, which was 7.12% at closing, and the same exit fee and payment schedule as for the fixed component. Fretus was a private investment joint venture between Fremont Realty Capital, which held a 65% interest, and a Baty related entity, which held a 35% minority interest. Mr. Baty held a 16% indirect interest in the minority entity, personally guaranteed $3.0 million of the Fretus mortgage debt covering the communities and the Baty related entity was the administrative member of Fretus. In conjunction with this transaction, the Baty related entity provided $18.0 million in short term financing to us, of which approximately $5.1 million was used to fund the balance of the purchase price and the balance is available for general business purposes. The unsecured short term debt is due in February 2009 and bears interest at 9.0% per annum. 2007 HRT Communities Purchase On March 15, 2007, we purchased 12 communities consisting of 786 units located in five states for a price of $99.0 million, plus transaction costs. We had leased four of these communities from Healthcare Realty Trust since May 2002 and eight since May 2003. Capmark Finance, Inc. provided fixed rate senior mortgage financing of $88.0 million at 6.515% per annum and second mortgage financing of $13.6 million at a variable rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus 325 basis points, rounded up to the nearest .125%, which equaled 8.625% per annum at the closing date. The senior mortgage has a term of five years (with 1% exit fee if the debt is paid off or refinanced by anyone except Capmark) and monthly interest only payments for three years and, thereafter, monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 25 year amortization. The remaining balance is due in full in April 2012. The second mortgage has a term of two years with monthly interest only payments and is due in full in April 2009. The second mortgage has a 1% exit fee if paid off prior to the first anniversary date or a 2% exit fee is paid off after the first anniversary date, unless it is refinanced with Capmark. The total Capmark loan commitment of $101.6 million will be used to pay the purchase price, transaction and financing costs, and retirement of a $600,000 loan, as described below. We currently have approximately $32.8 million in loans outstanding with Healthcare Realty Trust, of which $11.4 million is secured by the leases on the 12 communities described above. Of the $11.4 million, $10.8 relates to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock transaction in which Healthcare Realty Trust loaned such amount to pay the accumulated dividends due upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. As part of this transaction, the $10.8 million loan was acquired by Mr. Baty on similar terms and conditions as the original loan, and the remaining $600,000 was paid off at closing. 45 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents The following unaudited pro forma summary, reflects the unaudited balance sheet impact of the subsequent events described above as if they had happened on December 31, 2006 (In thousands): As Reported Pro Forma December 31, Debenture Fretus HRT December 31, ASSETS 2006 Conversion Acquisition Acquisition 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,049 $ (1,511 ) $ 12,696 $ (393 ) $ 24,841 Other current assets 37,122 87 339 37,548 Property and equipment, net 600,693 143,625 79,128 823,446 Lease and contract acquisition costs, net 25,762 (302 ) (424 ) 25,036 Restricted deposits 12,601 12,601 Other long term assets 12,833 855 867 14,555 Total assets $ 703,060 $ (1,511 ) $ 156,961 $ 79,517 $ 938,027 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT Current liabilities $ 93,048 $ $ (737 ) $ (47 ) $ 92,264 Long term debt, less current portion 83,597 158,000 101,000 342,597 Capital lease and financing obligations, less current portion 585,912 (21,012 ) 564,900 Convertible debentures, less current portion 26,575 (16,120 ) 10,455 Other long term liabilities 32,960 32,960 Total liabilities 822,092 (16,120 ) 157,263 79,941 1,043,176 Total Stockholders deficit (119,032 ) 14,609 (302 ) (424 ) (105,149 ) Total liabilities and stockholders deficit $ 703,060 $ (1,511 ) $ 156,961 $ 79,517 $ 938,027 Results of Operations Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to resident programs and incentives such as move in fees, bad debts, investments, intangible assets, impairment of long lived assets, income taxes, restructuring, long term service contracts, contingencies, self insured retention, health insurance, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 46 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents We believe the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. We are self insured for professional liability claims and accrue losses based upon actuarial estimates of the total aggregate liability for claims within the current year, plus related administrative expenses. We make periodic adjustments to our total liability for all open years from 2002 through 2006 if actuarial estimates suggest our exposure has changed. Losses are covered through a self insurance pool agreement, which includes 11 of our 32 managed communities on a unit of capacity basis. Should losses exceed the actuarial estimates, additional expense may be accrued at the time of such determination. We deposit funds with an administrator based in part on a fixed schedule and in part as losses are actually paid. The funds held by the administrator are recorded as a prepaid asset. The prepaid asset is reduced as claims are paid from the account. During 2005, we acquired separate general liability commercial coverage that continues to be in place throughout 2006. For health insurance, we self insure each covered member up to a certain level above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs for certain covered members. Health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred. If these estimates are insufficient, additional charges may be required. Workers compensation insurance coverage applies for specific insurable states (excluding Texas, New York (for a part of 2005), Washington, Ohio, and West Virginia) through a high deductible, collateralized insurance policy. The policy premium is based upon standard rates applied to estimated annual payroll. We contract with an independent third party administrator to administer the claims; and claim expenses are paid from the collateral account. The sum of the premium and related costs, estimated administration costs, and actuarial based estimated losses is accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll. The cash collateral paid under the plan is carried as a prepaid asset on the balance sheet and is reduced as claims are paid from the account by the administrator. At policy expiration each year, an insurer audit is conducted to adjust premiums based on actual, rather than estimated, annual payroll. The insurer also audits the total incurred claim amount at least annually and may adjust the applicable policy year collateral requirement. If there is a reasonable expectation that the total incurred losses will be less than the posted collateral, then the excess cash collateral will be returned to the Company. For part of 2005, we insured occupational injuries and illness in New York through participation in a self insured group pool on a guaranteed cost insurance policy basis, with the premium payable monthly. The insurer group contracts with an independent third party administrator on behalf of its members to manage the claims, and claim expenses are paid by the insurer. During 2005, New York was added to our collateralized insurance policy discussed above. For work related injuries in Texas, we provide work related injury benefits through a qualified state sponsored plan. Claim expenses are paid as incurred and estimated losses are accrued on a monthly basis based on actual payroll. An insurance policy is in place to cover liability losses in excess of a deductible amount. We contract with an independent third party administrator to manage the claims. The cost of this insurance is accrued monthly. We also contract with an independent third party to certify the actuarial estimate of ultimate losses for workers compensation under the collateralized policy. Claims and expenses incurred under the collateralized policy are shared among the participants through a self insurance pooling agreement which includes the managed communities, unless such community is located in the specific states mentioned above. Costs are allocated to each participant based on annual payroll. 47 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents As of January 1, 2006, we account for stock option awards to employees using a modified prospective application, as permitted under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), a revision of SFAS No. 123, as amended, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123R establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for, generally, all share based payment transactions with employees. The fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates, stock price volatility, dividend yield, and weighted average option life. Under this application, we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. Before the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we applied APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees to account for stock based awards. Under this method, no compensation expense was recorded provided the exercise price was equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our residents to make required payments. If the financial condition of our residents were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. However, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made. Primarily due to the gain on sale of our investment in Alterra, we utilized most of our available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards in 2005. We account for impairment of long lived assets, which include property and equipment, long term investments, and amortizable intangible assets, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as applicable. An impairment review is performed quarterly or whenever a change in condition occurs, which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable. Such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual communities. We use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. Such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. The computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. Any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value. We account for leases as operating, capital, or financing leases depending on the underlying terms. The determination of the classification of leases is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment. Leases are generally accounted for as operating leases to the extent the underlying lease does not: (i) transfer ownership by the end of the lease term, (ii) contain a bargain purchase option, (iii) include a lease term equal to or greater than 75% of the economic life of the leased property, or (iv) include minimum lease payments for which the present value equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying leased property. Those leases that meet one of the 48 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents criteria described above cannot be accounted for as operating leases but are accounted for as capital leases. For properties under capital lease arrangements, an asset is established on the balance sheet based on the present value of the rent payments not to exceed the fair value of the underlying leased property, including base rent, fixed annual increases and any other payment obligations over the lease term, and a corresponding long term liability is recorded. Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the lease obligation and the capital lease asset is depreciated over the term of the lease. Typically, capital lease treatment results in greater depreciation and interest than actual lease payments paid in the early years of the leases and less depreciation and interest than actual rent paid in the later years of the leases. Properties that are sold and leased back and for which we have continuing involvement are accounted for as financing arrangements, in which the property remains on the balance sheet and a financing obligation is recorded generally equal to the purchase price of the properties sold. The impact on the statement of operations is similar to a capital lease. Properties under operating leases are not included on the balance sheet and are accounted for in the statement of operations as facility lease expense for actual rent paid to the extent any increases in rent is considered to be contingent and not determinable. In cases where there are rent escalator provisions that have fixed or determinable increases, the operating leases are accounted for as the total rent for the term of the lease, including both base rent and fixed annual increases, on a straight line basis over the lease term. This accounting treatment results in greater facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the earlier years of the respective leases and less facility lease expense than the actual rent paid in the later years of the lease. Our accounting policy regarding contingent liabilities is to recognize obligations if they are probable and estimable in accordance with SFAS 5 Accounting for Contingencies based on managements best estimate of the ultimate outcome. If a legal judgment is rendered against us or a settlement offer has been tendered, then we believe that we have a probable liability and we accrue the full amount of the judgment or settlement offer. Our long term investments consist of investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from 19.0% to 28.5%. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. In determining the accounting treatment for these investments, we consider various factors such as our ownership interest, our ability to influence decisions, our participating rights, and whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity, and if so, if we are the primary beneficiary. We review the recoverability of our investments at least quarterly, or whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. 49 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Statements of Operations as Percentage of Revenues and Year over Year Percentage Change The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change of the dollar amounts from year over year: Year to Year Percentage of Revenues Percentage Change Years Ended December 31, Fav / (Unfav) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2005 2004 Revenues: 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 8.8 % 22.4 % Expenses: Community operations* 64.7 66.3 63.3 (6.1 ) (28.1 ) Texas lawsuit accrual (settlement) (2.9 ) 5.9 N/A N/A General and administrative 9.0 8.0 8.3 (23.5 ) (17.4 ) Depreciation and amortization 12.0 11.9 10.3 (9.1 ) (42.4 ) Facility lease expense 10.6 10.7 12.1 (7.4 ) (8.0 ) Total operating expenses 93.4 96.9 99.9 (4.8 ) (18.7 ) Operating income from continuing operations 6.6 3.1 0.1 133.3 N/M Other income (expense) Interest income 0.7 0.4 0.2 92.0 153.3 Interest expense (11.7 ) (12.9 ) (13.3 ) 1.8 (18.8 ) Gain on sale of investment in Alterra Healthcare Corporation 14.3 N/A N/A Equity earnings (losses) in unconsolidated joint ventures (0.2 ) 0.6 (0.2 ) N/A N/A Other, net 0.4 0.7 0.7 (43.5 ) 19.1 Net other income (expense) (10.8 ) 3.1 (12.6 ) N/A 129.4 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (4.2 ) 6.2 (12.5 ) N/A 160.1 Benefit of (provision for) income taxes 0.7 (2.4 ) (0.4 ) 132.5 N/A Income (loss) from continuing operations (3.5 ) 3.8 (12.9 ) N/A 135.4 Income (loss) from discontinued operations (0.6 ) 0.1 (97.7 ) N/A Net income (loss) (3.5 %) 3.2 % (12.8 %) N/A 130.3 % * exclusive of depreciation and amortization and facility lease expense shown separately below [The rest of this page is intentionally left blank] 50 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Total Operating Revenues: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ D % D (in thousands) Community revenue $ 413,564 $ 378,906 $ 34,658 9.1 % Other service fees 6,414 6,845 (431 ) (6.3 %) Total community revenues 419,978 385,751 34,227 8.9 % Management fees 1,887 1,981 (94 ) (4.7 %) Total operating revenues $ 421,865 $ 387,732 $ 34,133 8.8 % This increase in total community revenues of $34.2 million is partially due to additional revenues related to the acquisition or lease of eight communities from January 1, 2005, to the end of 2006. These additional communities represent an increase in revenue of approximately $11.0 million for 2006. The remaining increase of $23.2 million, or 6.0%, is primarily due to an increase in the average revenue per unit, which accounted for $20.8 million of the increase, and an increase in occupancy rate, which accounted for $2.4 million of the increase.

The increase in revenue per unit was primarily attributable to rate increases in the previously existing communities and higher occupancy in our higher rate memory loss units. Management fees decreased by $94,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the net reduction in management agreements during the year, excluding the 21 management agreements added in December 2006.

Significant factors impacting the change in community operating expense between the periods were adjustments to our professional and general liability insurance accrual. We recorded an additional $5.0 million professional and general liability insurance accrual in 2005, to reflect the settlement experience of claims closed during the year, primarily from claims originating in 2003 and 2004, and to reflect an updated estimate of ultimate losses for all years from 2002 to 2005, based upon an actuarial valuation report. However, in 2006, considering the updated settlement claims history, we reduced our professional and general liability insurance accrual by $1.7 million, based upon an updated actuarial valuation report. Thus, the impact on the change from year to year of these two adjustments was an expense reduction of $6.7 million. Another factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was a reduction in workers compensation expense of $1.3 million due to revised estimates of our ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs and claims paid history. The adjustment was based upon an actuarial valuation report. An additional factor impacting the change in community operating expenses between the periods was an accrual of $1.9 million recorded in 2006 related to the Texas Medicaid settlement discussed under Legal Proceedings. Aside from the items noted above, community operations expense increased $21.8 million, or 8.5%. Approximately $6.4 million of this increase was from the addition of eight new communities. Of the remaining increase of $15.4 million in community operations expense, approximately $10.8 million was increased staffing costs and approximately $2.6 million was due to increases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses. The remaining difference was due to increases of $2.0 million in various other operating costs, primarily marketing, food costs, bad debts, supplies, telephone and cable service, partially offset by net decreases in various smaller items.

The rest of the increase was primarily due to increases in legal fees of $1.3 million for the Texas Medicaid settlement, and increases in accounting and consulting fees of $449,000, primarily related to additional audit work for compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. 52 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 $ D % D (in thousands) Depreciation and amortization $ 50,478 $ 46,277 $ 4,201 9.1 % As a percent of revenue 12.0 % 11.9 % .1 ppt Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased $4.2 million partially as the result of depreciation of $2.0 million arising from the purchase of four additional communities and capital lease treatment associated with the leasing of two additional communities since January 2005, and the balance of the increase from additional depreciation on capital expenditures to improve our properties.

Interest expense increased by $640,000 after adjusting for the settlement impact noted above. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $1.1 million relating to debt financing associated with three new Arkansas communities acquired in December 2005, $118,000 relating to two new communities under capital leases acquired in March 2005, $536,000 from the new $10.8 million loan we entered into in connection with our Series B Stock conversion in June 2005, $313,000 related to the acquisition of Arbor Place in July 2006, offset by a decline in interest expense from the pay down of principal balances over the past year.

The remaining $1.2 million of tax benefit from the expected carry back is related to employee exercises of stock options and was recorded to additional paid in capital. In addition, the income tax benefit for 2006 includes an adjustment related to the finalization of our 2005 tax return. Other than the loss carry back benefit discussed above, no benefit has been recognized for the Companys net deferred tax assets as management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005, is due to federal and state income and franchise tax liabilities on operating income primarily due to differences between tax and financial accounting treatment for capital and financing and straight line lease expense and from gains on sale of our Alterra and Senior Med investments. Net Income (Loss) and Property Related Expense: In comparing the net income for 2006 to the net loss for 2005, management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses, which includes depreciation and amortization, facility lease expense, and interest expense that is directly related to our communities. The property related expenses directly associated with our accounting for leases, which includes operating leases, capital leases, financing leases, and straight line accounting for rent escalators for many of our operating leases, is presented in the table below. These lease accounting treatments generally result in greater property related expense than actual lease payments made in the early years of the affected leases and less property related expense than actual lease payments made in later years.

Our property related expense for 2005 was $137.9 million, of which $122.2 million was associated with our leases. Our actual capital and operating lease payments for this period were $98.6 million. Approximately $4.7 million of the increase of $6.4 million in total property related expense is due primarily to the acquisition and lease of eight additional communities since January 1, 2005, and the balance from depreciation on additional capital expenditures to improve our existing properties, lease inflator provisions in our existing leases and interest expense reductions from the net pay down of long term debt. The amount by which the property related expense associated with our leases exceeded our actual lease payments was $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $2.9 million. While the impact of lease accounting declined by $2.9 million in the current year from last year due to the normal reversal of the timing differences, the total impact in both periods is significant to our overall operating results. It should be noted that, notwithstanding the effects of lease accounting treatment, the actual lease payments required under most of our leases will continue to increase annually and, as a result, we will need to improve our results from community operations to cover these increases.

Of the 45 communities, we had formerly managed 30. These additional communities represent an increase in revenue of approximately $61.6 million for 2005. The remaining increase of $12.0 million, or 3.8%, is primarily due to an increase in occupancy rate ($5.8 million) and average revenue per unit ($7.0 million), offset by hurricane related revenue losses of approximately $750,000 primarily from the temporary closure of our Biloxi community.

The increase in revenue per unit was primarily attributable to rate increases in the previously existing communities and higher occupancy in our higher rate memory loss units, augmented by the acquisition or leasing of additional communities with higher revenues per unit than in existing communities. Management fees decreased by $2.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the termination of management agreements related to 33 communities, 30 of which we now lease.

This was primarily due to the acquisition or lease of 45 communities referred to above, which accounted for approximately $38.6 million of the increase. The balance of the increase of $12.3 million is associated with the previously existing communities and was primarily related to increases in personnel costs of $6.9 million, utilities of $1.3 million, and repairs and 58 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents maintenance of $1.3 million.

The expense for 2004 included $18.7 million related to the adverse judgment against us as described under "Legal Proceedings" and shown as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations. The expense for 2005 included a $5.0 million increase related to settlement experience of claims originating in 2003 and 2004 and other general increases of approximately $445,000. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma caused physical damage to several of our communities located in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Most of the losses were within our insurance deductibles and we incurred the cost to repair the damage. Our Biloxi, Mississippi, community sustained significant damage and was out of operation for approximately nine months. In addition, we incurred costs associated with evacuations and relocation of residents, as well as other uninsured costs. As a result of the hurricanes, we realized losses of approximately $1.0 million in 2005, an increase of $663,000 from similar losses of approximately $323,000 in 2004. Community operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenue decreased to 66.3% in 2005 from 69.2% in 2004, primarily as a result of the additional insurance costs in 2004. Excluding the reserves and accruals related to the litigation referred to above, community operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenue would have been 63.3% in 2004.

We experienced increases of approximately $2.4 million in personnel costs, which represented both added personnel and compensation increases. The rest of the increase was primarily due to increases in professional consulting and accounting fees related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related securities laws and increased oversight of our risk management programs. 59 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ D % D (in thousands) Depreciation and amortization $ 46,277 $ 32,492 $ 13,785 42.4 % As a percent of revenue 11.9 % 10.3 % 1.6 ppt Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased $13.8 million primarily as the result of depreciation arising from capital lease treatment associated with the leasing of 40 additional communities since January 1, 2004.

The balance of the increase is attributable to lease terms that provide for periodic increases in rent based on contingent factors such as cost indices or revenue volumes. We leased 77 communities under operating leases as of December 31, 2005, compared to 75 communities as of December 31, 2004.

The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2004, was principally due to a sale leaseback of properties occurring in July 2004 that generated approximately $32.0 million of taxable gain. This gain and other taxable income create 2005 Federal regular tax and 2004 Federal alternative minimum tax and state income and franchise tax liabilities of approximately $9.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Net Income (Loss) and Property Related Expense: In comparing the net income for 2005 to the net loss for 2004, management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses, which includes depreciation and amortization, facility lease expense, and interest expense that is directly related to our communities. The property related expenses directly associated with our accounting for leases, which includes operating leases, capital leases, financing leases, and straight line accounting for rent escalators for many of our operating leases, is presented in the table below. These lease accounting treatments all result in greater property related expense than actual lease payments made in the early years of the affected leases and less property related expense than actual lease payments made in later years.

Our actual capital and operating lease payments for this period were $75.2 million. The increase of $24.8 million in total property related expense is due primarily to the acquisition and lease of 45 additional communities since January 1, 2004. The amount by which the property related expense associated with our leases exceeded our actual lease payments was $23.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $6.8 million. This increase is primarily attributable to capital lease accounting treatment of leases for 40 of the 45 communities referred to above. It should be remembered that, notwithstanding the effects of lease accounting treatment, the actual lease payments required under most of our leases will continue to increase annually and, as a result, we will need to increase our revenues and our results from community operations to cover these increases.

Same community revenues increased by $7.7 million or 8.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, from the comparable period in 2005. This was primarily due to the increase in the average monthly revenue per unit and accounted for an increase of $4.5 million, augmented by an increase in average occupancy, which accounted for an increase of approximately $3.2 million.

Expense increases consisted of salaries and personnel costs of $1.3 million, bad debts of $226,000, repairs and maintenance of $210,000, and marketing, vehicle expense, food costs, and contracted services totaling $716,000. Expense decreases consisted of utilities of $210,000 due to unusual seasonal temperatures, property taxes of $652,000, and management fees of $267,000 resulting from termination of a third party management agreement in September 2006. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 million as a result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures to improve our properties. Facility lease expense increased $514,000 due to rent escalation provisions in some of our leases based on contingent factors such as cost indices or revenue 64 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents volumes. Interest expense decreased by $370,000 primarily due to the general pay down on the principal of existing debt. For the fourth quarter of 2006, our operating income after interest expense improved to income of $4.5 million from a loss of $800,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005. As discussed above, the improvement resulted from increased revenue and limited expense increases, partially offset by net property related expense increases.

We recorded this additional accrual to reflect the settlement experience of claims closed in the third quarter of 2005, primarily from claims originating in 2003 and 2004, and to reflect an updated estimate of ultimate losses for all years from 2002 to 2005, based upon an actuarial valuation report. Another major factor impacting the change in community operating expense between the periods was a reduction in workers compensation expense of approximately $1.9 million and $677,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, for a net change of $1.2 million due to revised estimates of our ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs based upon an actuarial valuation report. Exclusive of the general and professional liability insurance and workers compensation adjustments mentioned above, community operating expenses would have increased approximately $16.2 million primarily from increased costs for direct care labor and related employee taxes and benefits of $10.6 million. The increase also reflects increased utilities and facility repair and maintenance expenses of $2.7 million. The remaining increase of approximately $2.9 million is primarily comprised of other general operating expenses of the communities, including marketing, food costs, bad debts, supplies, vehicle expenses, telephone, cable TV, legal, dues, and similar community operating expenses. Property related expenses (depreciation and amortization, facility lease expense, and interest expense, net of interest income) increased by approximately $2.7 million, which primarily reflects the effect of lease terms that provide for periodic increases in rent based on contingent factors such as cost indices or revenue volumes and an increase in depreciation from increased capital expenditures to improve our properties, offset by an increase in interest income on restricted deposits, and a decrease in interest expense due to the pay down of principal balances. Operating income (loss) after interest expense increased from a loss of $1.6 million to income of $7.9 million for a total improvement of $9.5 million from the comparable period of 2005 as a result of the changes discussed above. Exclusive of the general and professional liability insurance and workers compensation adjustments noted above, the improvement in operating results would be approximately $3.7 million. We will continue our efforts to build our occupancy through increased marketing initiatives, programs that address resident mix and a focus on property improvements and other community level enhancements to attract additional long term residents and increase occupancy while maintaining growth in average monthly revenue per unit. We believe that these initiatives will continue to have a positive impact on operating performance over time.

The significant components of changes in operating assets and liabilities for each year is primarily comprised of the following: Significant components of changes in operating assets and liabilities: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Texas settlement accrued in 2004 and settled in 2006 $ (12,207 ) * $ $ 18,680 Payment of Texas settlement (5,600 ) * Refund (payment) of Texas settlement court bond 1,725 * (1,725 ) Prior year PL/GL accrual adjustments (1,700 ) 5,008 2,773 PL/GL claim payments (greater than) less than accrual 550 (1,192 ) 2,943 Net change in PL/GL liability accrual (17,232 ) 2,091 24,396 Texas settlement interest accrual (reversal) (766 ) * 766 Federal tax accrual (payment) on Alterra transaction gain (4,200 ) 4,200 Net change in workers compensation liability (2,750 ) (1,356 ) 1,513 Federal tax refund receivable from 2006 loss carryback (3,186 ) Refund of escrow and collateral cash accounts 2,069 1,664 All other activity, net (1,358 ) 1,153 582 Net change in operating assets and liabilities $ (29,492 ) $ 8,923 $ 28,155 Note: "PL/GL" refers to professional and general liability insurance. The Texas settlement impact of $16.8* million, the federal tax deposits of $4.2 million related to the Alterra transaction gain, and the federal tax refunds of $3.2 million, a total of $24.2 million for 2006, are expected to be non recurring items. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and was comprised primarily of acquisition of property and equipment of $23.7 million, construction expenditures on leased properties of $3.8 million, investments in affiliates of $6.9 million, and management and lease acquisition costs of $2.8 million. 67 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and was comprised primarily of proceeds from sale of our investment in Alterra of $62.3 million and distributions from Senior Healthcare of $2.4 million, partially offset by the acquisition of property and equipment and construction expenditures of $11.7 million and management and lease acquisition costs of $2.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and was comprised primarily of the acquisition of property and equipment and construction expenditures of $6.6 million and management and lease acquisition costs of $8.8 million, partially offset by the proceeds from sale of property of $11.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash used in financing activities was $16.2 million. We paid capital lease and financing obligations of $19.0 million, debentures of $5.4 million, long term debt of $3.2 million, and increased restricted deposits by $2.9 million, partially offset by new long term borrowings of $8.9 million, proceeds from the sale of stock of $4.7 million, and the tax benefit for stock compensation costs of $1.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in financing activities was $17.4 million. We incurred new long term borrowings of $32.2 million to refinance $21.3 million in debt, pay $100,000 in financing costs, and pay $10.8 million in accumulated preferred dividends. In addition, we made scheduled principal payments of $1.9 million on long term debt, $16.1 million on capital lease and financing obligations, and paid $2.0 million for restricted deposits, of which $1.0 million related to new borrowings and the balance in lease deposits and paid $731,000 in other debt and financing costs. We received proceeds from the sale of stock of approximately $1.2 million and a tax benefit for stock compensation costs of approximately $2.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash used in financing activities was $14.3 million. We incurred new long term borrowings of $26.6 million to refinance $23.0 million in debt and fund $3.6 million in transaction costs. In addition, we made scheduled principal payments of $3.1 million on long term debt, retired $7.1 million in long term debt, and paid $8.8 million on capital lease and financing obligations. We received proceeds from the sale of stock of approximately $1.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not generate sufficient cash from operating activities to meet all our principal payment obligations on long term debt, capital and financing leases and capital expenditure requirements contained in many of our leases. In 2006, we had payment obligations for long term debt and capital and financing leases totaling approximately $25.1 million. We had $14.0 million of available cash at December 31, 2006, to fund any 2007 payment requirements in excess of cash generated from operations, but will need to improve our operating performance or seek other sources of cash to continue to meet our payment obligations in future years. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and have a working capital deficit of $41.9 million at December 31, 2006. Due to the nature of our business, it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because revenues are collected much more quickly, often in advance, than obligations are required to be paid. The result is a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities. Along those lines, the working capital deficit includes $15.1 million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income. The level of current liabilities is not expected to increase from year to year in such a way as to require the use of significant cash, except for debt maturities of $81.2 million scheduled to be due in 2008, which amount has been reduced to $65.1 million after the $16.1 million conversion of debentures into common stock in March 2007. The remaining balances consists primarily of $10.5 million in debentures that are convertible into common stock at the rate of $22 per share, $20.8 million in mortgage debt on five owned communities, and two notes of $10.8 million and $21.4 million that are secured by operating leases. We intend to refinance these obligations prior to their respective due dates. 68 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents As more thoroughly discussed under Legal Proceedings, we settled a Texas lawsuit in March 2006 for $5.6 million, which was significantly lower than what we had previously accrued, the net effect of which is shown as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations. As discussed above, while our occupancy and revenue per unit grew from the comparable prior year period, they grew more slowly than our targeted growth. While there is some indication that this is characteristic of the assisted living industry, we are responding through increased marketing initiatives, programs that address resident mix, increased maintenance and capital expenditures and other community level expenses to attract additional long term residents. We believe that these initiatives will have a positive impact on operating performance over time. During 2005, we sold our investment in Alterra for approximately $62.3 million in cash, which had a significant positive effect on our cash position and our working capital deficit and provided funds to meet our payment obligations while we worked to improve operating performance. For most of 2005, we had $32.0 million principal amount of 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures that matured January 1, 2006. Of the full principal amount, $5.4 million was paid at maturity in January 2006. The remaining $26.6 million principal amount of debentures were replaced with new 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures that are due July 1, 2008, pursuant to an exchange offer completed by us in November 2005. (See Note (6) Convertible Debentures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In March 2007, as a result of an offer to pay a cash incentive if holders converted their debentures to common stock, $16.1 million principal amount of debentures was converted into common stock and are no longer outstanding. We will pay $1.5 million in connection with such conversion on April 16, 2007. In 2006, 2005, and 2004, we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. However, the cash flows have not always been sufficient to pay all our long term obligations and we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations. We cannot guarantee that, if necessary in the future, such transactions will be available timely or at all, or on terms attractive to us. In 2002, and continuing through 2005, we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations, extending the maturities of such financings to dates in 2008 or thereafter, at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations. As a consequence of our property and lease transactions in 2006, our long term debt has increased from $80.5 million at December 31, 2005, to $86.5 million at December 31, 2006. Our obligations under operating leases have decreased from $338.9 million to $299.3 million, and our capital lease and financing obligations have decreased from $626.7 million to $608.2 million. In particular, the number of communities we lease increased from 109 at December 31, 2003, to 161 at December 31, 2006. We believe that, on the basis of the operating results of these communities (many of which we managed) prior to the commencement of the leases, the cash flow from such communities will be adequate to support the increased lease obligations. Many of our debt instruments and leases contain "cross default" provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor. Such cross default provisions affect the majority of our properties. Accordingly, any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted. Defaults can include certain financial covenants, which generally relate to lease coverage and cash flow. In addition, we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we were in violation of one or more covenants in certain of our leases, but obtained waivers from the owners such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus, were not in default. The waivers expire on January 1, 2008. Management believes that we will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow or have adequate cash reserves for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures through at least 2007. 69 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (In thousands): Principal and Lease Payments Due by Period After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt, including current portion $ 86,460 $ 2,863 $ 56,589 $ 4,841 $ 22,167 Capital lease and financing obligations, including current portion 608,166 22,254 54,890 70,252 460,770 Operating leases 299,345 41,164 84,176 80,570 93,435 Convertible debentures 26,575 26,575 $ 1,020,546 $ 66,281 $ 222,230 $ 155,663 $ 576,372 In March 2007, $16.1 million of our $26.6 million in convertible debentures were converted to common stock and are no longer outstanding. The remaining balance of $10.5 million is due in 2008. The following table summarizes interest on our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, (In thousands): Interest Due by Period After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years years Long term debt $ 19,792 $ 7,461 $ 6,928 $ 3,673 $ 1,730 Capital lease and financing obligations 324,426 40,007 75,288 67,362 141,769 Convertible debentures 3,322 1,661 1,661 $ 347,540 $ 49,129 $ 83,877 $ 71,035 $ 143,499 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on de recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Interpretation requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement could have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, but we do not expect it to be significant. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying current year financial statement misstatements. The interpretations in SAB 108, which expresses the SECs staff views, were issued to address the diversity in the practice of quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for a build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The SEC staff indicated that companies should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in material misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, and we adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 70 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Impact of Inflation To date, inflation has not had a significant impact on Emeritus. Inflation could, however, affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population, most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services. The monthly charges for the residents unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition. Our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited. We typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs, which accounted for approximately 13.3% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. In pricing our services, we attempt to anticipate inflation levels, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future. Non GAAP Measures A non GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most GAAP measures. In this report, we define and use the non GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, as set forth below: Definition of Adjusted EBITDA: We define Adjusted EBITDA as follows: Net income (loss) to common shareholders before: preferred stock dividends, gains or losses, net of tax, in discontinued operations, provision or benefit for income taxes, equity earnings or losses in unconsolidated joint ventures, gains or losses on sale of assets or investments, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, amortization of deferred gains, non cash stock option compensation expense, interest expense, interest income, and other non cash unusual adjustments Adjusted EBITDA Managements Use of Adjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our overall financial and operating performance. We believe this non GAAP measure, as we have defined it, is useful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because it excludes items that have little or no significance on our day to day operations. This measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed. Adjusted EBITDA provides us with a measure of financial performance, independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term, such as depreciation and amortization, taxation, and interest expense associated with our capital structure. This metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term, namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry. 71 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Table of Contents Limitations of Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. It should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of earnings. Material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings (losses) to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and using this non GAAP financial measure as compared to GAAP net income (loss) includes: The items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant affect on our financial results, Items determined to be non recurring in nature could, nevertheless, re occur in the future, and Depreciation and amortization, while not directly impacting our current cash position, does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties. If the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures, then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities. An investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our performance and results of operations. We use this non GAAP measure to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative to net income (loss), income from continuing operations, or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. You should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any such GAAP financial measure. We strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA presented below, along with our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, and cash flows. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below shows the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2006 2005 2006 2005 Net income (loss) from common shareholders $ (5,296 ) $ 18,550 $ (14,618 ) $ 11,703 Preferred dividends 599 (Gain) loss on sale, net of tax benefit, in discontinued operations (1,131 ) 1,767 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (1,077 ) 8,147 (3,044 ) 9,358 Equity (earnings) losses in unconsolidated joint ventures 363 89 993 (2,188 ) (Gains) losses on sale of long term investments (34,118 ) (55,441 ) Depreciation and amortization 13,257 11,850 50,478 46,277 Impairment loss on long term investment 829 829 Amortization of deferred gains (553 ) (553 ) (2,214 ) (2,215 ) Non cash stock option compensation expenses 575 2,780 Interest expense 12,465 12,728 49,252 50,144 Interest income (582 ) (623 ) (2,893 ) (1,507 ) Other non cash unusual activity: Reversal of Texas settlement accrued in 2004 (12,207 ) Professional and workers compensation liability adjustments (2,674 ) 4,563 Adjusted EBITDA $ 19,981 $ 14,939 $ 66,682 $ 63,060 72 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading, none of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our debt and capital lease and financing obligations, the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of December 31, 2006. Expected maturity date (In thousands) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair value Average interest rate Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 2,863 $ 54,640 $ 1,949 $ 1,588 $ 3,253 $ 22,167 $ 86,460 $ 84,617 8.61 % Capital lease and financing obligations $ 22,254 $ 25,664 $ 29,226 $ 33,061 $ 37,191 $ 460,770 $ 608,166 $ 453,221 6.70 % Convertible debentures $ $ 26,575 $ $ $ $ $ 26,575 $ 28,804 6.25 % In March 2007, $16.1 million of our $26.6 million in convertible debentures were converted to common stock and are no longer outstanding. The remaining balance of $10.5 million is due in 2008. At December 31, 2006, we had no variable rate borrowings so our earnings are not affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings. However, we do have certain operating lease obligations based on LIBOR, with a LIBOR cap of approximately 5.3%. As of December 31, 2006, the LIBOR rate was at the 5.3% cap and we currently have no variable rate exposure for additional lease expense. This analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to December 31, 2006. This analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment, nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change.
