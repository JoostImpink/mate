ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012, and our expectations for fiscal 2015. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" in the General Information section of this Report and the "Risk Factors" listed in Part IItem 1A of this Report.Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2014 was a 52 week year, fiscal 2013 was a 53 week year, and fiscal 2012 was a 52 week year. Fiscal 2015 will be a 52 week year. Executive OverviewWe operate a chain of more than 8,000 general merchandise retail discount stores in 46 states, providing consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes Consumables, Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics. We classify the combination of Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics as "Discretionary." We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10.We believe during fiscal 2014, our customers continued to face increased financial pressures, including continued high unemployment rates, increased payroll taxes, and volatility in gasoline prices. In fiscal 2014, customers focused their spending on necessities, with sales in Consumables comprising 73.4% of our total sales. In addition, our industry remains highly competitive on the basis of store locations, convenience, price and quality of merchandise, in stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service. In fiscal 2014, these trends continued to pressure our profitability. As a result of these pressures, we initiated an in depth business review to identify opportunities to strengthen our value proposition, increase operational efficiencies, and improve financial performance. In the second half of fiscal 2014, we implemented a series of strategic initiatives, including investing to permanently lower prices on nearly 1,000 basic items, closing 377 underperforming stores across the chain, and reducing expenses through workforce optimization. Although these internal strategic initiatives position us to deliver stronger returns, we continued to evaluate external strategic alternatives, which led us to enter into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, as discussed in the Business section above. During fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, our net sales increased 0.9% to $10.49 billion. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2014 decreased 2.1%, as compared to fiscal 2013. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2014 included 52 weeks, as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2013. Excluding the additional week of sales in fiscal 2013, our net sales increased 2.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. As a result of decreased comparable store sales and charges associated with our restructuring initiatives, our net income decreased to $284.5 million, and our diluted net income per common share decreased to $2.49.During fiscal 2014, we remained focused on achieving our four corporate goals: deliver profitable sales growth; build customer loyalty and experience; develop diverse, high performing teams; and drive continuous improvement. We completed the following in fiscal 2014:We completed internal restructuring initiatives including a reduction of corporate overhead, closing 377 underperforming stores, and lowering prices on nearly 1,000 basic items.We opened 526 new stores and renovated, relocated or expanded 738 stores.We converted two distribution centers to a pallet delivery system and began conversion of a third distribution center. We added more than 700 private brand SKUs through a combination of introduction of new items and conversion of existing control brands to private brand.We reduced store manager turnover by approximately 18%, as compared to fiscal 2013.We deployed new technology aimed at reducing inventory shrinkage in approximately 65% of the chain.We upgraded our point of sale system in more than 1,100 stores to improve the checkout experience.29Fiscal 2015 OutlookOn July 27, 2014, we entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement. The following outlook only considers Family Dollar as a standalone company and excludes any outlook from the pending business combination.In fiscal 2015, we plan to continue to execute and evaluate our initiatives designed to deliver profitable sales growth, build customer loyalty and experience, and drive continuous improvement.During fiscal 2015, we expect to open approximately 375 new stores and close 40 stores, for a net store growth of 335. Additionally, we plan to renovate, relocate, or expand approximately 775 stores. To deliver even more compelling value to our customers, we lowered prices on nearly 1,000 basic items during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we expect to sustain everyday low costs by proactively managing our product assortment and critically reviewing pricing in all product categories. We also plan to expand our program which allows customers to present a local competitors printed ad in our stores, and we guarantee Family Dollar will match their price. To increase relevancy with our customers and drive discretionary spend, we expect we will accelerate our rollout of beer and wine and expand our tobacco assortment. Additionally, reflecting trends in customer demand and the diversity of our store base, we will be launching an initiative to cluster assortments based on market dynamics, while creating a flexible supply chain and market specific store formats to drive higher productivity and return on investment. In fiscal 2014, we expanded our private brand assortment. In fiscal 2015 we expect to continue penetration of private brands, including a refresh of certain private brands in Consumables to offer our customers more quality and value while broadening their appeal. We intend to drive greater awareness of our private brands program through right sized marketing and improved visual merchandising support.We have increased global sourcing and plan to continue to utilize global sourcing as it remains an opportunity to increase profitability. In fiscal 2015, we plan to focus on the quality and value of sourced products, and to continue to expand our supplier network in an effort to increase the level and amount of direct imports. Non GAAP MeasuresIn our analysis of the results of operations, we utilized non GAAP financial measures for operating profit, net income and diluted net income per common share. We believe these non GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing meaningful information relevant to events that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. In the measures presented, we have excluded the restructuring charges and merger related fees as presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements because the exclusion of such amounts facilitates the comparison of the Companys financial results to its historical operating results. However, these supplemental measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the related measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles operating profit, income before taxes, net income, and diluted net income per common share (GAAP financial measures) for the periods presented to adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share (non GAAP financial measures) for the periods presented.30 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended(in thousands, except per share amounts) August 30, 2014 August 31, 2013 August 25, 2012Operating profit $421,452 $687,957 $664,213Cost of sales restructuring 11,930 Restructuring 78,180 Merger fees 9,434 Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (4,953) Litigation charge 11,500Adjusted operating profit $520,996 $683,004 $675,713 Income before taxes $422,754 $690,697 $663,938Cost of sales restructuring 11,930 Restructuring 78,180 Merger fees 9,434 Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (4,953) Litigation charge 11,500Adjusted income before taxes $522,298 $685,744 $675,438 Net income $284,503 $443,575 $422,240After tax impact of Cost of sales restructuring 7,762 After tax impact of Restructuring 50,864 After tax impact of Merger fees 6,138 After tax impact of Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (3,175) After tax impact of Litigation charge 7,140Adjusted net income $349,267 $440,400 $429,380 Diluted net income per common share $2.49 $3.83 $3.58Per share impact of Cost of sales restructuring 0.07 Per share impact of Restructuring 0.44 Per share impact of Merger fees 0.05 Per share impact of Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (0.03) Per share impact of Litigation charge 0.06Adjusted diluted net income per common share $3.05 $3.80 $3.64Results of OperationsOur results of operations for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: 31 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended(in thousands) August 30, 2014% of Net Sales* August 31, 2013% of Net Sales* August 25, 2012% of Net Sales*Net sales $10,489,330 $10,391,457 $9,331,005Cost and expenses: Cost of sales** 6,946,11566.2% 6,836,71265.8% 6,071,05865.1%Cost of sales restructuring 11,9300.1% % %Selling, general and administrative 3,022,21928.8% 2,866,78827.6% 2,584,23427.7%Restructuring 78,1800.7% % %Merger fees 9,4340.1% % %Litigation charge % % 11,5000.1%Cost of sales and operating expenses 10,067,87896.0% 9,703,50093.4% 8,666,79292.9%Operating profit 421,4524.0% 687,9576.6% 664,2137.1%Investment income 190% 422% 927%Interest expense 30,0380.3% 25,8880.2% 25,0900.3%Other Income 31,1500.3% 28,2060.3% 23,8880.3%Income before income taxes 422,7544.0% 690,6976.7% 663,9387.1%Income taxes 138,2511.3% 247,1222.4% 241,6982.6%Net Income $284,5032.7% $443,5754.3% $422,2404.5%*Percentages are rounded.**Included in Cost of Sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances.Comparison of Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2013 Net SalesNet sales increased 0.9% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, which was primarily due to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2013 included an extra week. The additional week accounted for approximately $189 million in net sales for fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of the extra week of sales in fiscal 2013, net sales in fiscal 2014 increased 2.8%. The average number of stores in operation increased to 8,095 in fiscal 2014, from 7,680 fiscal 2013, or an increase of 5.4%. Comparable store sales growth describes the change in net sales in any period for stores considered comparable to the prior period. Comparable store sales include net sales at stores that have been open more than 13 months. A store becomes comparable the first calendar week it has sales after 13 months of being open. Renovated, relocated, or expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may be different than similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Comparable store sales were strongest in the Consumables category, however all categories had negative comparable sales in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. There was a 2.1% decrease in total comparable store sales in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, as a result of a decrease in customer transactions in comparable stores, which was partially offset by an increase in average customer transaction values. During fiscal 2014, the number of customer transactions decreased approximately 2.6%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 0.5%, as compared to fiscal 2013. Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.2% in fiscal 2014 and 65.8% in fiscal 2013. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was negatively impacted by the following:A shift in sales mix to lower margin consumable merchandise. An increase in lower margin Consumables, as well as softness in sales of higher margin Discretionary items, continued to pressure cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. A decrease in markups on merchandise sales. As we remain committed to strengthening our value perception, we lowered prices on nearly 1,000 basic items during fiscal 2014.32An increase in markdowns. In a challenging macro economic environment, we continued to use markdowns to drive revenue growth and manage inventory levels as we continued to refine our assortment of Consumables merchandise. Vendor allowance adjustment in fiscal 2013. Included in Cost of sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following:Lower freight expense. The decrease in freight expense was impacted by our ongoing relationship with McLane, which resulted in less merchandise being handled through our own distribution network.A decrease in inventory shrinkage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage resulted from technology introduced into stores and decreased store manager turnover. Cost of Sales RestructuringIn the second half of fiscal 2014, the Company closed 377 underperforming stores across the chain as part of a series of restructuring initiatives. Inventory write downs of $11.9 million were included in Cost of Sales Restructuring and were incurred to sell through merchandise at stores closed as part of the restructuring initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 5.4% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 27.6% in fiscal 2013. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, de leveraged in the following categories as a result of the decrease in comparable store sales, as compared to the fiscal 2013:Increased store occupancy costs (approximately 0.9% of net sales).Increased store payroll costs (approximately 0.3% of net sales).These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following:Lower incentive compensation expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.Decreased advertising costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). We continued to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising through changes in the timing, number of pages, and type of merchandise included in our promotional materials, which resulted in a decrease in overall advertising spending, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.RestructuringIn the second half of fiscal 2014, the Company implemented a series of restructuring initiatives, including closing 377 underperforming stores across the chain and optimized our workforce through a headcount reduction. The $78.2 million charge included in Restructuring consists primarily of future lease obligations and property and equipment impairments related to the store closures and termination benefits associated with the workforce optimization. Merger FeesOn July 27, 2014, we entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of which a subsidiary of Dollar Tree will be merged with and into Family Dollar, with Family Dollar continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Dollar Tree. In executing the Dollar Tree merger agreement, the Company incurred $9.4 million of professional fees during fiscal 2014, consisting primarily of financial advisory and legal costs. Investment Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income The changes in investment income, interest expense and other income in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 were not material.Income Taxes33 The effective tax rate was 32.7% for fiscal 2014, as compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2013. The effective tax rate was lower primarily due to tax benefits associated with federal jobs tax credits, foreign tax benefits associated with global sourcing, and favorable changes in the reserves for uncertain tax positions.Comparison of Fiscal 2013 to Fiscal 2012 Net Sales Net sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2013 included an extra week, which accounted for approximately $189 million in net sales, or approximately 2.0% of the net sales increase. Additionally, the net sales increase in fiscal 2013 reflects an increase in comparable store sales and new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales increased 3.0% in the fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, as a result of an increase in both customer transactions in comparable stores and average customer transaction values. During fiscal 2013, the number of customer transactions increased approximately 1.7%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.3%, as compared to fiscal 2012. Sales during fiscal 2013, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in the Consumables category. The average number of stores in operation during fiscal 2013 was 6.7% higher than the average number of stores in operation during fiscal 2012. We had 7,916 stores in operation at the end of fiscal 2013, as compared to 7,442 stores in operation at the end of fiscal 2012. As of August 31, 2013, we had, in the aggregate, approximately 56.8 million square feet of selling space, as compared to 53.2 million square feet as of August 25, 2012.Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 12.6% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to additional sales volume. Included in Cost of sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 65.8% in fiscal 2013, as compared to 65.1% in fiscal 2012. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was negatively impacted by the following:A shift in sales mix to lower margin consumable merchandise. An increase in lower margin Consumables, as well as softness in sales of Discretionary items, pressured cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. An increase in inventory shrinkage. While our inventory levels were lower on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, the average inventory balance in our stores was higher throughout fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. Inventory shrinkage increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due in part to increased average inventory levels throughout fiscal 2013.An increase in markdowns. In a challenging macro economic environment, we used markdowns to drive revenue growth as we refined our assortment of Consumables merchandise. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following: An increase in markups on merchandise sales. We focused on improving our purchase markups through better price management, expanded our global sourcing efforts, and developed our private brand assortment, which resulted in higher gross profit margin.A decrease in freight expense. The decrease in freight expense was impacted by our relationship with McLane, which began in September 2012 and resulted in less merchandise being handled through our own distribution network.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 10.9% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in these expenses was due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 27.6% in fiscal 2013, as compared to 27.7% in fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of the following, as compared to fiscal 2012:Decreased non store payroll costs, including incentive compensation expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. 34This favorable item was partially offset by the following:Increased store occupancy costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Rent expense increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily driven by the additional rental expense on the 532 stores sold pursuant to sale leaseback transactions in the second half of fiscal 2012 and in fiscal 2013. Litigation Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an $11.5 million litigation charge associated with the preliminary settlement of a lawsuit in the state of New York. This lawsuit involved claims for overtime pay from New York store managers who worked in our stores. Investment Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income The changes in investment income, interest expense and other income in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 were not material.Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 35.8% for fiscal 2013, as compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the reserve for state taxes and an increase in the benefit of federal tax credits, partially offset by an increase in the reserves for uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. During fiscal 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.2 million from the end of fiscal 2013, and our operating cash flows were $469.2 million. We believe our operating cash flows, proceeds from sale leaseback transactions, and credit facilities are sufficient to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, share repurchases, cash dividend payments, and principal and interest payments. We have availability under our two credit facilities to borrow up to $900 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for our insurance programs of $18.7 million as of August 30, 2014, to supplement operating cash flows. During fiscal 2014, to help supplement our operating cash flows and to support our growth initiatives, we had an average daily outstanding balance of $214.8 million on our unsecured revolving credit facilities. As of August 30, 2014, we had no short term borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 was $973.0 million, as compared to $776.8 million at the end of fiscal 2013. We believe operating cash flows and capacity under existing credit facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives.Restricted Cash and InvestmentsWe have restricted a portion of cash and investments to serve as collateral for certain of our insurance obligations held at our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These restricted funds cannot be withdrawn from the Companys account without the consent of the secured party. As of August 30, 2014, the Company held $34.4 million in this restricted account, of which $31.4 million was included in Restricted Cash and Investments and $3.0 million was included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 31, 2013, we held $55.5 million in this restricted account, of which $35.4 million was included in Restricted Cash and Investments and $20.1 million was included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The classification between current and non current is based on the timing of expected payments of the secured insurance obligations. The decrease in restricted cash and investments, as compared to fiscal 2013, is attributable to a reduction in the required collateralization amount related to workers compensation insurance claims. Build to Suit and Sale Leaseback TransactionsThe Company uses build to suit and sale leaseback transactions to construct and lease new stores. In a build to suit transaction, an unrelated third party funds the new store construction and owns the property throughout and upon completion of construction. In a sale leaseback transaction, the Company funds the new store construction and owns the property throughout and upon completion of construction. Upon completion of the stores construction in build to suit transactions and concurrent with the sale of stores in sale leaseback transactions, the Company enters into agreements to lease the properties over an initial 35term of 15 years, with four, 5 year fixed renewal options. The Company evaluates each store individually upon certain events during the life of the lease, including individual renewal options. The Company classifies these leases as operating leases, actively uses the leased properties, and considers the leases as normal sale leasebacks. During fiscal 2014, the Company completed 356 build to suit transactions to support new store growth. Additionally, the Company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold 159 stores to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of approximately $194.8 million during fiscal 2014. Upon closing of the transactions, the Company realized a gain on the sale of the stores of $28.4 million, of which $1.1 million was recognized immediately and approximately $27.3 million was deferred and will amortize over the initial lease terms. During fiscal 2013, the Company completed 230 build to suit transactions. Additionally, the Company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold 256 stores and 29 parcels of land to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of approximately $345.2 million. Upon closing of the transactions, the Company realized a gain on the sale of the stores of $84.7 million, of which approximately $2.4 million was recognized immediately and approximately $82.3 million was deferred and will amortize over the initial lease terms. Credit Facilities On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $600 million. The credit facility matures on November 13, 2018, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into a four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $300 million. The credit facility matures on November 13, 2017, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The revolving credit facilities provide the Company the capacity to borrow up to $900 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for its insurance program of $18.7 million as of August 30, 2014. The prior unsecured revolving credit facilities provided the Company the capacity to borrow up to $700 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for its insurance program of $18.8 million as of August 31, 2013.The Company had no short term borrowings outstanding under its unsecured revolving credit facilities as of August 30, 2014, or as of August 31, 2013. During fiscal 2014, the Company had no net borrowings and had an average daily outstanding balance of $214.8 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.4% under its unsecured revolving credit facilities. This compares to net repayments of $15.0 million and an average daily outstanding balance of $141.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.5% under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facilities during fiscal 2013. The Companys unsecured revolving credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Long Term DebtOn January 28, 2011, the Company issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2021 (the "2021 Notes"), through a public offering. The Companys proceeds were approximately $298.5 million, net of an issuance discount of $1.5 million. In addition, the Company incurred issuance costs of approximately $3.3 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2011. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness. The Company may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, subject to a make whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, the Company may be required to repurchase the 2021 Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured senior notes due September 27, 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), to a group of institutional accredited investors. The 2015 Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first 36tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization which commenced on September 27, 2011, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche had a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27, 2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27, 2015. The Company has made all required principal payments from September 2011 through September 2014. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 27 and September 27 of each year. The 2015 Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.Other ConsiderationsDuring the second half of fiscal 2014, we implemented strategic restructuring initiatives, which are expected to result in annualized operating profit benefit of $40 million to $45 million. The operating profit benefits began to be realized in fiscal 2014 and consisted primarily of reduced labor expense related to the headcount reductions and operating profit benefits associated with the closed stores. We expect to continue to incur cash outlays associated with the lease obligations pursuant to the contractual obligations of the leases. The lease obligations for the stores closed as part of the restructuring initiatives are included in the aggregate minimum annual rental under operating leases as discussed below.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, under which Dollar Tree will acquire Family Dollar in a cash and stock transaction. In conjunction with the Dollar Tree merger agreement, the Company incurred $9.4 million of professional fees during fiscal 2014, consisting primarily of financial advisory and legal costs. In fiscal 2015, the Company estimates it will incur between $45 million and $55 million of additional professional fees related to the pending merger. Our inventory per store increased 8.0%, as compared to the end of fiscal 2013, primarily driven by the accelerated receipt of shipments and in transit inventory for holiday merchandise. Total merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2014 increased 9.7%, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to both the accelerated receipt of shipments and the new stores opened during fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were $436.3 million, as compared to $744.4 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to a shift to build to suit transactions from sale leaseback transactions in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and the completion of construction for the eleventh distribution center in fiscal 2013. A summary of spending in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is as follows: 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended(in thousands) August 30, 2014 August 31, 2013New stores $148,947 $385,191Store renovations 141,400 149,120Existing stores 72,858 52,972Supply chain 31,006 76,002Corporate and technology investments 42,077 81,143Total capital expenditures $436,288 $744,428The total number of stores open at year end increased 1.6% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. However, the average store count increased 5.4% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. The total number of stores at year end increased 6.4% in fiscal 2013 and the average store count increased 6.7% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The average store count is calculated as rolling 13 month average using the ending store count per fiscal month. A summary of store information is as follows:37 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Store count beginning of year 7,916 7,442 7,023New stores 526 500 475Closed stores 400 26 56Store count end of year 8,042 7,916 7,442 Total relocated, expanded, and renovated stores 738 830 854Total selling square feet (in thousands) 58,112 56,846 53,207Average store count 8,095 7,680 7,197During fiscal 2014, the Company purchased a total of 1.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $125.0 million. All shares were purchased pursuant to share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors. As of August 30, 2014, the Company had $245.8 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase programs do not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions, or other structured transactions.In addition to the Restricted Cash and Investments noted above, our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains unrestricted balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of August 30, 2014, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $4.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively.Additionally, during fiscal 2014, we continued to develop our global sourcing teams in Europe and Asia, by enhancing our integration processes, and expanding our supplier network. As of August 30, 2014, we had $42.5 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign entities. We are not dependent on dividends from our foreign entities to fund our domestic operations. Unremitted earnings from foreign entities, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, would become subject to U.S. income taxes if they were remitted as dividends or were lent to a domestic entity. Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2014, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $469.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $472.0 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was due primarily to changes in merchandise inventories, prepayments and other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, all in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we incurred non cash charges for restructuring activities, including an impairment on property and equipment, lease obligations on closed stores, and fees related to our pending merger with Dollar Tree. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on these activities.During fiscal 2013, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $472.0 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $369.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to a reduction in payments for merchandise inventories in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, which was offset partially by changes in prepayments and other current assets and income taxes, all in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows From Investing Activities During fiscal 2014, we had net cash used in investing activities of $200.0 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $314.6 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in capital expenditures and net proceeds from sale leaseback transactions, which are included in the other considerations discussion above. During fiscal 2013, we had net cash used in investing activities of $314.6 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $198.3 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures as a result of opening new stores under our sale leaseback program, offset partially by net changes in restricted cash and investments and investment securities. Cash Flows From Financing Activities38 During fiscal 2014, we had net cash used in financing activities of $270.3 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities $108.7 million during fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.During fiscal 2013, we had net cash used in financing activities of $108.7 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $220.1 million during fiscal 2012. We purchased $75.0 million of our common stock during fiscal 2013 as compared to $191.6 million in fiscal 2012, a decrease in share repurchases of $116.6 million. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2014. Merchandise letters of credit represent obligations due within the next year to suppliers for merchandise the Company has agreed to purchase. Construction obligations relate primarily to amounts due to developers for new store construction projects, which have yet to be completed. Minimum royalty payments are related to an exclusive agreement to sell certain branded merchandise.

At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $4.8 million, which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our tax liabilities.The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2014. (in thousands) Total AmountsCommittedStandby letters of credit $48,695Surety bonds 49,256Total $97,951A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit, which are primarily renewed on an annual basis, is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this discussion.We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which we may choose to cancel. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.Pending Merger CommitmentsThe Dollar Tree merger agreement contains provisions that in the event of termination of the Dollar Tree merger agreement, Family Dollar may be required to pay to Dollar Tree its out of pocket expenses, not to exceed $90 million, if the merger agreement is terminated by either Dollar Tree or Family Dollar because Family Dollar fails to obtain the required stockholder approval at the Family Dollar stockholders meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed). In addition, Family Dollar may be required to pay a termination fee of $305 million, less any payment paid in respect of Dollar Trees out of pocket expenses, 39under certain circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of Family Dollar or termination of the Dollar Tree merger agreement by Family Dollar to enter into an agreement for a "Company Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Dollar Tree merger agreement). As of August 30, 2014, no amount has been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements related to these provisions. Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases included in the "Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments" section above. Our operating lease obligations are primarily related to payments due under noncancelable store leases. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014 09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014 09"). The ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014 09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014 09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014 09 during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact of this ASU on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued updated tax regulations for the Deduction and Capitalization of Expenditures Related to Tangible Property. The regulations can be adopted early; however, the mandatory effective date for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2015. These regulations provide additional guidance related to the capitalization and expensing of fixed assets, repairs, and other expenditure types related to the updated tax regulations. Based upon the Companys analysis, the regulations are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013 11 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ("ASU 2013 11"). The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company will adopt ASU 2013 11 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013 02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2013 02"). ASU 2013 02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The ASU was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Merchandise Inventories:Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less markup percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of 40which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $79.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $77.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2013. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2014. As a result of the strategic initiative to close 377 underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014, an additional $11.9 million of markdowns were incurred to sell through inventory at these stores. Additionally, an adjustment to shrink expense was made to Cost of sales for any inventory balance remaining on the books and records after the stores were closed. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities.Property and Equipment:We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally between five and fifteen years), including reasonably assured renewal options, or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The increase in gross property and equipment, before depreciation, is not commensurate with capital expenditures as a result of the impairment recorded for 377 underperforming stores closed as part of the Companys strategic initiatives in fiscal 2014 and as a result of the significant amount of assets sold during the year under sale leaseback transactions. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As a result of the strategic initiative to close underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014, an impairment of $19.9 million on property and equipment was recorded in fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment.Insurance Liabilities:We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or if the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations.We record our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis, and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Our total liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs were $224.9 million ($52.6 million current and $172.3 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $232.1 million ($52.2 million current and $179.9 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2013. The current portion of the liabilities is included in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Liabilities. The insurance assets related to these amounts totaled $29.7 million ($2.1 million current and $27.6 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $31.7 million ($2.5 million current and $29.2 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2013. The current portion of the assets is included in Prepayments and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Assets. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013. Our insurance 41expense during fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities:We are subject to routine income tax audits in the normal course of business, and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various taxing authorities, as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $24.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $30.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2013. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities.Contingent Legal Liabilities:We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our total legal liabilities were not material as of the end of fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2014. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities.Liabilities for Closed Stores:From time to time, we vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the present value of our future lease payments and related costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease terms, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate disposition experts; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using our incremental borrowing interest rates that coincide with the remaining lease terms. As of August 30, 2014, we recorded a liability of $43.7 million related to the strategic initiative to close 377 underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014. Of this liability, $13.3 million was included in Accrued liabilities and $30.4 million was included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities.Stock based Compensation Expense:We measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price, as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued, which is dependent upon the Companys performance relative to a peer group. If factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 include stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million, $16.3 million, and $15.9 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2014. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on stock based compensation.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings under our credit facility. As of August 30, 422014, the analysis indicated such a movement would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we incurred an immaterial amount of interest expense related to our credit facilities. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our credit facilities.43

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012, and our expectations for fiscal 2015. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Report. Our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" in the General Information section of this Report and the "Risk Factors" listed in Part IItem 1A of this Report.Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday closest to August 31 of each year, which generally results in an extra week every six years. Fiscal 2014 was a 52 week year, fiscal 2013 was a 53 week year, and fiscal 2012 was a 52 week year. Fiscal 2015 will be a 52 week year. Executive OverviewWe operate a chain of more than 8,000 general merchandise retail discount stores in 46 states, providing consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our merchandise assortment includes Consumables, Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics. We classify the combination of Home Products, Apparel and Accessories, and Seasonal and Electronics as "Discretionary." We sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than $1 to $10.We believe during fiscal 2014, our customers continued to face increased financial pressures, including continued high unemployment rates, increased payroll taxes, and volatility in gasoline prices. In fiscal 2014, customers focused their spending on necessities, with sales in Consumables comprising 73.4% of our total sales. In addition, our industry remains highly competitive on the basis of store locations, convenience, price and quality of merchandise, in stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service. In fiscal 2014, these trends continued to pressure our profitability. As a result of these pressures, we initiated an in depth business review to identify opportunities to strengthen our value proposition, increase operational efficiencies, and improve financial performance. In the second half of fiscal 2014, we implemented a series of strategic initiatives, including investing to permanently lower prices on nearly 1,000 basic items, closing 377 underperforming stores across the chain, and reducing expenses through workforce optimization. Although these internal strategic initiatives position us to deliver stronger returns, we continued to evaluate external strategic alternatives, which led us to enter into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, as discussed in the Business section above. During fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, our net sales increased 0.9% to $10.49 billion. Comparable store sales (stores open more than 13 months) for fiscal 2014 decreased 2.1%, as compared to fiscal 2013. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2014 included 52 weeks, as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2013. Excluding the additional week of sales in fiscal 2013, our net sales increased 2.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. As a result of decreased comparable store sales and charges associated with our restructuring initiatives, our net income decreased to $284.5 million, and our diluted net income per common share decreased to $2.49.During fiscal 2014, we remained focused on achieving our four corporate goals: deliver profitable sales growth; build customer loyalty and experience; develop diverse, high performing teams; and drive continuous improvement. We completed the following in fiscal 2014:We completed internal restructuring initiatives including a reduction of corporate overhead, closing 377 underperforming stores, and lowering prices on nearly 1,000 basic items.We opened 526 new stores and renovated, relocated or expanded 738 stores.We converted two distribution centers to a pallet delivery system and began conversion of a third distribution center. We added more than 700 private brand SKUs through a combination of introduction of new items and conversion of existing control brands to private brand.We reduced store manager turnover by approximately 18%, as compared to fiscal 2013.We deployed new technology aimed at reducing inventory shrinkage in approximately 65% of the chain.We upgraded our point of sale system in more than 1,100 stores to improve the checkout experience.29Fiscal 2015 OutlookOn July 27, 2014, we entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement. The following outlook only considers Family Dollar as a standalone company and excludes any outlook from the pending business combination.In fiscal 2015, we plan to continue to execute and evaluate our initiatives designed to deliver profitable sales growth, build customer loyalty and experience, and drive continuous improvement.During fiscal 2015, we expect to open approximately 375 new stores and close 40 stores, for a net store growth of 335. Additionally, we plan to renovate, relocate, or expand approximately 775 stores. To deliver even more compelling value to our customers, we lowered prices on nearly 1,000 basic items during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we expect to sustain everyday low costs by proactively managing our product assortment and critically reviewing pricing in all product categories. We also plan to expand our program which allows customers to present a local competitors printed ad in our stores, and we guarantee Family Dollar will match their price. To increase relevancy with our customers and drive discretionary spend, we expect we will accelerate our rollout of beer and wine and expand our tobacco assortment. Additionally, reflecting trends in customer demand and the diversity of our store base, we will be launching an initiative to cluster assortments based on market dynamics, while creating a flexible supply chain and market specific store formats to drive higher productivity and return on investment. In fiscal 2014, we expanded our private brand assortment. In fiscal 2015 we expect to continue penetration of private brands, including a refresh of certain private brands in Consumables to offer our customers more quality and value while broadening their appeal. We intend to drive greater awareness of our private brands program through right sized marketing and improved visual merchandising support.We have increased global sourcing and plan to continue to utilize global sourcing as it remains an opportunity to increase profitability. In fiscal 2015, we plan to focus on the quality and value of sourced products, and to continue to expand our supplier network in an effort to increase the level and amount of direct imports. Non GAAP MeasuresIn our analysis of the results of operations, we utilized non GAAP financial measures for operating profit, net income and diluted net income per common share. We believe these non GAAP financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing meaningful information relevant to events that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. In the measures presented, we have excluded the restructuring charges and merger related fees as presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements because the exclusion of such amounts facilitates the comparison of the Companys financial results to its historical operating results. However, these supplemental measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the related measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles operating profit, income before taxes, net income, and diluted net income per common share (GAAP financial measures) for the periods presented to adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share (non GAAP financial measures) for the periods presented.30 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended(in thousands, except per share amounts) August 30, 2014 August 31, 2013 August 25, 2012Operating profit $421,452 $687,957 $664,213Cost of sales restructuring 11,930 Restructuring 78,180 Merger fees 9,434 Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (4,953) Litigation charge 11,500Adjusted operating profit $520,996 $683,004 $675,713 Income before taxes $422,754 $690,697 $663,938Cost of sales restructuring 11,930 Restructuring 78,180 Merger fees 9,434 Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (4,953) Litigation charge 11,500Adjusted income before taxes $522,298 $685,744 $675,438 Net income $284,503 $443,575 $422,240After tax impact of Cost of sales restructuring 7,762 After tax impact of Restructuring 50,864 After tax impact of Merger fees 6,138 After tax impact of Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (3,175) After tax impact of Litigation charge 7,140Adjusted net income $349,267 $440,400 $429,380 Diluted net income per common share $2.49 $3.83 $3.58Per share impact of Cost of sales restructuring 0.07 Per share impact of Restructuring 0.44 Per share impact of Merger fees 0.05 Per share impact of Accounting adjustment vendor allowances (0.03) Per share impact of Litigation charge 0.06Adjusted diluted net income per common share $3.05 $3.80 $3.64Results of OperationsOur results of operations for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs: 31 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended(in thousands) August 30, 2014% of Net Sales* August 31, 2013% of Net Sales* August 25, 2012% of Net Sales*Net sales $10,489,330 $10,391,457 $9,331,005Cost and expenses: Cost of sales** 6,946,11566.2% 6,836,71265.8% 6,071,05865.1%Cost of sales restructuring 11,9300.1% % %Selling, general and administrative 3,022,21928.8% 2,866,78827.6% 2,584,23427.7%Restructuring 78,1800.7% % %Merger fees 9,4340.1% % %Litigation charge % % 11,5000.1%Cost of sales and operating expenses 10,067,87896.0% 9,703,50093.4% 8,666,79292.9%Operating profit 421,4524.0% 687,9576.6% 664,2137.1%Investment income 190% 422% 927%Interest expense 30,0380.3% 25,8880.2% 25,0900.3%Other Income 31,1500.3% 28,2060.3% 23,8880.3%Income before income taxes 422,7544.0% 690,6976.7% 663,9387.1%Income taxes 138,2511.3% 247,1222.4% 241,6982.6%Net Income $284,5032.7% $443,5754.3% $422,2404.5%*Percentages are rounded.**Included in Cost of Sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances.Comparison of Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2013 Net SalesNet sales increased 0.9% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, which was primarily due to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2013 included an extra week. The additional week accounted for approximately $189 million in net sales for fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of the extra week of sales in fiscal 2013, net sales in fiscal 2014 increased 2.8%. The average number of stores in operation increased to 8,095 in fiscal 2014, from 7,680 fiscal 2013, or an increase of 5.4%. Comparable store sales growth describes the change in net sales in any period for stores considered comparable to the prior period. Comparable store sales include net sales at stores that have been open more than 13 months. A store becomes comparable the first calendar week it has sales after 13 months of being open. Renovated, relocated, or expanded stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent they had sales during comparable weeks in each year. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable store sales calculation may be different than similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Comparable store sales were strongest in the Consumables category, however all categories had negative comparable sales in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. There was a 2.1% decrease in total comparable store sales in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, as a result of a decrease in customer transactions in comparable stores, which was partially offset by an increase in average customer transaction values. During fiscal 2014, the number of customer transactions decreased approximately 2.6%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 0.5%, as compared to fiscal 2013. Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 66.2% in fiscal 2014 and 65.8% in fiscal 2013. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was negatively impacted by the following:A shift in sales mix to lower margin consumable merchandise. An increase in lower margin Consumables, as well as softness in sales of higher margin Discretionary items, continued to pressure cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. A decrease in markups on merchandise sales. As we remain committed to strengthening our value perception, we lowered prices on nearly 1,000 basic items during fiscal 2014.32An increase in markdowns. In a challenging macro economic environment, we continued to use markdowns to drive revenue growth and manage inventory levels as we continued to refine our assortment of Consumables merchandise. Vendor allowance adjustment in fiscal 2013. Included in Cost of sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following:Lower freight expense. The decrease in freight expense was impacted by our ongoing relationship with McLane, which resulted in less merchandise being handled through our own distribution network.A decrease in inventory shrinkage. The decrease in inventory shrinkage resulted from technology introduced into stores and decreased store manager turnover. Cost of Sales RestructuringIn the second half of fiscal 2014, the Company closed 377 underperforming stores across the chain as part of a series of restructuring initiatives. Inventory write downs of $11.9 million were included in Cost of Sales Restructuring and were incurred to sell through merchandise at stores closed as part of the restructuring initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased 5.4% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in these expenses was primarily due to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 28.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 27.6% in fiscal 2013. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, de leveraged in the following categories as a result of the decrease in comparable store sales, as compared to the fiscal 2013:Increased store occupancy costs (approximately 0.9% of net sales).Increased store payroll costs (approximately 0.3% of net sales).These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following:Lower incentive compensation expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.Decreased advertising costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). We continued to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising through changes in the timing, number of pages, and type of merchandise included in our promotional materials, which resulted in a decrease in overall advertising spending, as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.RestructuringIn the second half of fiscal 2014, the Company implemented a series of restructuring initiatives, including closing 377 underperforming stores across the chain and optimized our workforce through a headcount reduction. The $78.2 million charge included in Restructuring consists primarily of future lease obligations and property and equipment impairments related to the store closures and termination benefits associated with the workforce optimization. Merger FeesOn July 27, 2014, we entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of which a subsidiary of Dollar Tree will be merged with and into Family Dollar, with Family Dollar continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Dollar Tree. In executing the Dollar Tree merger agreement, the Company incurred $9.4 million of professional fees during fiscal 2014, consisting primarily of financial advisory and legal costs. Investment Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income The changes in investment income, interest expense and other income in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013 were not material.Income Taxes33 The effective tax rate was 32.7% for fiscal 2014, as compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2013. The effective tax rate was lower primarily due to tax benefits associated with federal jobs tax credits, foreign tax benefits associated with global sourcing, and favorable changes in the reserves for uncertain tax positions.Comparison of Fiscal 2013 to Fiscal 2012 Net Sales Net sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. Consistent with the National Retail Federation Calendar, fiscal 2013 included an extra week, which accounted for approximately $189 million in net sales, or approximately 2.0% of the net sales increase. Additionally, the net sales increase in fiscal 2013 reflects an increase in comparable store sales and new stores opened as part of our store growth program. Comparable store sales increased 3.0% in the fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, as a result of an increase in both customer transactions in comparable stores and average customer transaction values. During fiscal 2013, the number of customer transactions increased approximately 1.7%, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1.3%, as compared to fiscal 2012. Sales during fiscal 2013, on a comparable store basis, were strongest in the Consumables category. The average number of stores in operation during fiscal 2013 was 6.7% higher than the average number of stores in operation during fiscal 2012. We had 7,916 stores in operation at the end of fiscal 2013, as compared to 7,442 stores in operation at the end of fiscal 2012. As of August 31, 2013, we had, in the aggregate, approximately 56.8 million square feet of selling space, as compared to 53.2 million square feet as of August 25, 2012.Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased 12.6% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to additional sales volume. Included in Cost of sales for fiscal 2013 was a $5.0 million favorable accounting adjustment related to certain vendor allowances. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was 65.8% in fiscal 2013, as compared to 65.1% in fiscal 2012. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, was negatively impacted by the following:A shift in sales mix to lower margin consumable merchandise. An increase in lower margin Consumables, as well as softness in sales of Discretionary items, pressured cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. An increase in inventory shrinkage. While our inventory levels were lower on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, the average inventory balance in our stores was higher throughout fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. Inventory shrinkage increased during fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due in part to increased average inventory levels throughout fiscal 2013.An increase in markdowns. In a challenging macro economic environment, we used markdowns to drive revenue growth as we refined our assortment of Consumables merchandise. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the following: An increase in markups on merchandise sales. We focused on improving our purchase markups through better price management, expanded our global sourcing efforts, and developed our private brand assortment, which resulted in higher gross profit margin.A decrease in freight expense. The decrease in freight expense was impacted by our relationship with McLane, which began in September 2012 and resulted in less merchandise being handled through our own distribution network.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 10.9% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in these expenses was due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 27.6% in fiscal 2013, as compared to 27.7% in fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were leveraged as a result of the following, as compared to fiscal 2012:Decreased non store payroll costs, including incentive compensation expense (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Reflecting our pay for performance philosophy, incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. 34This favorable item was partially offset by the following:Increased store occupancy costs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). Rent expense increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily driven by the additional rental expense on the 532 stores sold pursuant to sale leaseback transactions in the second half of fiscal 2012 and in fiscal 2013. Litigation Charge During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an $11.5 million litigation charge associated with the preliminary settlement of a lawsuit in the state of New York. This lawsuit involved claims for overtime pay from New York store managers who worked in our stores. Investment Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income The changes in investment income, interest expense and other income in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 were not material.Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 35.8% for fiscal 2013, as compared to 36.4% for fiscal 2012. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the reserve for state taxes and an increase in the benefit of federal tax credits, partially offset by an increase in the reserves for uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGeneralWe have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. During fiscal 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.2 million from the end of fiscal 2013, and our operating cash flows were $469.2 million. We believe our operating cash flows, proceeds from sale leaseback transactions, and credit facilities are sufficient to fund our regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, share repurchases, cash dividend payments, and principal and interest payments. We have availability under our two credit facilities to borrow up to $900 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for our insurance programs of $18.7 million as of August 30, 2014, to supplement operating cash flows. During fiscal 2014, to help supplement our operating cash flows and to support our growth initiatives, we had an average daily outstanding balance of $214.8 million on our unsecured revolving credit facilities. As of August 30, 2014, we had no short term borrowings outstanding under these facilities. Working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 was $973.0 million, as compared to $776.8 million at the end of fiscal 2013. We believe operating cash flows and capacity under existing credit facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives.Restricted Cash and InvestmentsWe have restricted a portion of cash and investments to serve as collateral for certain of our insurance obligations held at our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These restricted funds cannot be withdrawn from the Companys account without the consent of the secured party. As of August 30, 2014, the Company held $34.4 million in this restricted account, of which $31.4 million was included in Restricted Cash and Investments and $3.0 million was included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 31, 2013, we held $55.5 million in this restricted account, of which $35.4 million was included in Restricted Cash and Investments and $20.1 million was included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The classification between current and non current is based on the timing of expected payments of the secured insurance obligations. The decrease in restricted cash and investments, as compared to fiscal 2013, is attributable to a reduction in the required collateralization amount related to workers compensation insurance claims. Build to Suit and Sale Leaseback TransactionsThe Company uses build to suit and sale leaseback transactions to construct and lease new stores. In a build to suit transaction, an unrelated third party funds the new store construction and owns the property throughout and upon completion of construction. In a sale leaseback transaction, the Company funds the new store construction and owns the property throughout and upon completion of construction. Upon completion of the stores construction in build to suit transactions and concurrent with the sale of stores in sale leaseback transactions, the Company enters into agreements to lease the properties over an initial 35term of 15 years, with four, 5 year fixed renewal options. The Company evaluates each store individually upon certain events during the life of the lease, including individual renewal options. The Company classifies these leases as operating leases, actively uses the leased properties, and considers the leases as normal sale leasebacks. During fiscal 2014, the Company completed 356 build to suit transactions to support new store growth. Additionally, the Company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold 159 stores to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of approximately $194.8 million during fiscal 2014. Upon closing of the transactions, the Company realized a gain on the sale of the stores of $28.4 million, of which $1.1 million was recognized immediately and approximately $27.3 million was deferred and will amortize over the initial lease terms. During fiscal 2013, the Company completed 230 build to suit transactions. Additionally, the Company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold 256 stores and 29 parcels of land to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of approximately $345.2 million. Upon closing of the transactions, the Company realized a gain on the sale of the stores of $84.7 million, of which approximately $2.4 million was recognized immediately and approximately $82.3 million was deferred and will amortize over the initial lease terms. Credit Facilities On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $600 million. The credit facility matures on November 13, 2018, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into a four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to $300 million. The credit facility matures on November 13, 2017, and provides for two, one year extensions that require lender consent. Any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates. The revolving credit facilities provide the Company the capacity to borrow up to $900 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for its insurance program of $18.7 million as of August 30, 2014. The prior unsecured revolving credit facilities provided the Company the capacity to borrow up to $700 million, less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for its insurance program of $18.8 million as of August 31, 2013.The Company had no short term borrowings outstanding under its unsecured revolving credit facilities as of August 30, 2014, or as of August 31, 2013. During fiscal 2014, the Company had no net borrowings and had an average daily outstanding balance of $214.8 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.4% under its unsecured revolving credit facilities. This compares to net repayments of $15.0 million and an average daily outstanding balance of $141.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.5% under the Companys unsecured revolving credit facilities during fiscal 2013. The Companys unsecured revolving credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. Long Term DebtOn January 28, 2011, the Company issued $300 million of 5.00% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2021 (the "2021 Notes"), through a public offering. The Companys proceeds were approximately $298.5 million, net of an issuance discount of $1.5 million. In addition, the Company incurred issuance costs of approximately $3.3 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2011. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness. The Company may redeem the 2021 Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, subject to a make whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, the Company may be required to repurchase the 2021 Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained $250 million through a private placement of unsecured senior notes due September 27, 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), to a group of institutional accredited investors. The 2015 Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Companys other unsecured senior indebtedness. The first 36tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27, 2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on September 27, 2015, with amortization which commenced on September 27, 2011, and bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The second tranche had a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27, 2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27, 2015. The Company has made all required principal payments from September 2011 through September 2014. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 27 and September 27 of each year. The 2015 Notes contain certain restrictive financial covenants, which include a consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. As of August 30, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.Other ConsiderationsDuring the second half of fiscal 2014, we implemented strategic restructuring initiatives, which are expected to result in annualized operating profit benefit of $40 million to $45 million. The operating profit benefits began to be realized in fiscal 2014 and consisted primarily of reduced labor expense related to the headcount reductions and operating profit benefits associated with the closed stores. We expect to continue to incur cash outlays associated with the lease obligations pursuant to the contractual obligations of the leases. The lease obligations for the stores closed as part of the restructuring initiatives are included in the aggregate minimum annual rental under operating leases as discussed below.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company entered into the Dollar Tree merger agreement, under which Dollar Tree will acquire Family Dollar in a cash and stock transaction. In conjunction with the Dollar Tree merger agreement, the Company incurred $9.4 million of professional fees during fiscal 2014, consisting primarily of financial advisory and legal costs. In fiscal 2015, the Company estimates it will incur between $45 million and $55 million of additional professional fees related to the pending merger. Our inventory per store increased 8.0%, as compared to the end of fiscal 2013, primarily driven by the accelerated receipt of shipments and in transit inventory for holiday merchandise. Total merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal 2014 increased 9.7%, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to both the accelerated receipt of shipments and the new stores opened during fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 were $436.3 million, as compared to $744.4 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to a shift to build to suit transactions from sale leaseback transactions in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, and the completion of construction for the eleventh distribution center in fiscal 2013. A summary of spending in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is as follows: 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended(in thousands) August 30, 2014 August 31, 2013New stores $148,947 $385,191Store renovations 141,400 149,120Existing stores 72,858 52,972Supply chain 31,006 76,002Corporate and technology investments 42,077 81,143Total capital expenditures $436,288 $744,428The total number of stores open at year end increased 1.6% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. However, the average store count increased 5.4% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. The total number of stores at year end increased 6.4% in fiscal 2013 and the average store count increased 6.7% in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. The average store count is calculated as rolling 13 month average using the ending store count per fiscal month. A summary of store information is as follows:37 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Store count beginning of year 7,916 7,442 7,023New stores 526 500 475Closed stores 400 26 56Store count end of year 8,042 7,916 7,442 Total relocated, expanded, and renovated stores 738 830 854Total selling square feet (in thousands) 58,112 56,846 53,207Average store count 8,095 7,680 7,197During fiscal 2014, the Company purchased a total of 1.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $125.0 million. All shares were purchased pursuant to share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors. As of August 30, 2014, the Company had $245.8 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased have been and will continue to be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase programs do not have a stated expiration date, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions, or other structured transactions.In addition to the Restricted Cash and Investments noted above, our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary maintains unrestricted balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities used in connection with our retained workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability risks and are not designated for general corporate purposes. As of August 30, 2014, these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were $4.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively.Additionally, during fiscal 2014, we continued to develop our global sourcing teams in Europe and Asia, by enhancing our integration processes, and expanding our supplier network. As of August 30, 2014, we had $42.5 million of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign entities. We are not dependent on dividends from our foreign entities to fund our domestic operations. Unremitted earnings from foreign entities, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, would become subject to U.S. income taxes if they were remitted as dividends or were lent to a domestic entity. Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2014, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $469.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $472.0 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was due primarily to changes in merchandise inventories, prepayments and other current assets, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, all in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we incurred non cash charges for restructuring activities, including an impairment on property and equipment, lease obligations on closed stores, and fees related to our pending merger with Dollar Tree. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on these activities.During fiscal 2013, we had net cash provided by operating activities of $472.0 million, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $369.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to a reduction in payments for merchandise inventories in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, which was offset partially by changes in prepayments and other current assets and income taxes, all in the ordinary course of business. Cash Flows From Investing Activities During fiscal 2014, we had net cash used in investing activities of $200.0 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $314.6 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in capital expenditures and net proceeds from sale leaseback transactions, which are included in the other considerations discussion above. During fiscal 2013, we had net cash used in investing activities of $314.6 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $198.3 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures as a result of opening new stores under our sale leaseback program, offset partially by net changes in restricted cash and investments and investment securities. Cash Flows From Financing Activities38 During fiscal 2014, we had net cash used in financing activities of $270.3 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities $108.7 million during fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.During fiscal 2013, we had net cash used in financing activities of $108.7 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $220.1 million during fiscal 2012. We purchased $75.0 million of our common stock during fiscal 2013 as compared to $191.6 million in fiscal 2012, a decrease in share repurchases of $116.6 million. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2014. Merchandise letters of credit represent obligations due within the next year to suppliers for merchandise the Company has agreed to purchase. Construction obligations relate primarily to amounts due to developers for new store construction projects, which have yet to be completed. Minimum royalty payments are related to an exclusive agreement to sell certain branded merchandise.

At this time, we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities, except for $4.8 million, which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next 12 months. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our tax liabilities.The following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal 2014. (in thousands) Total AmountsCommittedStandby letters of credit $48,695Surety bonds 49,256Total $97,951A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit, which are primarily renewed on an annual basis, is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier. We accrue for these future payment liabilities as described in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this discussion.We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which we may choose to cancel. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation.Pending Merger CommitmentsThe Dollar Tree merger agreement contains provisions that in the event of termination of the Dollar Tree merger agreement, Family Dollar may be required to pay to Dollar Tree its out of pocket expenses, not to exceed $90 million, if the merger agreement is terminated by either Dollar Tree or Family Dollar because Family Dollar fails to obtain the required stockholder approval at the Family Dollar stockholders meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed). In addition, Family Dollar may be required to pay a termination fee of $305 million, less any payment paid in respect of Dollar Trees out of pocket expenses, 39under certain circumstances, including a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of Family Dollar or termination of the Dollar Tree merger agreement by Family Dollar to enter into an agreement for a "Company Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Dollar Tree merger agreement). As of August 30, 2014, no amount has been recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements related to these provisions. Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases included in the "Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments" section above. Our operating lease obligations are primarily related to payments due under noncancelable store leases. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014 09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014 09"). The ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014 09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014 09 is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014 09 during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact of this ASU on the Consolidated Financial Statements.In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service issued updated tax regulations for the Deduction and Capitalization of Expenditures Related to Tangible Property. The regulations can be adopted early; however, the mandatory effective date for the Company is the first quarter of fiscal 2015. These regulations provide additional guidance related to the capitalization and expensing of fixed assets, repairs, and other expenditure types related to the updated tax regulations. Based upon the Companys analysis, the regulations are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013 11 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists ("ASU 2013 11"). The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company will adopt ASU 2013 11 during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013 02 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2013 02"). ASU 2013 02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. The ASU was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting PoliciesOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.We believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.Merchandise Inventories:Our inventories are valued using the retail method, based on retail prices less markup percentages, which approximates the lower of first in, first out (FIFO) cost or market. We record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions, or markdowns, are taken against on hand inventory. In addition, we make estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups, markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions, all of 40which can significantly impact inventory valuation. These estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period. While we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components, if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections, it is possible actual results could differ from recorded estimates. This risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise. We estimate inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory (inventory shrinkage) for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was $79.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $77.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2013. The accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts. Stores receive a physical inventory at least annually. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal 2014. As a result of the strategic initiative to close 377 underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014, an additional $11.9 million of markdowns were incurred to sell through inventory at these stores. Additionally, an adjustment to shrink expense was made to Cost of sales for any inventory balance remaining on the books and records after the stores were closed. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities.Property and Equipment:We state property and equipment at cost. We calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease (generally between five and fifteen years), including reasonably assured renewal options, or the assets useful economic life. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The increase in gross property and equipment, before depreciation, is not commensurate with capital expenditures as a result of the impairment recorded for 377 underperforming stores closed as part of the Companys strategic initiatives in fiscal 2014 and as a result of the significant amount of assets sold during the year under sale leaseback transactions. We generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As a result of the strategic initiative to close underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014, an impairment of $19.9 million on property and equipment was recorded in fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on property and equipment.Insurance Liabilities:We are primarily self insured for health care, property loss, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large number of retail locations and employees. Our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not discounted. We review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates. We also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical, workers compensation, general liability, and auto liability claims. The insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense, sales, number of vehicles, and the frequency and severity of claims. The estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or if the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense, which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations.We record our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis, and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Our total liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs were $224.9 million ($52.6 million current and $172.3 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $232.1 million ($52.2 million current and $179.9 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2013. The current portion of the liabilities is included in Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Liabilities. The insurance assets related to these amounts totaled $29.7 million ($2.1 million current and $27.6 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $31.7 million ($2.5 million current and $29.2 million non current) as of the end of fiscal 2013. The current portion of the assets is included in Prepayments and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the non current portion is included in Other Assets. There were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013. Our insurance 41expense during fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation, general liability and auto liability costs. Contingent Income Tax Liabilities:We are subject to routine income tax audits in the normal course of business, and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various taxing authorities, as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were $24.7 million as of the end of fiscal 2014 and $30.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2013. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal 2014. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities.Contingent Legal Liabilities:We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. We review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. We re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our total legal liabilities were not material as of the end of fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal 2014. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities.Liabilities for Closed Stores:From time to time, we vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the present value of our future lease payments and related costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease terms, net of expected future sublease rental income. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate disposition experts; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using our incremental borrowing interest rates that coincide with the remaining lease terms. As of August 30, 2014, we recorded a liability of $43.7 million related to the strategic initiative to close 377 underperforming stores during the second half of fiscal 2014. Of this liability, $13.3 million was included in Accrued liabilities and $30.4 million was included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on restructuring activities.Stock based Compensation Expense:We measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. The determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a Black Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price, as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued, which is dependent upon the Companys performance relative to a peer group. If factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period. Our results for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 include stock based compensation expense of $15.4 million, $16.3 million, and $15.9 million, respectively. There were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal 2014. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on stock based compensation.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings under our credit facility. As of August 30, 422014, the analysis indicated such a movement would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we incurred an immaterial amount of interest expense related to our credit facilities. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our credit facilities.43
