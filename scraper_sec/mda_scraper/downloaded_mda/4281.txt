ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. Overview We are a leading provider of IT infrastructure, applications development and business process outsourcing services to corporate and government clients around the world. This section provides an overview of the principal factors and events that impacted our 2006 financial results and may impact our future financial results. Results. We reported revenues of $21.3 billion in 2006, an increase of 8% over 2005 revenues of $19.8 billion. Revenues in 2006 increased 7% on an organic basis which excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures. Income from continuing operations increased $213 million in 2006 to $499 million compared with $286 million in 2005. Net income increased $320 million in 2006 to $470 million compared with $150 million in 2005. The improvement in our results in 2006 is primarily due to the success of our initiatives outlined at the beginning of the year to achieve profitable growth through continued focus on cost competitiveness and service quality. Refer to Results of Operations below for additional information about our results for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Investments in Infrastructure and Workforce Alignment. We continued to invest significant amounts in our infrastructure and workforce alignment initiatives in 2006. These investments represented approximately $0.80 per share of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately $0.44 per share during the year ended December 31, 2005. The principal focus of our infrastructure investments in 2006 continued to be the development of our Agile Enterprise platform, a network based utility architecture designed to create a flexible, open and cost effective technology foundation for the delivery of a significant portion of our IT outsourcing and BPO services, and investments in automation and monitoring tools and products to improve productivity. This initiative includes investments to drive standardization and automation in our service delivery platforms. We migrated certain large clients to our new service delivery platforms in 2006 and expect to migrate additional clients in 2007. Our infrastructure investments also included the build out of our global services network, which was substantially completed in 2006. Our infrastructure investments represented approximately $0.46 per share of expenses in 2006. Our workforce alignment investments are focused on increasing our capabilities in lower cost, Best ShoreSM geographies, including India, Latin America, Hungary and China. These investments, which were principally comprised of severance payments, reflected the reduction in force of approximately 5,000 employees in higher cost geographies in 2006. We more than doubled the number of employees in Best ShoreSM locations in 2006 from approximately 14,000 to 32,000 persons, including approximately 18,000 in India. Our Indian workforce includes approximately 13,000 employees of MphasiS Limited (MphasiS). We acquired a majority equity interest in MphasiS in June 2006. Our initiatives to increase capabilities in Best ShoreSM locations also include the transfer of certain internal administrative functions, which are a principal component of our efforts to reduce our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of revenue while allowing for additional focus on sales resources. Our labor cost management initiatives in 2006 also benefited from increased productivity and our investments in automation and monitoring described above. These investments in workforce alignment represented approximately $0.34 per share of expenses in 2006. Total Contract Value of New Contract Signings. A significant portion of our revenue is generated by long term IT services contracts. Accordingly, the total contract value, or TCV, of new business signings is a key metric used by management to monitor new business activity. We refer you to the discussion of our calculation of TCV under the heading Non GAAP Financial Measures below. The TCV of our new contract signings in 2006 was approximately $26.5 billion, compared to approximately $20.1 billion and $14.0 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase for 2006 was driven by the $3.6 billion TCV related to our new contract with GM and the $3.9 billion TCV related to the extension of our NMCI contract, each discussed below. It also reflects an increase in new logos as a percentage of overall TCV in 2006 compared to 2005. See 2007 Priorities and Expectations below for our expectations regarding the TCV of new contract signings in 2007. 14 Following is a quarterly summary of the TCV of contract signings (excluding contracts related to discontinued operations), for each of the last five years (in billions): First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Year 2002 $ 6.7 $ 5.6 $ 2.6 $ 7.6 $ 22.5 2003 2.6 3.0 3.1 3.9 12.6 2004 3.6 3.8 2.9 3.7 14.0 2005 6.9 2.6 5.3 5.3 20.1 2006 10.0 5.4 3.5 7.6 26.5 The TCV of contract signings can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on a number of factors, including the number and timing of significant new and renewal contracts (sometimes referred to as mega deals) and the length of those contracts. Acquisition of Majority Equity Interest in MphasiS. In June 2006, we acquired a majority interest (approximately 51%) in MphasiS, an applications and business process outsourcing services company based in Bangalore, India. The cash purchase price of the controlling interest, net of cash acquired, was $352 million. The acquisition of MphasiS enhances our delivery capabilities in priority growth areas of applications development and business process outsourcing services. We refer you to Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the acquisition of MphasiS, the MphasiS board of directors and the board of directors of our wholly owned Indian subsidiary approved the merger of that subsidiary into MphasiS, pending applicable approvals. If approved, the merger will enable us to consolidate our operations in India. The operational integration of the two entities is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007. The proposal is subject to approval of the stock exchanges in India, shareholders of both companies and court approval. Based on an independent valuation of the two entities, the merger would result in increasing our stake in MphasiS to approximately 62% from approximately 51% at present. In October 2006, we announced an open offer to acquire additional MphasiS common shares, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2007. However, because the offer price is lower than the current trading price for such shares, we do not expect to acquire a significant number of additional shares pursuant to this offer. General Motors Recompete. GM is our largest single client. Our 10 year Master Service Agreement, or MSA, with GM expired in June 2006. The MSA served as a framework for the negotiation and operation of service agreements representing a substantial majority of our revenues from GM. Following a recompete process, in February 2006 we were awarded approximately 70% of the contracts we bid on with a total contract value then estimated at approximately $3.6 billion over five years. Revenues from GM, which include revenues under the MSA through June 7, 2006, were approximately $1.7 billion, or 8% of our total revenues, in 2006. We expect annualized revenue from GM of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion over the remaining term of the new agreement, including the business awarded in the recompete and additional business not part of the recompete. Due to improvements in our cost structure already achieved and expected to be achieved in part through the implementation of our multi year plan, we do not expect a significant change over the term of the new agreement in our operating margins attributable to this client compared to recent historical results. NMCI Contract. We provide end to end IT infrastructure on a seat management basis to the Department of Navy (the DoN), which includes the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, under a contract that has been extended through September 2010. Prior to 2006, this contract had a significant adverse impact on our operating results. In 2003, we incurred operating losses of $389 million, excluding a deferred contract cost write off of $559 million, and reported free cash flow usage of $824 million associated with this contract. In 2004, we incurred operating losses of $487 million, exclusive of a $375 million non cash impairment charge to write down long lived assets to estimated fair value, and reported free cash flow usage of $423 million (excluding the $522 million cash payment for the purchase of financial assets associated with a securitization facility referred to below) associated with this contract. In 2005, we incurred operating losses of $75 million and reported free cash flow of $125 million associated with this contract. On March 24, 2006, we entered into a contract modification with the DoN pursuant to which the DoN exercised its option to extend this contract by three years through September 2010. The contract was also amended to, among other things, incorporate pricing for legacy support, restructure client satisfaction incentive methods to allow for objective metrics, extend the refresh period for a majority of desktop seats, establish the economic lives and valuation methodology for equipment and related infrastructure payable in the event of the DoNs election to purchase such equipment at contract termination, increase the DoNs minimum purchase requirements by an aggregate of $500 million over program years 2006 through 2010, provide for the payment to EDS of $100 million in cash (which was received in the second quarter of 2006), and provide for the release by EDS of certain claims related to the contract. The $100 million cash payment was allocated to future services and will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the contract. As a result of the contract modification, in compliance with Emerging 15 Issues Task Force 01 8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, we recognized sales type capital lease revenue of $116 million in the first quarter of 2006 associated with certain assets previously accounted for as operating leases, and certain assets previously accounted for as capital leases with an aggregate net investment balance of $113 million are now accounted for as operating leases based on revised estimates of economic lives as agreed in the contract modification (20 years). We expect to recover a significant portion of our investment in this contract through the sale of NMCI infrastructure and desktop assets to the client at the end of the contract term, including amounts in excess of the expected carrying amounts of contract assets. Long lived assets and lease receivables associated with the contract totaled approximately $278 million and $295 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. As a result of the activity on the contract during the first quarter of 2006, including the sales type capital lease revenue resulting from the contract modification, we recognized net non recurring income of $0.02 per share during the first quarter. Operating profit for the contract during 2006 improved significantly over prior years as a result of higher levels of seat deployment and service delivery improvements. As part of the March 24, 2006 contract modification, we also became eligible to be compensated for certain communications costs when required to supplement the Government communications network, and we received orders of $40 million from the DoN related to the fourth quarter of 2005 through the third quarter of 2006. This amount is included in revenues in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. U.K. Ministry of Defence Contract. In March 2005, a consortium led by us was awarded a 10 year contract for the first increment of the U.K. Ministry of Defence (MoD) project to consolidate numerous existing information networks into a single next generation infrastructure (the Defence Information Infrastructure Future project). The total contract value of the initial contract was approximately $3.9 billion over 10 years. In December 2006, the contract was amended to include the second increment of such project, increasing the total contract value by approximately $1.27 billion over the remaining eight years of the contract. Our upfront expenditure and capital investment requirements for this contract have adversely impacted our free cash flow and earnings during certain fiscal periods since inception of the contract and may continue to do so in the future. Many of the services and service delivery challenges required by this contract are similar to those required by the NMCI contract discussed above, and accordingly, many of the risks are the same. We have applied lessons learned from our experience with the NMCI contract to this contract, including contract terms with clearly defined client and EDS accountability and improved program management. There have occurred and may occur in the future program changes and inabilities to achieve certain related dependencies that extend the initial development timeline. This contract provides for adjustments to be made to reflect the financial impact to EDS of certain program changes and any inability to achieve dependencies. During 2006, we reached a mutually satisfactory agreement with the client regarding some initial billing adjustments under the contract to reflect part of the financial impact to us of an extended initial development timeline. We will continue in the ongoing course of this contract to work with the client to agree upon any future appropriate adjustments under the contract which may be necessary. If we are unable to reach agreement with the client regarding such adjustments, our revenues, earnings and free cash flow for this contract, or the timing of the recognition thereof, could be adversely impacted. Verizon. We provided IT services to MCI, Inc. pursuant to an IT services agreement that included minimum annual purchase obligations through January 2008. We also procured network telecommunications services from MCI pursuant to an agreement that included minimum annual purchase obligations through 2010. MCI was acquired by Verizon Communications, Inc. in January 2006. In December 2006, Verizon in sourced most of the IT services we had been providing to MCI. We received a $90 million payment from Verizon in the fourth quarter of 2006 for assets and transition services. We also received a payment of $225 million in the first quarter of 2007 related to the termination of these services. As a result of this payment and certain services we will continue to provide and bill for in 2007, we do not expect that our free cash flow or income for this contract for the 2007 fiscal year will be significantly different from the results we would have experienced had the contract continued unchanged through January 2008. However, we do not expect to recognize any significant revenue or earnings from this client after 2007. Although the $225 million payment will be reflected in our first quarter 2007 free cash flow, the payment is expected to be reflected in our revenue and earnings for the first and third quarters of 2007 due to certain contingencies in our agreement with this client. In addition to the changes to our IT services agreement, the agreement pursuant to which we procure telecommunications network services was also amended to, among other things, reduce our minimum annual spend commitment by approximately 50% and provide additional flexibility in our ability to meet that commitment. Divestiture of Global Field Services. On November 15, 2006, we completed the sale of Global Field Services, our desktop support services business located in Europe. As a result of this disposition, we incurred a pre tax loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 of $23 million. Divestiture of A. T. Kearney. We completed the sale of our A.T. Kearney management consulting subsidiary to the firms management effective January 20, 2006. That subsidiary is classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005 and its results are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations. A.T. Kearneys results for the year ended December 31, 2005 include a pre tax impairment charge of $118 million to write down the carrying value of its long lived assets, including tradename intangible, to estimated fair value less cost to sell. The estimated fair value was determined based on the terms of the sale. The impairment charge was partially offset by the recognition of $8 million previously unrecognized tax assets that were expected to 16 be realized as a result of the sale. Income (loss) from discontinued operations also includes the net results of the maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) management services business which was transferred by A.T. Kearney to us prior to the divestiture of A.T. Kearney in January 2006. We refer you to Note 17 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Share Count. The weighted average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share were 519 million and 529 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. On February 21, 2006, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program over 18 months. Through December 31, 2006, we had purchased 26.2 million shares at a cost of $683 million under this repurchase program, including the shares purchased under a $400 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement entered into in February 2006 (see Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our share count reflects the share repurchases referred to above, as well as shares issued under our employee stock based compensation programs. Factors that could affect basic and dilutive share counts in the future include the share price and additional repurchases of shares under the authorization referred to above, offset by the dilutive effects of all our employee stock based compensation plans and our contingently convertible senior notes. We are evaluating a share neutral approach, the objective of which would be to repurchase sufficient additional shares to approximately offset the dilutive effects of our employee stock based compensation plans. Assuming we adopt such an approach, we expect the weighted average number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share to be approximately 545 million shares (which includes the dilutive impact of our contingently convertible senior notes). Accounting change. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158 in 2006. We refer you to Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about this accounting change. 2007 Priorities and Expectations In 2007, we will continue our initiatives to achieve profitable growth through focus on cost competitiveness and service quality. We expect to show continued improvement in our financial results as we benefit from our prior investments in infrastructure and workforce realignment, a reduction in the level of those investments compared to 2006 and our initiatives to further improve productivity and performance at the account level, leverage service delivery and reduce selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. In addition, we will continue our focus on improving service quality, client satisfaction and client innovation. We currently expect 2007 revenues of approximately $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion, which would represent an increase in organic revenues of approximately 4% from 2006, driven principally by the increased level of contract signings in 2006. We currently expect 2007 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.60, which excludes the impact of discontinued operations, gains and losses from divestitures, reversals of previously recognized restructuring expense and other identified items that management believes are not reflective of our core operating business. We refer you to the discussion of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share under Non GAAP Financial Measures below. The expected increase in 2007 adjusted earnings per share reflects an anticipated improvement in operating margins. We currently expect to generate free cash flow of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion in 2007, an improvement from 2006 driven principally by the forecasted improvement in our operating margins. Refer to Non GAAP Financial Measures below for a definition and discussion of free cash flow. We currently expect the TCV of new contract signings in 2007 to be approximately $23 billion. We refer you to the discussion of the calculation of TCV under the heading Non GAAP Financial Measures below. The estimates for 2007 financial performance set forth in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations rely on managements current assumptions, including assumptions concerning future events, and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the control of management, that could cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates. For a discussion of certain of these factors, we refer you to the discussion under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Non GAAP Financial Measures In addition to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, results, we disclose the non GAAP measures of adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share exclude the impact of certain special amounts, specifically earnings/losses from discontinued operations net of taxes, gains and losses from divestitures, reversals of previously recognized restructuring expense and other identified items that management believes are not reflective of our core operating business. Such amounts may have a material impact on our net income and 17 earnings per share. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is the sum of (i) net cash used in investing activities, excluding proceeds from sales of marketable securities, proceeds related to divested assets and non marketable equity investments, payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and non marketable equity investments, and payments for purchases of marketable securities, and (ii) payments on capital leases. Free cash flow excludes items that are actual expenditures that impact cash available to EDS for other uses and should not be considered a measure of liquidity or an alternative to the cash flow measurements required by GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities or net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a reconciliation of free cash flow to the net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Management considers these non GAAP measures an important measure of EDS performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate EDS core operating performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in EDS business and establish operational goals and forecasts, including targets for performance based compensation. EDS may not define adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share or free cash flow in the same manner as other companies and, accordingly, the amounts reported by EDS for such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We also disclose the total contract value, or TCV, of new business signings. Management considers TCV to be an important metric to monitor new business activity. There are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of TCV. The TCV of a client contract represents our estimate at contract signing of the total revenue expected over the term of that contract. Contract signings include contracts with new clients and renewals, extensions and add on business with existing clients. TCV does not include potential revenues that could be earned from a client relationship as a result of future expansion of service offerings to that client, nor does it reflect option years under non governmental contracts that are subject to client discretion. TCV reflects a number of management estimates and judgments regarding the contract, including assumptions regarding demand driven usage, scope of work and client requirements. In addition, our contracts may be subject to currency fluctuations and, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity characteristics. Accordingly, the TCV we report should not be considered firm orders or predictive of future operating results. Non GAAP measures are a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. To gain a complete picture of our performance, management does (and investors should) rely on our GAAP financial statements. Results of Operations Revenues. As reported growth percentages are calculated using revenues reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Organic growth percentages are calculated by removing from current year as reported revenues the impact of the change in exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar from the current period and the comparable prior period. It further excludes revenue growth due to acquisitions in the period presented if the comparable prior period had no revenue from the same acquisition, and revenue decreases due to businesses divested in the period presented or the comparable prior period. Segment revenues for non U.S. operations are measured using fixed currency exchange rates. Differences between the fixed and actual exchange rates are included in the all other category. Following is a summary of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): As Reported Growth % Organic Growth % Consolidated revenues: 2006 2005 Revenues $ 21,268 $ 19,757 8% 7% % Increase (Decrease) Segment revenues: 2006 2005 Americas $ 9,588 $ 9,239 4% EMEA 6,448 5,935 9% Asia Pacific 1,479 1,377 7% U.S. Government 3,350 2,842 18% Other 23 22 Total Outsourcing 20,888 19,415 8% All other 380 342 Total $ 21,268 $ 19,757 8% 18 Revenue growth in the Americas was primarily attributable to contracts with new clients in our retail, energy and transportation industry groups, add on business with existing clients in our financial services industry group and in Latin America, and our ExcellerateHRO business which began operations in March 2005. Americas revenues in 2006 includes the recognition of a $90 million payment for assets and transition services related to the in sourcing of services by Verizon described above. Revenue growth in EMEA was primarily attributable to increased revenues from the U.K. MoD contract and clients in North and South EMEA, partially offset by a decline in revenues from clients in Central EMEA and the U.K. Revenue growth in Asia Pacific was primarily attributable to our acquisition of MphasiS in the second quarter of 2006, partially offset by a decline in revenues from a client in the financial services industry in Australia. Revenue growth in U.S. Government was primarily attributable to the NMCI contract and several state Medicaid contracts, partially offset by the impact of the completion of a large federal contract in 2005. Refer to the Overview section above for a further discussion of the U.K. MoD, NMCI and Verizon contracts and of our acquisition of MphasiS. Following is a summary of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): As Reported Growth % Organic Growth % Consolidated revenues: 2005 2004 Revenues $ 19,757 $ 19,863 (1)% (3)% % Increase (Decrease) Segment revenues: 2005 2004 Americas $ 9,239 $ 9,251 EMEA 5,935 6,247 (5)% Asia Pacific 1,377 1,289 7% U.S. Government 2,842 2,893 (2)% Other 22 24 Total Outsourcing 19,415 19,704 (1)% All other 342 159 Total $ 19,757 $ 19,863 (1)% The decrease in revenues in the Americas was primarily due to the termination of a significant commercial contract in August 2004 (see Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in revenues in EMEA was primarily due to the termination of our contract with the U.K. Governments Inland Revenue department effective June 2004, offset by an increase in revenue from other government and commercial clients, including our contract with the U.K. MoD. Revenue growth in Asia Pacific was primarily due to an increase in revenues from a client in the financial services industry in Australia. The decrease in the U.S. Government was primarily attributable to the completion of a large federal contract in early 2005, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our NMCI contract. Gross margin. Our gross margin percentages [(revenues less cost of revenues)/revenues] were 12.6%, 11.8% and 8.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in our gross margin percentage in 2006 was primarily attributable to our enterprise wide productivity initiatives, including improved performance on significant contracts, better sourcing and other cost structure improvements (240 basis points) and a pension obligation settlement loss associated with the termination of the Inland Revenue contract in 2005 (40 basis points), partially offset by incremental costs related to investments in our infrastructure, new service offerings and severance (190 basis points). Contracts with improved performance in 2006 include, among others, the NMCI contract (140 basis points), which includes the impact of the contract modification discussed above, and the Verizon contract (35 basis points), which includes the impact of the $90 million payment for assets and transition assistance services discussed above. The increase in our gross margin percentage in 2005 was primarily attributable to an improvement in the performance of the NMCI contract which had operating losses of $75 million in 2005 compared with operating losses of $487 million and an asset impairment charge of $375 million in 2004. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The NMCI contract had a 480 basis point negative impact on our 2004 gross margin percentage compared to a 90 basis point negative impact in 2005. Other items affecting our 2005 gross margin include a pension obligation settlement loss associated with the termination of the Inland Revenue contract (40 basis points), an increase in compensation expense attributable to the change in accounting for share based payments (50 basis points), a deferred cost impairment charge associated with a large IT commercial contract (20 basis points) and litigation costs (20 basis points). These items were partially offset by favorable resolution of certain customer contract matters that permitted recognition of previously deferred revenue (40 basis points). Our gross margin in 2005 was also adversely affected by investments in our infrastructure and new service offerings and a decrease in revenues, including the termination of our contract with the U.K. Governments Inland Revenue department. An additional item affecting our 2004 gross margin was operating losses and other charges on our other commercial contract (150 basis points). 19 Selling, general and administrative. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.7%, 9.2% and 7.9% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in our SG&A percentage in 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues (70 basis points) and a decrease in legal costs (20 basis points), including costs associated with the settlement of a consolidated securities action in 2005, partially offset by an increase in selling costs associated with increasing TCV of new business signings (10 basis points). The increase in our SG&A percentage in 2005 was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense resulting from the change in accounting for share based payments, and performance based RSUs (30 basis points) and incremental legal and regulatory costs (20 basis points), including costs associated with the settlement of a consolidated securities action. Our SG&A expense in 2005 was also impacted by higher sales and marketing costs, including commissions associated with increasing TCV of new business signings (40 basis points), and by certain investment initiatives (10 basis points). We expect our operating margin [(revenues less costs and expenses)/revenues] to improve in 2007 driven by the benefits of our key productivity initiatives, the performance of significant contracts and a reduction in the level of spending on our investment initiatives. Other operating (income) expense. Following is a summary of other operating (income) expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Other operating (income) expense: Restructuring costs, net of reversals $(7) $68 $226 Early retirement offer 50 Pre tax loss (gain) on disposal of businesses: Global Field Services 23 European wireless clearing (93 ) U.S. wireless clearing (1 ) (35 ) Automotive Retail Group (66 ) Credit Union Industry Group (4 ) Other (1) (1) Total $ 15 $ (26 ) $ 170 We refer you to Note 19 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the components of other operating (income) expense. Other income (expense). Other income (expense) includes interest expense, interest and dividend income, investment gains and losses, minority interest expense, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Following is a summary of other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Other income (expense): Interest expense $ (239 ) $ (241 ) $ (321 ) Interest income and other, net 179 138 49 Total $ (60 ) $ (103 ) $ (272 ) Interest income and other in 2006 includes net investment gains of $17 million compared to net investment losses of $41 million in 2005, including a write down of $35 million relating to our leveraged lease investments. Interest income and other in 2006 compared with 2005 reflects an increase in interest and dividend income of $22 million, offset by an increase in net foreign currency transaction losses of $24 million. The increase in interest income and other in 2005 was primarily due to interest income on increased levels of cash and marketable securities, and foreign currency transaction gains. Interest income and other in 2004 includes net investment losses of $28 million, including a write down of $34 million relating to our leveraged lease investments. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 was primarily due to the extinguishment of debt resulting from our debt exchange offer completed in 2004 and other scheduled debt repayments. See Financial Position and Liquidity and Capital Resources for a further discussion of our outstanding debt balance. Interest expense in 2004 includes $36 million in expenses resulting from our debt exchange offer. See Note 8 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the exchange offer. Income taxes. Our effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were 34.0%, 34.9% and 27.5% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2006 was impacted by (i) the passage of a new Texas tax system requiring a $19 million write off of net deferred tax assets, (ii) the recognition of additional valuation allowances of $44 million for losses incurred in certain foreign tax jurisdictions due to underperforming operations, and (iii) 20 favorable changes to the liabilities for tax contingencies of $48 million, including settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The effective tax rate in 2005 was impacted by (i) recognition of additional valuation allowances of $115 million for losses incurred in certain foreign tax jurisdictions due to underperforming operations, and (ii) reversal of certain tax contingency accruals of $40 million due to progress made in jurisdictional tax audits. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate periodically as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. As we record expense under SFAS No. 123R, a deferred tax asset is recorded. The realization of that asset is dependent upon the intrinsic value of an option on the date of exercise. Any unrealized deferred tax asset is charged to tax expense in the period of exercise or expiration and, accordingly, would result in a higher effective tax rate in such period. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion of factors affecting income tax expense. In June 2006, we agreed with the IRS on a settlement related to the R&D tax credit for years 1996 2002 and the closure of the audit of our 1996 1998 federal income tax returns. We had previously estimated the amount of the R&D credit that would be disallowed for each year and recorded a tax liability for such amount. Our analysis included the fact that the IRS had proposed disallowances of the entire R&D credit for tax years 1996 1998 and a portion of the R&D credit for tax years 1999 2002. The settlement resulted in a $50 million reduction of such liability in the second quarter of 2006. Discontinued operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations is comprised primarily of the net results of A.T. Kearney which was sold in 2006 and UGS PLM Solutions which was sold in 2005. Refer to Note 17 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to discontinued operations. Segment information. Refer to Note 12 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of certain financial information related to our reportable segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004, as well as certain financial information related to our operations by geographic region and by service line for such years. Financial Position At December 31, 2006, we held cash and marketable securities of $3.0 billion, had working capital of $3.0 billion, and had a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of 1.58 to 1. This compares to cash and marketable securities of $3.2 billion, working capital of $3.5 billion, and a current ratio of 1.68 to 1 at December 31, 2005. Approximately 5% of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006 were not available for debt repayment due to various commercial limitations on the use of these assets. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 56 days at December 31, 2006 compared to 58 days at December 31, 2005. Days payable outstanding were 21 days at December 31, 2006 compared to 19 days at December 31, 2005. Total debt was $3.1 billion at December 31, 2006 versus $3.3 billion at December 31, 2005. Total debt consists of notes payable and capital leases. The total debt to capital ratio (which includes total debt and minority interests as components of capital) was 28% at December 31, 2006 and 30% at December 31, 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations In connection with certain service contracts, we may arrange a client supported financing transaction (CSFT) with our client and an independent third party financial institution or its designee. The use of these transactions enables us to offer clients more favorable financing terms. These transactions also enable the preservation of our capital and allow us to avoid client credit risk relating to the repayment of the financed amounts. Under these transactions, the independent third party financial institution finances the purchase of certain IT related assets and simultaneously leases those assets for use in connection with the service contract. The use of a CSFT on a service contract results in lower contract revenue and expense to EDS over the contract term. In CSFTs, client payments are made directly to the financial institution providing the financing. If the client does not make the required payments under the service contract, under no circumstances do we have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless our nonperformance under the service contract would permit its termination, or we fail to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements, including, for example, covenants we have undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended purpose. We consider the possibility of our failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote. The aggregate dollar values of assets purchased under our CSFT arrangements were $16 million, $8 million and $65 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. No future asset purchases are expected to be financed under existing arrangements. As of December 31, 2006, there were outstanding an aggregate of $136 million under CSFTs yet to be paid by our clients. In the event a client contract is terminated due to nonperformance, we would be required to acquire only those assets associated with the outstanding amounts for that contract. Net of repayments, the estimated future maximum amount outstanding under existing financing arrangements is not expected to exceed $150 million. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of capital to directly finance the purchase of capital assets to be used for our current and future client contracts without the use of these arrangements. 21 Performance guarantees. In the normal course of business, we may provide certain clients, principally governmental entities, with financial performance guarantees, which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, we would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client, the likelihood of which we believe is remote. We believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee. Following is a summary of the estimated expiration of financial guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Estimated Expiration Per Period Total 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Performance guarantees: CSFT transactions $ 136 $ 107 $ 20 $ 7 $ 2 Standby letters of credit, surety bonds and other 574 276 25 14 259 Other guarantees 19 13 6 Total $ 729 $ 396 $ 51 $ 21 $ 261 Contractual obligations. Following is a summary of payments due in specified periods related to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Long term debt, including current portion and interest(1) $ 4,638 $ 336 $ 1,252 $ 979 $ 2,071 Operating lease obligations 1,516 343 517 288 368 Purchase obligations(2) 2,599 1,318 981 298 2 Total(3) $ 8,753 $ 1,997 $ 2,750 $ 1,565 $ 2,441 (1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments (principal and interest) of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts. Amounts also include capital lease payments (principal and interest). (2) Purchase obligations include material agreements to purchase goods or services, principally software and telecommunications services, that are enforceable and legally binding on EDS and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude our obligation to repurchase minority interests in joint ventures, including our obligation to repurchase Towers Perrins minority interest in ExcellerateHRO. See Note 16 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (3) We contributed $240 million and $346 million to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to these plans in 2007, including discretionary and statutory contributions. Our U.S. funding policy is to contribute amounts that fall within the range of deductible contributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our retirement plans. 22 Liquidity and Capital Resources Following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,933 $ 1,296 $ 1,278 Net cash used in investing activities (33 ) (797 ) (758 ) Net cash used in financing activities (834 ) (681 ) (663 ) Free cash flow 887 619 304 Operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to a $48 million increase in cash provided by earnings (i.e., net income less non cash operating items) and a $589 million change in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from an improvement in receivable collections and lower vendor and tax payments, partially offset by an increase in contract costs and vendor prepayments and a decrease in customer prepayments. The change in operating liabilities was also impacted by various severance accruals recognized in 2006 that will be paid in 2007, and certain significant vendor payments in 2005 that had been recognized as expense in 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to a $150 million increase in earnings, adjusted to exclude non cash operating items, offset by a $132 million change in operating assets and liabilities. The change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in receivables collections and an increase in tax payments, offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Investing activities. The change in net cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from sales of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from investments and real estate and an increase in payments for software. Payments for acquisitions relate primarily to the purchases of MphasiS in 2006 and the Towers Perrin pension, health and welfare administration services business in 2005. Refer to Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions. Net proceeds from real estate sales resulted from the sales of real estate properties and land held for development. Refer to Notes 3 and 5 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our real estate sales. The change in net cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from divestitures in 2005, and an increase in acquisition payments related to 2005 acquisitions (see Notes 16, 17 and 19 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, we realized net proceeds of $178 million in 2005 resulting from sales of real estate. Net cash used in investing activities in 2004 includes the proceeds from the divestitures of our U.S. wireless clearing business, UGS PLM Solutions and Automotive Retail Group (ARG). Divestiture proceeds were somewhat offset by net purchases of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2004 also includes a $522 million cash payment related to the purchase of financial assets associated with the NMCI securitization facility. Financing activities. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2006 was primarily due to purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by a reduction in debt payments and an increase in cash provided by employee stock transactions. Refer to the Overview section above and Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our share repurchase authorization. Refer to Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations above for a summary of expected payments related to our outstanding debt at December 31, 2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to proceeds from our common stock issuance associated with a debt exchange in 2004. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations, partially offset by proceeds from our common stock issuance associated with a debt exchange and by a reduction in dividend payments. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures is the sum of (i) net cash used in investing activities, excluding proceeds from sales of marketable securities, proceeds related to divested assets and non marketable equity investments, payments related to acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and non marketable equity investments, and payments for purchases of marketable securities, and (ii) capital lease payments. During 2004, we sold our UGS PLM Solutions subsidiary and repurchased financial assets outstanding under the NMCI contract securitization facility. Due to the significance of these transactions, the calculation of free cash flow for 2004 was adjusted to exclude $14 million in transaction fees paid during 2004 related to the UGS PLM Solutions disposition, and the $522 million cash payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the NMCI securitization facility. The calculation of free cash flow for 2004 was also adjusted to include $85 million in cash generated through utilization of operating tax credits, predominantly related to 2004, to offset income tax associated with the UGS PLM Solutions disposition (such tax credits would otherwise have been available to offset future taxable income generated by operations). Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure and should be viewed together with our consolidated statements of cash flows. 23 Following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,933 $ 1,296 $ 1,278 Capital expenditures: Proceeds from investments and other assets 264 310 68 Net proceeds from real estate sales 49 178 Payments for purchases of property and equipment (729 ) (718 ) (666 ) Payments for investments and other assets (94 ) (27 ) (556 ) Payments for purchases of software and other intangibles (427 ) (300 ) (302 ) Other investing activities 35 29 28 Capital lease payments (144 ) (149 ) (167 ) Total net capital expenditures (1,046 ) (677 ) (1,595 ) Adjustments: Utilization of tax credits related to the UGS PLM Solutions disposition 85 Transaction fees related to the UGS PLM Solutions disposition 14 Payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the NMCI securitization facility 522 Free cash flow 887 619 304 Other investing and financing activities: Proceeds from sales of marketable securities 2,793 1,434 956 Net proceeds (payments) from divested assets and non marketable equity securities (49 ) 160 2,129 Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and non marketable equity securities (361 ) (552 ) (78 ) Payments for purchases of marketable securities (1,514 ) (1,311 ) (2,337 ) Proceeds from long term debt 5 6 Payments on long term debt (213 ) (560 ) (561 ) Proceeds from issuance of common stock 198 Purchase of treasury stock (667 ) Employee stock transactions 285 107 76 Dividends paid (104 ) (105 ) (200 ) Other financing activities 9 21 (15 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 7 (21 ) 48 Adjustments: Utilization of tax credits related to the UGS PLM Solutions disposition (85 ) Transaction fees related to the UGS PLM Solutions disposition (14 ) Payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the NMCI securitization facility (522 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,073 $ (203 ) $ (95 ) Our gross capital requirement was approximately $1.5 billion in 2006, including equipment and real estate leases and the use of CSFTs. We expect net capital expenditures of 5.0% to 5.5% of revenues in 2007, slightly higher than our 5.0% historical average due to the capital requirements associated with recent contract signings. Refer to the Overview section above for our current expectations regarding 2007 free cash flow. 24 Credit facilities. On June 30, 2006, we entered into a $1 billion Five Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a bank group including Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent for the lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. The Credit Agreement replaced our $550 million Three and One Half Year Multi Currency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into in September 2004 and our $450 million Three Year Multi Currency Revolving Credit Agreement entered into in September 2003. The Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate borrowing purposes and issuance of letters of credit, with a $500 million sub limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants which would allow any amounts outstanding thereunder to be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event of our noncompliance. Following is a summary of such covenants and the calculated ratios at December 31, 2006: Covenant Actual Leverage ratio 3.00 1.22 Interest coverage ratio 3.00 10.49 At December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. We anticipate utilizing the Credit Agreement principally for the issuance of letters of credit, including the replacement of letters of credit issued under the replaced facilities which aggregated $171 million at December 31, 2006. The issuance of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement utilizes availability under the Credit Agreement, as was the case with the replaced facilities. Credit ratings. Following is a summary of our senior long term debt credit ratings by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. (Moodys), Standard & Poors Rating Services (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) at February 23, 2007: Moodys S&P Fitch Senior long term debt Ba1 BBB BBB Outlook Positive Stable Positive On February 8, 2007, S&P revised our rating outlook from negative to stable. On November 21, 2006, Fitch revised our rating outlook to positive from stable. On November 14, 2006, Moodys revised our rating outlook to positive from stable. At December 31, 2006, we had no recognized or contingent material liabilities that would be subject to accelerated payment due to a ratings downgrade. We do not believe a negative change in our credit rating would have a material adverse impact on us under the terms of our existing client agreements. Liquidity. At December 31, 2006, we had total liquidity of $3.7 billion, comprised of unrestricted cash and marketable securities of $2.9 billion and availability under our unsecured credit facilities of $829 million. Management currently intends to maintain unrestricted cash and marketable securities in an amount equal to at least 12 months of forecasted capital expenditures (as defined under Free Cash Flow above), interest payments, debt maturities and dividend payments. Change in dividend rate. On July 27, 2004, our Board of Directors reduced the quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.15 to $0.05 per share. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This new standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The new standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years. The provisions of the new standard are to be applied prospectively for most financial instruments and retrospectively for others as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the standard is initially applied. We will be required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of Statement No. 157 and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN 48 and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted SFAS No. 158 in 2006. We refer you to Note 1 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these accounting changes. 25 Application of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant judgments and estimates are used include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounts receivable collectibility, accounting for long lived assets, deferred income taxes, retirement plans, performance guarantees and litigation. Revenue recognition and associated cost deferral. We provide IT and business process outsourcing services under time and material, unit price and fixed price contracts, which may extend up to 10 or more years. Services provided over the term of these arrangements may include one or more of the following: IT infrastructure support and management; IT system and software maintenance; application hosting; the design, development, or construction of software and systems (Construct Service); transaction processing; and business process management. If a contract involves the provision of a single element, revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event. If the service is provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular, revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term. However, if the single service is a Construct Service, revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method using a zero profit methodology. Under this method, costs are deferred until contractual milestones are met, at which time the milestone billing is recognized as revenue and an amount of deferred costs is recognized as expense so that cumulative profit equals zero. If the milestone billing exceeds deferred costs, then the excess is recorded as deferred revenue. When the Construct Service is completed and the final milestone met, all unrecognized costs, milestone billings and profit are recognized in full. If the contract does not contain contractual milestones, costs are expensed as incurred and revenue is recognized in an amount equal to costs incurred until completion of the Construct Service, at which time any profit would be recognized in full. If total costs are estimated to exceed revenue for the Construct Service, then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent. If a contract involves the provision of multiple service elements, total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. The amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future. Revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts, except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non Construct Service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event. If the amount of revenue allocated to a Construct Service is less than its relative fair value, costs to deliver such service equal to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value are deferred and amortized over the contract term. If total Construct Service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the Construct Service contained in a multiple element arrangement, then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent. In the rare event that fair value is not determinable for each service element of a multiple element contract, the contract is considered one accounting unit, and revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method. Under this method, contract revenue is recognized for each service element based on the proportional performance of each service element to the total expected performance of each service element over the life of the contract. We also defer and subsequently amortize certain set up costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to the client. Such activities include the relocation of transitioned employees, the migration of client systems or processes, and the exit of client facilities. Deferred contract costs, including set up costs, are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate. The recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term. If such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs, including contract concessions paid to the client, the deferred contract costs and contract concessions are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency. If a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs and contract concessions to zero, any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment. Any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets. Accounts receivable. Reserves for uncollectible trade receivables are established when collection of amounts due from clients is deemed improbable. Indicators of improbable collection include client bankruptcy, client litigation, industry downturns, 26 client cash flow difficulties or ongoing service or billing disputes. Receivables more than 180 days past due are automatically reserved unless persuasive evidence of probable collection exists. Our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables were 1.9% and 2.0% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Long lived assets. Our property and equipment, software and definite lived intangible asset policies require the amortization or depreciation of assets over their estimated useful lives. An assets useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. The useful lives of property and equipment are limited to the standard depreciable lives or, for certain assets dedicated to client contracts, the related contract term. The useful lives of capitalized software are limited to the shorter of the license period or the related contract term. The estimated useful lives of definite lived intangible assets are based on the expected use of the asset and factors that may limit the use of the asset. We may utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser in the assessment of the useful life of an intangible asset. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units, obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date and compare the estimated fair value of each unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are identified based on a review of our internal reporting structure and are comprised of the components of our operating segments that share similar economic characteristics. The fair value of a reporting unit is the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models. Those models require estimates of future revenues, profits, capital expenditures and working capital for each unit. We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. We utilize our weighted average cost of capital to discount the estimated expected future cash flows of each unit. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment test for 2006 as of December 1, 2006. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in 2006 indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired. We plan to conduct our annual impairment test as of December 1st of each year when our budgets and operating plans for the forthcoming year are expected to be finalized. The timing and frequency of additional goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present. A decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired. This situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the units goodwill is impaired. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. An impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill would become the new cost basis of the units goodwill. Deferred income taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. A majority of the tax assets are associated with tax jurisdictions in which we have a large scale of operations and long history of generating taxable income, thereby reducing the estimation risk associated with recoverability analysis. However, in smaller tax jurisdictions in which we have less historical experience or smaller scale of operations, the assessment of recoverability of tax assets is largely based on projections of taxable income over the expiration period of the tax asset and is subject to greater estimation risk. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible the recoverability of tax assets in these smaller jurisdictions could be impaired as a result of poor operating performance over extended periods of time or a future decision to reduce or eliminate operating activity in such jurisdictions. Such an impairment would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and related tax expense in the period of impairment. Liabilities for tax contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for tax contingencies related to positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result from the uncertainties in application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. Although we believe our reserves for tax contingencies are reasonable, they may change in the future due to new developments with each issue. We record an additional charge or benefit in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is more or less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 27 Retirement plans. We offer pension and other postretirement benefits to our employees through multiple global pension plans. Our largest pension plans are funded through our cash contributions and earnings on plan assets. We use the actuarial models required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, to account for our pension plans. Two of the most significant actuarial assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined pension benefit plans are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate assumptions. SFAS No. 87 requires the use of an expected long term rate of return that, over time, will approximate the actual long term returns earned on pension plan assets. We base this assumption on historical actual returns as well as anticipated future returns based on our investment mix. Given our relatively young workforce, we are able to take a long term view of our pension investment strategy. Accordingly, plan assets are weighted heavily towards equity investments. Equity investments are susceptible to significant short term fluctuations but have historically outperformed most other investment alternatives on a long term basis. At December 31, 2006, 85% of pension assets were invested in public and private equity and real estate investments with the remaining assets being invested in fixed income securities. Such mix is consistent with that assumed in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. Rebalancing our actual asset allocations to our planned allocations based on actual performance has not been a significant issue. An 8.4% and 8.6% weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations in 2006 and 2005, respectively. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in this assumption results in an estimated pension expense decrease or increase, respectively, of $79 million in the subsequent years pension expense (based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant). An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. This rate reflects the underlying rate determined on the measurement date at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled. High quality bond yields on our measurement date, October 31, 2006, with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods are used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption. For the countries with the largest pension plans, actual participant data is used by our actuaries to determine the maturity of the benefit obligation which is matched to bonds available at the measurement date. In other countries, we use the average age of the participants to determine the maturity of the benefit obligation. A 5.4% weighted average discount rate assumption was used for the 2006 pension plan actuarial valuations. The methodology used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption has been consistently applied. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated decrease of approximately $121 million in the subsequent years pension expense, and a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated increase of approximately $221 million in the subsequent years pension expense (based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant). Our long standing policy of making consistent cash pension plan contributions provided some protection against negative short term market returns. In addition, positive investment returns from 2003 to 2006 resulted in our actual pension plan asset returns exceeding expected returns reflected in our assumptions. However, the impact of contributions and positive returns has been offset by declining discount rates in some recent years. Our pension plans funded status, as of October 31, 2006 reflected total plan assets of $7.9 billion and total projected benefit obligations under all plans of $9.4 billion. As a result, under the requirements of SFAS No. 158, we have pension liabilities of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2006 with a corresponding reduction, net of tax, in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity of $684 million. Our weighted average long term rate of return assumption for plan assets as of January 1, 2007 is 8.5%. Our 2007 net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease from 2006 due to additional cash contributions made in recent years, returns on plan assets in excess of expectations and small increases in the discount rates of certain countries. Our required minimum amount of 2007 contributions will not exceed actual contributions made in 2006. Stock based compensation. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black Scholes Merton pricing model. The outstanding term of an option is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term of the option, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employee who receives the option. Expected volatility during the estimated outstanding term of the option is based on historical volatility during a period equivalent to the estimated outstanding term of the option and implied volatility as determined based on observed market prices of our publicly traded options. Expected dividends during the estimated outstanding term of the option are based on recent dividend activity. Risk free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant. We estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant, adjusted for any restrictive provisions affecting fair value, such as required holding periods after the date of vesting. Compensation expense for share based payment is charged to operations over the vesting period of the award, and includes an estimate for the number of awards expected to vest. The initial estimate is based on historical results, and compensation expense is adjusted for 28 actual results. If vesting of such an award is conditioned upon the achievement of performance goals, compensation expense during the performance period is estimated using the most probable outcome of the performance goals, and adjusted as the expected outcome changes. Other liabilities. In the normal course of business, we may provide certain clients, principally governmental entities, with financial performance guarantees, which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client, the likelihood of which we believe is remote. We believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee. There are various claims and pending actions against EDS arising in the ordinary course of our business. See Note 15 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain current litigation. Certain of these actions seek damages in significant amounts. In determining whether a loss accrual or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements is required, we consider, among other things, the degree to which we can make a reasonable estimate of the loss, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome, and the applicability of insurance coverage for a loss. The degree of probability and the loss related to a particular claim are typically estimated with the assistance of legal counsel. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. A discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments, and further disclosure relating to financial instruments, are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is managed through our debt portfolio of fixed and variable rate instruments including interest rate swaps. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of 10% in short term market interest rates. If these rates average 10% more in 2007 than in 2006, there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. During 2006, had short term market interest rates averaged 10% more than in 2005, there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. Foreign exchange risk. We conduct business in the United States and around the world. Our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Western European countries that use the euro as a common currency, Australia, India and Switzerland. The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and may enter into currency options with durations of generally less than 30 days to hedge such transactions. We have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Generally, foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings. In addition, since we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge, any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss, as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract. Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of 10% in foreign currency rates against the U.S. dollar. If these rates average 10% more in 2007 than in 2006, there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. During 2006, had foreign currency rates averaged 10% more than in 2005, there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position. 29
