ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses the results of operations and general financial condition of Cadmus. MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report in Item 8. CHANGES TO PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FISCAL 2006 FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL RESULTS Subsequent to the August 3, 2006 announcement of our preliminary fourth quarter and full fiscal year results for 2006, we have made certain adjustments to our reported results. These adjustments resulted in an increase in fourth quarter net loss and a reduction in full fiscal year net income for 2006 of $0.5 million. These adjustments principally relate to decreases in our inventories and certain customer billings to correct errors that were identified through control procedures that were performed subsequent to the date of our earnings release. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the August 3, 2006 announcement of our preliminary results press release to amounts reported in this Annual Report on Form 10 K which reflects the above mentioned adjustments (in millions, except per share amounts) : Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 Year Ended June 30, 2006 PreviouslyAnnounced Net Change Reported inAnnualReport onForm 10 K PreviouslyAnnounced Net Change Reported inAnnualReport onForm 10 K Net sales $ 113.5 $ (0.2 ) $ 113.3 $ 451.4 $ (0.2 ) $ 451.2 Operating income 1.1 (0.7 ) 0.4 11.3 (0.7 ) 10.6 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (3.0 ) (0.7 ) (3.7 ) (3.9 ) (0.7 ) (4.6 ) Benefit from income taxes 1.2 0.2 1.4 10.1 0.2 10.3 Net income (loss) (1.8 ) (0.5 ) (2.3 ) 6.2 (0.5 ) 5.7 Net income (loss) per common share, assuming dilution (0.20 ) (0.04 ) (0.24 ) 0.65 (0.04 ) 0.61 GENERAL Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Cadmus Communications Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company or Cadmus) provides end to end, integrated graphic communications and content processing services to professional publishers, not for profit societies and corporations. Cadmus provides a wide range of technology enabled content management, composition, editorial, prepress, printing, article reprints, digital rights management, and fulfillment and distribution services. Cadmus is the worlds largest provider of content management and production services to scientific, technical and medical (STM) journal publishers, the fifth largest periodicals printer in North America, and a leading provider of specialty packaging and promotional printing services. The Company is focused on two segments. The Publisher Services segment provides products and services to both not for profit and commercial publishers in three primary product lines: STM journals, special interest and trade magazines, and books and directories. Publisher Services provides a full range of content management, editorial, prepress, printing, reprinting, warehousing and distribution services. The Specialty Packaging segment provides high quality specialty packaging and promotional printing, assembly, fulfillment and distribution services to consumer product companies, healthcare companies and other customers. 19 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Company focuses primarily on niche markets where it sees underlying demand strength, a willingness on the part of customers to outsource non core activities, and relatively few large and well positioned competitors. More specifically, the Company has focused on providing outsourced publisher services (both content processing and printing) for the scholarly publishing, educational and other markets. The Company has a leading position in the STM market and delivers customized content processing services using state of the art technologies, in addition to traditional print services. The Company has continued to invest in opportunities in the educational and government services markets and in the proprietary technology products known as Emerging Solutions. The Companys Specialty Packaging segment has achieved growth and improved financial performance in recent years as a result of focusing on growth markets that benefit from the customized package design and production services the Company offers, particularly in the healthcare, consumer products and telecommunications markets as well as the expansion of its global network. The Companys U.S. packaging facility is both ISO 9001:2000 registered and has passed customer cGMP compliance audits as evidence of the high level of quality delivered to our customers. The Specialty Packaging segment has also differentiated itself by developing a proprietary network of offshore production affiliates, known as Global Packaging Solutions, and by linking those operations and its customers via a proprietary inventory management and fulfillment system. In June 2005, the Company initiated a comprehensive equipment replacement and consolidation plan to its Publisher Services print platform and Specialty Packaging capabilities. The plan is designed to continue to grow the Companys position in its target publishing markets, to sustain the growth generated in its Specialty Packaging segment, to retire older and less efficient press equipment, and to more aggressively rationalize capacity across its manufacturing platform. In connection with this equipment replacement and consolidation plan, the Company is consolidating two facilities and expanding and renovating several other facilities to accommodate new equipment, to permit improved work flows, and to facilitate the rationalization of similar work currently performed at multiple sites. The Company spent approximately $58.2 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006, the majority of which related to this plan. It is expected that the equipment upgrades and the expansion of facilities will be substantially complete by the middle of fiscal 2007. Despite the adverse effect in fiscal 2006 of operational inefficiencies from the implementation of the equipment replacement and consolidation plan, the Company believes that once fully implemented, the plan will enhance the Companys overall competitiveness and create significant long term value for its shareholders. In fiscal 2006, the Company purchased the remaining interest in KnowledgeWorks Global Limited (KGL) from Datamatics Technologies Limited, with whom the Company had operated a joint venture in India since fiscal 2003. KGL provides a full range of content processing, content management and related services to STM, scholarly and educational publishers and other organizations on a global basis. The Company believes KGL provides the ability to continue to grow its services to the STM and educational markets and expand its offshore outsourcing opportunities. At the end of fiscal 2006, the Companys Specialty Packaging segment formed a 50/50 joint venture in Hong Kong with Periscope, Inc. The joint venture was selected as one of only four global print managers to serve a large U.S. based retail chain. The Company believes this opportunity will permit it to apply its global brand management expertise on a much larger scale as it expands the print and packaging network beyond the Caribbean Rim to mainland China, Thailand, India and Turkey. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 20 Table of Contents The Company considers the following accounting policies to be critical policies which involve various estimation processes: Allowance for doubtful accounts Valuation of intangible assets and goodwill Pension and other post retirement benefits Income taxes Self insurance reserves Allowance for doubtful accounts. Cadmus policy with respect to its trade receivables is to maintain an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments. The Companys process to estimate the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable balances consists of two steps. First, the Company evaluates specific accounts for which it has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy). In these cases, the Company uses its judgment, based on available facts and circumstances, and records a specific allowance for that customer against the receivable to reflect the amount it expects to ultimately collect. Second, the Company establishes an additional reserve for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories, based on managements best estimate. The Company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves based on the available facts and circumstances at the time. If the financial condition of Cadmus customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. Valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. In completing the transitional impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company tested the net goodwill balances attributable to each of its reporting units for indications of impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined using discounted cash flow estimates for each reporting unit in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The preparation of such discounted cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment with respect to operating profit, growth rates, appropriate discount rates and residual values. The Company has completed annual impairment tests as of April 1 of each year since the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The tests were conducted in a manner consistent with the Companys initial impairment test. As a result of those annual impairment tests, there were no indications of impairment, and no adjustments to the carrying amount of goodwill were required. The total balance of goodwill as of June 30, 2006 and 2005 relates to the Companys Publisher Services segment. Pension and other post retirement benefits. The Company sponsors certain pension and other post retirement plans covering associates who meet eligibility requirements. Several factors are used to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions determined by the Company about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and rate of future compensation increases. In addition, the Companys actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the impact of these trends on expense and liability amounts. The economic and actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. While the Company believes its assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the Companys assumptions may materially affect its pension and other post retirement obligations and its future expense. In fiscal 2004, upon completion of its annual pension valuations, the Company recorded a reduction of its minimum pension liability in fiscal 2004 in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, totaling $19.4 million ($12.7 million net of taxes). The adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct increase to shareholders equity, net of taxes. 21 Table of Contents In fiscal 2005, upon completion of its annual pension valuations, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87 totaling $12.7 million ($8.4 million net of taxes). The adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct charge to shareholders equity, net of taxes. In fiscal 2006, upon completion of its annual pension valuations, the Company recorded a decrease to its minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87 totaling $6.9 million ($4.3 million net of taxes). The adjustment to the minimum pension liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct increase to shareholders equity, net of taxes. The Companys contributions to its defined benefit pension plans totaled $1.2 million, $1.3 million, and $9.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company anticipates having to contribute $2.5 million to its primary defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2007, and to contribute $1.1 million to its other defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2003, the Companys board of directors voted to freeze the Cadmus Pension Plan to mitigate the volatility in pension expense and required cash contributions expected in future years. For the Companys primary defined benefit plan, a one percentage point change in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have the following impact on fiscal 2007 pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation, respectively: 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease (In thousands) Effect on 2007 pension expense $ (1,015 ) $ 1,015 Effect on accumulated benefit obligation For the Companys primary defined benefit plan, a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have the following impact on fiscal 2007 pension expense and accumulated benefit obligation, respectively: 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease (In thousands) Effect on 2007 pension expense $ (937 ) $ 1,080 Effect on accumulated benefit obligation (15,268 ) 18,874 Changes in the discount rate noted above also impact unrecognized losses, another component of pension expense. As a result, a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate will not have a correspondingly equal impact on overall pension expense. Income taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition to estimating the actual current tax liability, the Company must assess future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, and operating loss carryforwards. Such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent recovery is not considered likely, establishes a valuation allowance against those assets. The valuation allowance is based on estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable. Judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets. The Company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the Internal Revenue Service and is sometimes audited by both federal and state tax agencies. From time to time, those audits may result in proposed 22 Table of Contents adjustments. The Company has considered these potential adjustments and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of the various audits. To the extent that actual results differ from managements estimates, new information results in changes to estimates, or there is a material change in the actual tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or adjust the effective tax rate which could materially impact the Companys financial position and results of operations. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 provides guidance on financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements. Self insurance reserves. The Company is self insured for both medical and workers compensation claims. The Company engages third party firms to provide claims processing for its medical and workers compensation claims, and to calculate ultimate loss projections relative to its workers compensation claims. The Company records its reserves for medical and workers compensation claims based on the information supplied by the third party firms. The Companys policy is to adjust its workers compensation reserve based on an analysis of individual claims at each reporting date, with considerations of stop loss insurance provisions for both aggregate claim years and individual claims. The Company maintains a medical reserve for claims incurred but not reported based on its best estimate of its ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred as of the reporting date. Actual claims expense, as well as changes in the healthcare cost trends, could result in the Companys eventual cost differing from the estimate. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS Restructuring and Other Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company initiated a comprehensive equipment replacement and consolidation plan to its Publisher Services print platform and Specialty Packaging capabilities. This plan is designed to replace certain older, less efficient presses with state of the art and more efficient presses, to add certain needed capacity, and to permit the further rationalization of domestic manufacturing capacity. As a result, certain equipment and related items to be replaced or disposed of pursuant to this plan were impaired in the amount of $4.9 million as of June 30, 2005. In fiscal 2006 in connection with this plan, the Company incurred charges of $4.8 million related to severance expenses, costs to consolidate and reorganize facilities, and impairment charges of equipment to be replaced. These charges for fiscal 2006 and 2005 were primarily related to the Publisher Services segment and are classified as restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Excluding asset impairment charges, the estimated total restructuring costs pursuant to this plan include (i) one time termination benefits in the range of $1.5 million to $1.7 million, (ii) contract termination costs in the range of $0.2 million to $0.3 million, and (iii) costs to consolidate and reorganize facilities in the range of $1.8 million to $2.1 million. All activities in connection with this plan are expected to be completed by the middle of fiscal 2007. Other charges and expenses classified as restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations include (i) costs in connection with a management reorganization of the Companys Publisher Services segment and related charges in the amount of $2.0 million in fiscal 2006, (ii) expenses associated with the Mack Printing Company transaction in the amount of $0.5 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, 23 Table of Contents respectively, and (iii) costs associated with certain discontinued merger and acquisition activities in the amount of $0.8 million in fiscal 2006. Income Taxes During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, the Company participated in the Pre Filing Agreement program (PFA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to review the Mack Printing Company transaction (Mack transaction) to determine the amount and character of the allowable loss to be reported on its federal income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2005. In culmination of the PFA process, the Company and the IRS executed a closing agreement on March 28, 2006 providing specific guidance for the recognition of an ordinary loss deduction to be reported by the Company on its June 30, 2005 federal tax return. Based on the Companys resolution with the IRS and as a result of reporting the Mack transaction benefit on its June 30, 2005 federal tax return filed on March 15, 2006, the Company recorded an $8.5 million benefit for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. This $8.5 million benefit was incremental to the $5.0 million recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2005. As a result of the resolution with the IRS in connection with the Mack transaction, the Company expects to realize a cash benefit of $37.4 million. The Company received $11.8 million in April 2006 and $2.6 million in August 2006 and expects to utilize the balance in future years as a reduction to income taxes otherwise payable on future income earned. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents the major components from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percent of net sales for fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 451.2 100.0 % $ 436.4 100.0 % $ 445.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 390.2 86.5 358.9 82.2 363.6 81.6 Selling and administrative expenses 42.3 9.4 43.2 9.9 47.5 10.7 Restructuring and other charges 8.1 1.8 5.2 1.2 0.4 0.1 Other income (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Operating income 10.6 2.3 30.1 6.9 33.9 7.6 Interest expense 14.9 3.3 12.9 3.0 14.2 3.2 Debt refinancing costs 8.3 1.9 Securitization costs 0.3 0.1 Other, net 0.3 0.1 0.3 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (4.6 ) (1.0 ) 17.1 3.9 10.8 2.4 Income tax benefit (expense) 10.3 2.3 (1.2 ) (0.3 ) (4.1 ) (0.9 ) Income from continuing operations 5.7 1.3 15.9 3.6 6.7 1.5 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.9 0.2 Net income $ 5.7 1.3 % $ 15.0 3.4 % $ 6.7 1.5 % Capital expenditures $ 58.2 12.9 % $ 12.1 2.8 % $ 15.1 3.4 % 24 Table of Contents In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company has included certain non GAAP financial measures to provide information to assist investors in understanding the underlying operational performance of the Company. Refer to the Use of GAAP and Non GAAP Measures later in this discussion for additional information on these measures. The following table presents certain non GAAP measures as a percent of net sales and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Operating income, as reported $ 10.6 2.3 % $ 30.1 6.9 % $ 33.9 7.6 % Restructuring and other charges 8.1 1.8 5.2 1.2 0.4 0.1 Other income (insurance recovery) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted operating income $ 18.7 4.1 % $ 34.3 7.9 % $ 34.3 7.7 % Income (loss) from continuing operations beforeincome taxes, as reported $ (4.6 ) (1.0 )% $ 17.1 3.9 % $ 10.8 2.4 % Restructuring and other charges 8.1 1.8 5.2 1.2 0.4 0.1 Debt refinancing costs 8.3 1.9 Other income (insurance recovery) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted income from continuing operationsbefore income taxes $ 3.5 0.8 % $ 21.3 4.9 % $ 19.5 4.4 % Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 Income per share, assuming dilution: Net income, as reported $ 0.61 $ 1.60 $ 0.72 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.10 Other income (insurance recovery), net of taxes (0.07 ) Restructuring and other charges, net of taxes 0.54 0.36 0.03 Debt refinancing costs, net of taxes 0.59 Mack benefit (0.90 ) (0.54 ) Adjusted income per share, assuming dilution $ 0.25 $ 1.45 $ 1.34 Comparison of Fiscal 2006 with Fiscal 2005 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2006 were $451.2 million, compared to $436.4 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 3.4%. Within the Publisher Services segment, net sales totaled $363.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $358.3 million in the prior year, an increase of 1.4%. The increase was a result of page and revenue growth from the STM market, improved revenues from its content related initiatives in the educational and government services markets, continued growth in its emerging solutions technology offerings, and better revenue trends in its printing plants, despite continuing price pressures. Net sales for the Specialty Packaging segment were $87.7 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $78.2 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 12.3%. The increase in net sales for this segment was attributable to the continued benefit from higher overall volume in its Global Packaging Solutions operations, expansion into Asia, strong new business development success, and growth from existing customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased to 86.5% of net sales in fiscal 2006, compared to 82.2% in fiscal 2005. The percentage increase was primarily due to much higher costs from operational inefficiencies and capacity 25 Table of Contents constraints from the Lancaster and Science Press sites integration activities in connection with the equipment replacement and consolidation plan. Additional costs also were incurred at other sites to produce off loaded work from Lancaster to meet customer schedules. Finally, the results were adversely affected by costs incurred in connection with the Companys growth initiatives in the educational and government services markets and higher energy costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.4% and 9.9% in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to managements continued focus on overall cost reduction efforts, streamlining the organizational structure in the Publisher Services segment, and lower management incentives. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges were $8.1 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $5.2 million in fiscal 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company initiated a comprehensive equipment replacement and consolidation plan to its Publisher Services print platform and Specialty Packaging capabilities. This plan is designed to replace certain older, less efficient presses with state of the art and more efficient presses, to add certain needed capacity, and to permit the further rationalization of domestic manufacturing capacity. As a result, certain equipment and related items to be replaced or disposed of pursuant to this plan were impaired in the amount of $4.9 million as of June 30, 2005. In connection with this plan, the Company incurred charges of $4.8 million in fiscal 2006 related to severance expenses, costs to consolidate and reorganize facilities, and impairment charges of equipment to be replaced. These charges were primarily related to the Publisher Services segment and are classified as restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Excluding asset impairment charges, the estimated total restructuring costs pursuant to this plan include (i) one time termination benefits in the range of $1.5 million to $1.7 million, (ii) contract termination costs in the range of $0.2 million to $0.3 million, and (iii) costs to consolidate and reorganize facilities in the range of $1.8 million to $2.1 million. All activities in connection with this plan are expected to be completed by the middle of fiscal 2007. Other charges and expenses classified as restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations include (i) costs in connection with a management reorganization of the Companys Publisher Services segment and related charges in the amount of $2.0 million in fiscal 2006, (ii) expenses associated with the Mack Printing Company transaction in the amount of $0.5 million and $0.3 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, and (iii) costs associated with certain discontinued merger and acquisition activities in the amount of $0.8 million in fiscal 2006. Operating Income Operating income in fiscal 2006 was $10.6 million, compared to $30.1 million in fiscal 2005. Publisher Services and Specialty Packaging segment operating income was $18.0 million and $7.5 million in fiscal 2006, respectively, compared to $35.8 million and $7.4 million in fiscal 2005. Publisher Services operating income declined primarily due to much higher costs from operational inefficiencies and capacity constraints from the Lancaster and Science Press sites integration activities and additional costs incurred at other sites to produce off loaded work from Lancaster to meet customer schedules. In addition, margins were adversely affected by (i) continued pricing pressures, primarily in the special interest magazine market, (ii) costs incurred in connection with the Companys growth initiatives in the educational and government services markets, and (iii) higher energy costs. Specialty Packaging operating income improved due to the benefits from higher overall volume and efficiencies derived from new and more efficient technology and enhancements and expansions to its global capacity and work flows. 26 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income included $8.1 million and $5.2 million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The results for fiscal 2005 included $1.0 million in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year operating results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2006 % ofSales 2005 % ofSales (Dollars in thousands) Operating income, as reported $ 10,576 2.3 % $ 30,101 6.9 % Restructuring and other charges 8,084 1.8 5,219 1.2 Other income (insurance recovery) (1,000 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted operating income $ 18,660 4.1 % $ 34,320 7.9 % Interest and Other Expenses Interest expense increased to $14.9 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $12.9 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due primarily to (i) an increase in total debt of $43.9 million for fiscal 2006, excluding the fair market value of interest rate swap agreements, in connection with the capital expenditures of $58.2 million primarily related to the equipment replacement and consolidation plan, and (ii) higher interest rates in fiscal 2006. Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes totaled $(4.6) million in fiscal 2006, compared to $17.1 million in fiscal 2005. These results reflect the impact of $8.1 million and $5.2 million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, and include $1.0 million in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery in fiscal 2005. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2006 % ofSales 2005 % ofSales (Dollars in thousands) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes,as reported $ (4,608 ) (1.0 )% $ 17,110 3.9 % Restructuring and other charges 8,084 1.8 5,219 1.2 Other income (insurance recovery) (1,000 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 3,476 0.8 % $ 21,329 4.9 % Income Taxes The Companys income tax benefit on continuing operations in fiscal 2006 was at an effective tax rate of 224.4%, compared to an income tax expense on continuing operations in fiscal 2005 at an effective tax rate of 7.2%. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company executed a transaction related to one of its subsidiaries, Mack Printing Company, and recognized a net tax benefit of $5.0 million. During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, the Company participated in the Pre Filing Agreement program (PFA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to review the Mack transaction to determine the amount and character of the allowable loss to be reported on its federal income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2005. In culmination of the PFA process, the Company and the IRS executed a closing agreement on March 28, 2006 providing specific guidance for the recognition of an ordinary loss deduction to be reported by the Company on its June 30, 2005 federal tax return. Based on the Companys resolution with the IRS and as a result of reporting the Mack transaction benefit on its June 30, 2005 federal tax return filed on March 15, 2006, the Company recorded an 27 Table of Contents $8.5 million benefit for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. This $8.5 million benefit was incremental to the $5.0 million recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2005. As a result of the resolution with the IRS in connection with the Mack transaction, the Company expects to realize a net cash benefit of $37.4 million. The Company received $11.8 million in April 2006 and $2.6 million in August 2006 and expects to utilize the balance in future years as a reduction to income taxes otherwise payable on future income earned. The amount of tax benefit and tax expense in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, differs from the amount obtained by application of the federal statutory rate primarily due to recognition of the Mack transaction tax benefit and the impact of state income taxes. Discontinued Operations In January 2002, the Company sold its Atlanta based Cadmus Creative Marketing division and reported a $1.2 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. In connection with this sale, the Company entered into a lease guaranty and other agreements. In March 2005, the purchaser/tenant under the lease filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on its lease obligations. As a result, the Company recorded an estimate of its potential obligations under the guaranty and other costs in discontinued operations totaling approximately $1.5 million, net of $0.8 million in taxes, in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 pursuant to a settlement for the lease guaranty and other revised cost estimates, the Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations in the amount of $0.6 million, net of $0.3 million in taxes. The combined impact for fiscal 2005 was a loss from discontinued operations of $0.9 million, net of $0.5 million in taxes. Net Income Net income totaled $5.7 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2005. Included in the results in fiscal 2006 are restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million, net of $3.0 million in taxes, and a tax benefit in connection with the Mack transaction in the amount of $8.5 million. Included in the results for fiscal 2005 are restructuring and other charges of $3.3 million, net of $1.9 million in taxes, a tax benefit in connection with the Mack transaction in the amount of $5.0 million, the impact from discontinued operations of $0.9 million, net of $0.5 million in taxes, and $0.6 million, net of $0.4 million in taxes, of other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery. Earnings Per Share Net income per share, assuming dilution, totaled $0.61 in fiscal 2006, compared to $1.60 in fiscal 2005. These results reflect the impact of (i) $8.1 million and $5.2 million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, (ii) $8.3 million and $5.0 million due to the Mack transaction tax benefit in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, (iii) $ 0.9 million loss (net of taxes) from discontinued operations in fiscal 2005, and (iv) $0.6 million (net of taxes) in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery in fiscal 2005. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2006 2005 Income per share, assuming dilution: Net income, as reported $ 0.61 $ 1.60 Restructuring and other charges, net of taxes 0.54 0.36 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.10 Other income (insurance recovery), net of taxes (0.07 ) Mack benefit (0.90 ) (0.54 ) Adjusted income per share, assuming dilution $ 0.25 $ 1.45 28 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal 2005 with Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Net sales in fiscal 2005 were $436.4 million, compared to $445.4 million in fiscal 2004, a decline of 2.0%. Within the Publisher Services segment, net sales totaled $358.3 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $380.2 million in the prior year, a decline of 5.8%. The decline was a result of (i) lower freight and postage (which are pass through costs for the Company), (ii) continuing pricing pressures from customers going out for bid, and (iii) managements plan to manage capacity, improve business mix by focusing on education and higher margin customers, and generally drive for higher margins in the special interest magazine market. Net sales for the Specialty Packaging segment were $78.2 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $65.2 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of 19.9%. The increase in net sales for this segment was attributable to the continued benefit from higher overall volume in its Global Packaging Solutions operations, strong new business development success, and growth from existing customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased to 82.2% of net sales in fiscal 2005, compared to 81.6% of net sales in fiscal 2004. The percentage increase was primarily due to additional costs and resources associated with the ramp up of services within the Publisher Services segment including educational market initiatives and certain electronic products and solutions for the professional publishing market. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.9% and 10.7% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to lower payroll costs associated with the reduction in the number of domestic associates, cost savings initiatives in the Companys medical and workers compensation plans, and managements continued focus on overall cost reduction efforts. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges were $5.2 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $0.4 million in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company initiated a comprehensive equipment upgrade plan to its Publisher Services print platform and Specialty Packaging capabilities. As a result, certain equipment and related items to be replaced or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this plan were impaired as of June 30, 2005. As discussed in Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded a $4.9 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 related to the Publisher Services segment and classified the charge as restructuring and other charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Also in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a $0.3 million charge in restructuring and other charges in connection with expenses associated with the internal restructuring of a subsidiary. Fiscal 2004 restructuring and others charges relate primarily to the closure of the Companys East Stroudsburg special interest magazine facility. Operating Income Operating income in fiscal 2005 was $30.1 million, compared to $33.9 million in fiscal 2004. Publisher Services and Specialty Packaging segment operating income was $35.8 million and $7.4 million in fiscal 2005, respectively, compared to $38.8 million and $4.3 million in fiscal 2004. Publisher Services operating income declined due to continued pricing pressures, increased severance costs, and investments made to support educational and Emerging Solutions initiatives. Specialty Packaging operating income improved due to higher overall volume, improved business mix, and efficiencies derived from new and more efficient technology and workflows. 29 Table of Contents Consolidated operating income included $5.2 million and $0.4 million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the results in fiscal 2005 included $1.0 million in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year operating results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2005 % ofSales 2004 % ofSales (Dollars in thousands) Operating income, as reported $ 30,101 6.9 % $ 33,895 7.6 % Restructuring and other charges 5,219 1.2 410 0.1 Other income (insurance recovery) (1,000 ) (0.2 ) Adjusted operating income $ 34,320 7.9 % $ 34,305 7.7 % Interest and Other Expenses Interest and securitization costs declined to $12.9 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $14.5 million in fiscal 2004. The decrease was due primarily to (i) lower debt levels during fiscal 2005, (ii) lower year over year interest rates on the Companys senior subordinated notes which were refinanced in June 2004, (iii) the positive impact of interest rate swap agreements, and (iv) the termination of the accounts receivable securitization program in January 2004. In fiscal 2004, the Company incurred $8.3 million of debt refinancing costs associated with the refinancing of its 9.75% senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million consisting primarily of $6.8 million for the tender premium and $1.5 million for the net write off of deferred loan costs related to the old notes and related swap agreement. Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes Income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled $17.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $10.8 million in fiscal 2004. These results reflect the impact of $5.2 million and $0.4 million in restructuring and other charges reported in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, include $1.0 million in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery in fiscal 2005, and include $8.3 million in debt refinancing costs in fiscal 2004. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2005 % ofSales 2004 % ofSales (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported $ 17,110 3.9 % $ 10,776 2.4 % Restructuring and other charges 5,219 1.2 410 0.1 Other income (insurance recovery) (1,000 ) (0.2 ) Debt refinancing costs 8,275 1.9 Adjusted income from continuing operationsbefore income taxes $ 21,329 4.9 % $ 19,461 4.4 % Income Taxes The Companys income tax expense on continuing operations in fiscal 2005 was at an effective tax rate of 7.2%, compared to an effective tax rate of 38.3% in fiscal 2004. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company executed a transaction related to one of its subsidiaries, Mack Printing Company, and recognized a net tax benefit of $5.0 million. The amount of tax expense in fiscal 2005 differs from the amount obtained by application of the federal statutory rate primarily due to recognition of the Mack transaction tax benefit and the 30 Table of Contents impact of state income taxes. For fiscal 2004, the amount of tax expense from continuing operations differs from the amount obtained by application of the federal statutory rate to income from continuing operations primarily due to the reversal of certain valuation allowances and the impact of state income taxes. Discontinued Operations In January 2002, the Company sold its Atlanta based Cadmus Creative Marketing division and reported a $1.2 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. In connection with this sale, the Company entered into a lease guaranty and other agreements. In March 2005, the purchaser/tenant under the lease filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on its lease obligations. As a result, the Company recorded an estimate of its potential obligations under the guaranty and other costs in discontinued operations totaling approximately $1.5 million, net of $0.8 million in taxes, in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 pursuant to a settlement for the lease guaranty and other revised cost estimates, the Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations in the amount of $0.6 million, net of $0.3 million in taxes. The combined impact for fiscal 2005 was a loss from discontinued operations of $0.9 million, net of $0.5 million in taxes. Net Income Net income totaled $15.0 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $6.7 million for fiscal 2004. Included in the results for fiscal 2005 are restructuring and other charges of $3.4 million, net of $1.8 million in taxes, a tax benefit in connection with the Mack Printing Company transaction in the amount of $5.0 million, the impact from discontinued operations of $0.9 million, net of $0.5 million in taxes, and $0.6 million, net of $0.4 million in taxes, of other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery. Included in the results for fiscal 2004 are restructuring and other charges of $0.2 million, net of $0.1 million in taxes. Earnings Per Share Net income per share, assuming dilution, totaled $1.60 in fiscal 2005 and $0.72 in fiscal 2004. These results reflect the impact of (i) $5.2 million and $0.4 million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, (ii) $1.0 million in other income from a previously disclosed insurance recovery in fiscal 2005, (iii) $5.0 million Mack benefit in fiscal 2005, (iv) $0.9 million loss (net of taxes) from discontinued operations in fiscal 2005, and (v) $8.3 million in debt refinancing costs in fiscal 2004. In order to provide consistent comparisons of year over year results, the following reconciliation is provided: 2005 2004 Income per share, assuming dilution: Net income, as reported $ 1.60 $ 0.72 Restructuring and other charges, net of taxes 0.36 0.03 Discontinued operations, net of taxes 0.10 Other income (insurance recovery), net of taxes (0.07 ) Debt refinancing costs, net of taxes 0.59 Mack benefit (0.54 ) Adjusted income per share, assuming dilution $ 1.45 $ 1.34 USE OF GAAP AND NON GAAP MEASURES In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company included in this report certain non GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures used in this report are not GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure. For each non GAAP financial measure, the Company has presented the most directly comparable 31 Table of Contents GAAP financial measure and has reconciled the non GAAP financial measure with such comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company included the following non GAAP financial measures in this report: (1) adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin adjusted to exclude restructuring and other charges of $8.1 million, $5.2 million, $0.4 million and $12.0 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, to exclude the impact of the $1.0 million insurance recovery for fiscal 2005, and to exclude goodwill amortization expense of $4.7 million for fiscal 2002, (2) adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes and adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes margin adjusted in the same manner and for the same items as adjusted operating income, and to exclude the impact of $8.3 million in debt refinancing costs for fiscal 2004, and (3) adjusted income per share adjusted in the same manner and for the same items as adjusted operating income and to exclude the $8.5 million and $5.0 million tax benefit from the Mack transaction for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, to exclude the loss from discontinued operations of $0.9 million and $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 and 2002, respectively, to exclude $8.3 million in debt refinancing costs for fiscal 2004, and to exclude the impact of the $56.3 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, which was recorded upon the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 142, for fiscal 2003. In the Companys Form 10 K for fiscal 2005, other income in fiscal 2005 of $1.0 million, or $0.07 per share, related to an insurance recovery, was not excluded from the non GAAP measures. For purposes of the discussion in this report, however, the impact of the insurance recovery has been excluded from the fiscal 2005 non GAAP measures as management believes that excluding the impact of the insurance recovery for year over year comparisons better reflects the trends of the underlying operational performance of the business. These non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors to assist in understanding the underlying operational performance of the Company. Specifically, (1) the exclusion of restructuring and other charges permits comparisons of results for on going business facilities under the current operating structure, (2) the exclusion of the insurance recovery permits comparisons of trends in the underlying operational performance of the Company, (3) the exclusion of the impact of the tax benefit resulting from the Mack transaction permits comparisons of business operations without the impact of certain tax items, (4) the exclusion of the impact of discontinued operations permits comparisons of continuing business operations, (5) the exclusion of the debt refinancing costs incurred permits comparisons of results without the impact of infrequent refinancing actions, and (6) the exclusion of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle permits comparisons without the impact of financial results driven solely by the adoption of new accounting pronouncements. In addition, the Company uses these non GAAP financial measures internally to measure its on going business performance and in reports to bankers to permit monitoring of the Companys ability to repay outstanding liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, the primary cash requirements of the Company have been for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, taxes, pension funding, share repurchases and dividends. The primary sources of liquidity in the past have been cash flow provided by operations and unused capacity under the Companys senior bank credit facility. The Companys ability to continue to meet these and other cash requirements in the short and long term depends on, without limitation, the Companys ability to implement its business strategy and the success of that strategy in generating cash from operations, the Companys continued access to credit on practicable terms, access to the capital markets as needed and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. The Company believes that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its operating requirements for capital expenditures and working capital. 32 Table of Contents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006 totaled $20.0 million, compared to $24.6 million in fiscal 2005. The $4.6 million decrease in fiscal 2006 was attributable to lower earnings and $3.6 million in restructuring payments, partially offset by year over year changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 totaled $24.6 million, compared to $31.3 million in fiscal 2004. The $6.7 million decrease in fiscal 2005 was attributable to changes in certain operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower contributions to the Companys defined benefit pension plans and higher earnings. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $60.3 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $12.3 million in fiscal 2005. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 were $58.2 million compared to $12.1 million in fiscal 2005 and included investments primarily in equipment for the Publisher Services and Specialty Packaging segments in connection with the Companys equipment replacement and consolidation plan. Acquisitions were $2.8 million in fiscal 2006 and relate primarily to the purchase of the remaining third party owned minority interest of the Companys KGL operations in India. Net cash used in investing activities was $12.3 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $13.7 million in fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 were $12.1 million, compared to $15.1 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 expenditures related primarily to equipment purchases for the Publisher Services and Special Packaging segments. Fiscal 2004 expenditures related primarily to new business and manufacturing systems, digital prepress equipment, and building and equipment improvements. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2004 totaled $1.4 million and related primarily to the sale of presses at certain of the Companys Virginia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania locations, and the sale of the East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania facility in the fourth quarter. The Company estimates that capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 will be in the range of $16.0 million to $18.0 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.2 million in fiscal 2006, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $13.9 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, proceeds from net long term borrowings of $44.3 million primarily undertaken for capital expenditures in connection with the Companys equipment replacement and consolidation plan, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.0 million, were partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $3.5 million, and dividend payments of $2.3 million. On July 26, 2006, the Company completed an amendment to its senior bank credit facility effective June 30, 2006, which modified: (1) the total leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio covenants, (2) the definition of permitted acquisition, and (3) the circumstances under which the Company may make restricted payments. In accordance with the senior bank credit facility, as amended, further limitations are placed on the Companys ability to execute acquisitions and repurchase stock based on the total leverage ratio which is computed from time to time. Based on the total leverage ratio computed as of June 30, 2006, the Company is prohibited from executing acquisitions or repurchasing stock without consent from the lenders or until such time as the total leverage ratio declines as required in the senior bank credit facility, as amended. In addition, the amendment added certain borrowing base requirements to the senior bank credit facility which limited the Companys total borrowings under the senior bank credit facility to an amount equal to the lesser of $100.0 million or the product of certain percentages multiplied by eligible accounts receivable, inventory and property, plant and equipment. 33 Table of Contents The Company originally refinanced its senior bank credit facility, which was to mature on March 31, 2004, on January 28, 2004. Concurrently, the Company terminated its accounts receivable securitization program. The senior bank credit facility will mature in January 2008. The facility, with a group of seven banks, is secured by substantially all of the Companys real, personal and mixed property, is jointly and severally guaranteed by each of the Companys present and future significant subsidiaries, and is secured by a pledge of the capital stock of present and future significant subsidiaries. The senior bank credit facility contains certain covenants regarding total leverage, senior leverage, fixed charge coverage and net worth, and contains other restrictions, including limitations on additional borrowings, and the acquisition, disposition and securitization of assets. At June 30, 2006, there were $62.2 million in borrowings outstanding under the $100.0 million senior bank credit facility and approximately $2.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding against which no claims had been made. Based upon the borrowing base computation included in the senior bank credit facility, as amended, the Companys total available borrowings were limited to approximately $89.7 million. Therefore, the Companys revolving credit availability was approximately $24.9 million at June 30, 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $13.9 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $16.3 million in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, a decrease in total debt by $10.8 million due to lower capital spending and continued focus on working capital initiatives, $2.3 million in dividend payments, and $3.9 million in stock repurchases, were partially offset by $3.0 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options. On October 18, 2004, the Company completed an exchange offering in which it exchanged $125.0 million of its 8.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014, which were registered effective August 30, 2004 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for its $125.0 million 8.375% senior subordinated notes due 2014, which were issued in a private placement on June 15, 2004. The Company used the net proceeds from the private placement, together with borrowings under its revolving credit facility, to repurchase $125 million principal amount outstanding of its 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2009 and to pay the premium, accrued interest, fees and expenses in connection therewith. Market Risk At June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company had three fixed to floating fair value interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a total notional amount of $40.0 million. These swaps were entered into to convert $40.0 million of the Companys 8.375% senior subordinated notes due in 2014 to floating rate debt. The initial term of these swap agreements expires in 2014, and the counterparties have an option to terminate the agreements beginning in June 2009. Under the swap agreements, the Company receives interest payments at a fixed rate of 8.375% and pays interest at a variable rate that is based on six month LIBOR plus a spread. The six month LIBOR rate is reset each December 15 and June 15. These swap agreements are an effective hedge. The notional amount of each swap agreement does not represent exposure to credit loss. In the event of default by the counterparties, the risk, if any, is the cost of replacing the swap agreement at current market rates. The Company continually monitors its positions and the credit rating of its counterparties and limits the amount of agreements it enters into with any one party. Management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties; however, if incurred, any related loss should be immaterial. Additional information on the Companys hedging instruments is provided in Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If short term interest rates were to be either higher or lower by one percentage point throughout fiscal 2007, and assuming the average amount outstanding under both the Companys senior bank credit facility and equipment term loans were consistent with fiscal 2006 and that the average interest rate paid by the Company on the floating portion of its fair value interest rate swap agreement were to be either higher or lower by one percentage point throughout fiscal 2007, the Companys interest expense and income before taxes would change by approximately $1.0 million. 34 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Items In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees and indemnifications in connection with divested or sold operations and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as standby letters of credit and the accounts receivable securitization program until it was terminated in January 2004. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, and management does not expect any material adverse effects on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. The Company maintains certain standby letters of credit to secure its obligations for workers compensation programs. At June 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had approximately $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of standby letters of credit outstanding and had no claims against those letters of credit. Obligations and Commitments The Company is a party to certain contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2006, as summarized in the following table: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 4 to 5years More than5 years (In thousands) Long term debt obligations $ 199,205 $ 2,555 $ 66,064 $ 3,864 $ 126,722 Operating lease obligations 55,363 8,080 13,111 10,518 23,654 Unconditional purchase obligations 5,733 5,733 Executive employment contracts 1,418 473 945 Other long term liabilities 2,476 569 1,040 867 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 264,195 $ 17,410 $ 81,160 $ 15,249 $ 150,376 The Company is required to pay interest, commitment fees and certain other fees on its debt obligations. The Company is required to pay interest at an annual interest rate of 8.375% on its $125.0 million senior subordinated notes in the annual amount of $10.5 million through scheduled maturity on June 15, 2014, unless the notes are repaid or refinanced before that time. The scheduled payments of principal on the 8.375% senior subordinated notes is reflected in long term debt obligations in the table above. For other debt obligations, the amount of interest and other fees will directly depend on borrowing levels, market interest rates, the Companys leverage, and the debt instruments in place during future periods. These amounts can, do and will vary over time. In addition, the Company is required to make certain minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The amount of any contributions will directly depend upon future changes in investment values, rates of return, discount rates, plan benefits and design, and changes in regulatory or legislative rules covering such plans, among other factors. These amounts are not included in the table above due to their contingent and uncertain nature. The Company anticipates having to contribute $2.5 million to its primary defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2007, and to contribute $1.1 million to its other defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2007. 35 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Statements contained in this report relating to Cadmus future prospects and performance are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
