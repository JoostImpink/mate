Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, such as the statements regarding planned capital expenditures, the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures and the number of anticipated wells to be drilled in 1998 and thereafter, are forward looking and are based upon the Companys current belief as to the outcome and timing of such future events. There are numerous risks and uncertainties that can affect the outcome and timing of such events, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. These factors include, but are not limited to, the matters described below. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Companys actual results and plans for 1998 and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business". Volatility of Oil and Gas Prices. The Companys future revenue, profitability and rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of, and the demand for, oil and natural gas. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation due to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond the control of the Company, such as various economic, political and regulatory developments, and competition from other sources of energy. 11 13 Uncertainty of Estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves. Estimating quantities of reserves and future net cash flows is not an exact science. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. This Form 10 K contains estimates of proved oil and gas reserves of the Company and estimated future net cash flows therefrom. Such estimates rely upon various assumptions, including those prescribed by the Commission, such as future oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. The present value of future net cash flows referred to in this Form 10 K should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to the Companys properties. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, any such estimate is inherently an imprecise estimation of reserve quantities and estimated future net revenue therefrom. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will vary from those assumed in the estimate. Any significant variance from the assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of the Companys reserves as compared to estimates set forth in this Form 10 K. The Companys production operations may be curtailed or suspended as a result of governmental requirements or price controls, mechanical difficulties or other circumstances beyond control of the Company. The Companys properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, these reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Need for Development and Acquisition of Additional Reserves. The Companys future success, as is generally the case in the industry, depends upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless the Company conducts successful exploration, development and exploitation activities on properties it currently owns or acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, the Companys proved reserves will decline. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, title issues and other factors. Such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. There can be no assurance that the Companys exploration and development projects will result in significant additional reserves or the Company will have success drilling productive wells at economically viable costs. Furthermore, while the Companys revenues may increase if prevailing oil and gas prices increase, the Companys finding costs for additional reserves could also increase. The Company intends to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of its oil and natural gas reserves. While the Company believes cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Companys existing bank credit facility should provide sufficient funds for its planned activities through the end of 1998, additional debt or equity financing may be required prior to such time or thereafter to fund further exploration, exploitation and development activities or future property acquisitions. No assurances can be given as to the availability or terms of any such additional financing that may be required or that financing will continue to be available to the Company. If such financing is not available, the Companys exploration, exploitation and development activities and future property acquisitions may be curtailed. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business". Risks of Hedging Transactions. In order to manage its exposure to price risks in the marketing of its oil and natural gas, the Company has in the past and expects to continue to enter into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of its expected production. These arrangements may include futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), fixed price delivery contracts and financial or commodity swaps. While intended to reduce the effects of volatility of the price of oil and natural gas, such transactions may limit potential gains by the Company if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose the Company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which (i) production is less than expected, (ii) there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for the Companys production 12 14 and the delivery point assumed in the hedging arrangement, (iii) the counterparties to the Companys future contracts fail to perform the contract, or (iv) a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices. Dependence on Key Personnel. The Company depends to a large extent on the services of Floyd C. Wilson and W. Mark Womble. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Womble devote their full time to the Company. The Company has an employment contract with Mr. Wilson that expires in August 2000 and with Mr. Womble that expires in September 1999. The unavailability of Mr. Wilson or Mr. Womble would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes its success is also dependent upon its ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business". Marketability of Production. The marketability of the Companys production depends upon the availability and capacity of gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, and the unavailability or lack of capacity thereof could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. In addition, Federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect the Companys ability to produce and market its oil and natural gas on a profitable basis. Competition. The Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties, as well as the equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate such properties. The Company also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas to marketers and end users. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those of the Company. Drilling Risks. Drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions, and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. There can be no assurance as to the success of the Companys future drilling activities. Operating Hazards. The oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. In accordance with customary industry practice, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. There can be no assurance any insurance obtained by the Company will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. The Company cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. Compliance with Governmental Regulations. Oil and gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations which may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling and abandonment bonds or other financial responsibility requirements, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of oil and gas, by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management. 13 15 No Dividends. The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain its cash for the continued development of its business, including development, exploration and acquisition activities. In addition, the Companys bank credit facility currently restricts the ability of the Company to pay dividends. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business". ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The location and character of the Companys oil and gas properties and its gathering facilities are described above under Item 1. Business. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is a named defendant in lawsuits and is a party in governmental proceedings from time to time arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such lawsuits and other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW GENERAL Hugoton Energy Corporation was formed in 1987 through the acquisition of several limited partnership interests in the Hugoton Producing Area, and until 1993 grew primarily through acquisitions in that core area. Since 1993, the Company has grown through producing property and leasehold acquisitions and development and exploratory drilling, primarily in three additional core areas: the Williston Basin, the Permian Basin and, most recently, the Austin Chalk Trend. Expansion into these areas marked a shift in the Companys asset base from the lower risk, limited upside of the Hugoton Producing Area to areas with much greater exploration and development potential. 1997 Activity: On November 12, 1997, the Company signed a definitive agreement to merge in a stock for stock transaction with Chesapeake Energy Corporation. The merger agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio of 1.3 shares of Chesapeake upon consummation of the merger. On February 17, 1998, the Company and Chesapeake filed with the Securities an Exchange Commission a Joint Proxy/Prospectus on Form S 4 detailing the merger transaction to be voted on by shareholders on March 10, 1998. On March 10, 1998, the shareholders of the Company and Chesapeake voted to approve the merger. 1996 Acquisitions and Property Sales. During 1996, the Company spent $17.4 million to acquire 165,000 additional net undeveloped acres, including 95,000 net acres in the Williston Basin. These acreage additions were equal to 70% of the Companys net undeveloped acres at December 31, 1995. On June 20, 1996, the Company purchased a 50% working interest in approximately 95,000 gross acres in the Austin Chalk Trend in Louisiana for $12.9 million. This acreage acquisition, coupled with the January 1, 1996 acreage acquisition mentioned below and several smaller acreage acquisitions in the third quarter, provided the Company with a total of 148,000 gross acres in the Austin Chalk Trend to explore as of December 31, 1996. During 1996, the Company sold its interest in a group of non strategic producing gas properties and a gas gathering and salt water disposal system located in Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico to a major oil company for $4.5 million. The Company also sold its interest in approximately 450 non strategic producing oil properties located in Northeast Oklahoma for $1.5 million. On January 1, 1996, the Company purchased an undivided interest in a group of producing oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage for $9.7 million from a privately held company that owns an undivided interest in and operates the properties. The producing properties and acreage are located in Southeast Texas and established a presence for the Company in the Austin Chalk Trend. The acquisition included eight 16 18 producing wells and 35,000 gross acres, in which the Companys working interests are 25% and 50%, respectively. Prior Major Property Acquisitions. The Companys current property position has been shaped by two large acquisitions consummated in 1995 and 1993 and several smaller acquisitions. In September 1995, the Company acquired COG, a privately owned oil and gas company for $35 million in cash and 9.1 million shares of common stock. The acquisition extended the Companys operations into several basins outside the Hugoton Producing Area, primarily into the Williston Basin and Permian Basin. In July 1993, the Company significantly strengthened its position as a major operator in the Hugoton Field with the $73.5 million purchase of interests in two limited partnerships formed to acquire and develop properties in the Hugoton Producing Area for which the Company had acted as general partner. These two acquisitions were supplemented by a $13.6 million acquisition of 56 producing wells in the Hugoton Producing Area from Mobil Corporation in 1995, as well as the purchase in 1994 of a 50% interest in 186,000 mineral acres covering deep rights underlying shallow production located in the Hugoton Field which is being developed jointly with Oxy U.S.A. The future results of the Company may depend on its ability to locate and develop additional oil and natural gas properties, to attract and employ new sources of capital, to develop these properties and to successfully market the resulting production of crude oil and natural gas products. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future but it is impossible as to predict these future price movements. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the Companys cash flow, liquidity and profitability. Due to the nature of the oil and natural gas industry and the general risks relating to the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including the volatility of prices for crude oil and natural gas products, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the Companys oil and natural gas production during the periods indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 1996 1995 NET PRODUCTION:(1) Natural gas (MMcf)..................................... 19,269 19,026 14,651 Oil (MBbls)............................................ 1,677 1,700 1,018 Natural gas equivalents (MMcfe)........................ 29,331 29,226 20,759 AVERAGE SALES PRICE(2)(3): Natural gas ($/Mcf).................................... $ 2.24 $ 1.87 $ 1.30 Oil ($/Bbl)............................................ 19.36 18.03 16.37 Natural gas equivalents ($/Mcfe)....................... 2.58 2.27 1.72 OTHER DATA: Production costs ($/Mcfe)(4)........................... $ 0.88 $ 0.74 $ 0.56 Depreciation, depletion and amortization ($/Mcfe)(5)... 1.17 0.76 0.68 (1) Net production excludes NGLs and natural gas purchased by AmGas Corporation and resold to third parties. (2) Includes the effect of hedging transactions. See Note 11 of the Companys Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Average prices received from sales of natural gas include revenues attributable to NGLs as the Company has not historically accounted separately for production or revenues attributable to NGLs.

(5) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization not related to oil and gas properties. 17 19 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 Net Income or Loss and Cash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company reported net loss of $42.5 million, or $2.15 per share, on total revenue of $76.7 million. This compares to net income of $4.2 million, or $.21 per share, on total revenue of $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. Cash flows from operating activities for 1997 increased 11% to $32.6 million from $29.5 million in 1996. The net loss for 1997 is largely attributable to the non cash oil and gas properties impairment charge of $36.2 million, $12.0 million of undeveloped acreage impairment and abandonments and $5.2 million of exploratory 3 D seismic costs (all amounts pre tax). The Companys net income, cash flows and average sales prices for 1997 were impacted by the Companys oil and natural gas swap contracts, resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per Mcfe being increased by $1.3 million and $.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1997. Oil and Gas Revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations increased by 14% to $75.7 million in 1997, compared to $66.3 million during 1996. The increase from 1996 to 1997 is attributed to slightly higher average sales prices per Mcfe ($2.58 in 1997 versus $2.27 in 1996) and the existence of positive hedging gains of $1.3 million in 1997 versus hedging losses of $8.7 million in 1996. Production Expense. Production expense for 1997 increased to $25.7 million compared to $21.7 million in 1996. Lease operating costs, which rose $3.9 million, continued to reflect increasing price pressures in the service and supply sector of the economy. Exploration Expense. Exploration expense increased $18.6 million from $1.7 million in 1996 to $20.3 million in 1997. Undeveloped acreage impairment and abandonments of $12.0 million, $5.2 million of exploratory 3 D seismic costs and an increase in delay rentals of $1.4 million over 1996 comprised the 1997 increase. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased to $10.0 million in 1997 compared to $6.9 million in 1996. The increase for 1997 is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Companys review of strategic alternatives, consummating in the Merger Agreement signed November 12, 1997. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") for 1997 was $35.6 million compared to $23.4 million for 1996. The Companys DD&A expense per Mcfe increased from $.76 in 1996 to $1.17 in 1997. The higher rate per Mcfe is attributed to: 1) the impact of lower commodity prices at December 31, 1997 on the Companys oil and gas reserves and 2) higher than anticipated drilling costs incurred, primarily associated with the Companys Austin Chalk Properties. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties. During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recorded a $36.2 million non cash impairment charge related to its oil & gas properties. The charge is attributed to the impact of lower commodity prices at December 31, 1997 on the Companys oil and gas reserves and higher than anticipated drilling costs incurred, primarily associated with the Companys Austin Chalk Properties. The impairment charge was significantly impacted by substantial decreases of commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 1997. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $6.8 million for 1997 compared to $6.1 million for 1996. This increase is attributable to a higher average long term debt balance outstanding during 1997. Income Taxes. For 1997, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $16.1 million compared to a $3.3 million provision recorded in 1996. The effective tax rate for 1997 was 28% as compared to 44% in 1996. The income tax benefit recorded in 1997 is lower than an expected statutory tax rate primarily as a result of a $5.4 million valuation allowance recorded against the Companys deferred tax assets and the amortization of certain non deductible property costs arising from the purchase allocation related to the COG acquisition. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 Net Income or Loss and Cash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company reported net income of $4.2 million, or $.21 per share, on total revenue of $68.2 million. This 18 20 compares to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $.27 per share, on total revenue of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. Cash flows from operating activities for 1996 increased by 159% to $29.4 million from $11.4 million in 1995. The increase in net income for 1996 is largely attributable to a full year impact of the addition of the properties acquired in the COG acquisition completed in September of 1995, higher average sales prices per Mcfe ($2.27 in 1996 versus $1.72 in 1995) and the continued success of the Companys drilling program. The Companys net income, cash flows and average sales prices for 1996 were all significantly impacted by the Companys oil and natural gas swap contracts, resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per Mcfe being reduced by $8.7 million and $.30, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1996. Oil and Gas Revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations increased by 85% to $66.3 million in 1996, compared to $35.9 million during 1995. The increase from 1995 to 1996 is largely attributed to the inclusion of the COG and other acquisition properties for the full year in 1996, higher average sales prices and the continued success of the Companys drilling activities. The Companys 1996 gas production increased by 30% and oil production increased by 67% over 1995 production. Production Expense. Production expense for 1996 increased to $21.7 million compared to $11.6 million in 1995. The overall increase reflects the addition of a substantial number of wells (through the COG and other acquisitions and the Companys drilling program), and the per unit increase in production expenses reflects an increase in the oil component of the Companys production, which is relatively higher cost than gas production. Exploration Expense. Exploration expense decreased by $.5 million from $2.2 million in 1995 to $1.7 million in 1996. The decrease was due largely to the higher success rate achieved by the Company from its drilling program (87% in 1996 versus 72% in 1995). General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased to $6.9 million in 1996 compared to $4.3 million in 1995. This increase reflected the impact of a full year of expenses subsequent to the acquisition of COG and the continued expansion of the Companys operations. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") for 1996 was $23.4 million compared to $15.2 million for 1995. The Companys DD&A expense per Mcfe increased from $.68 in 1995 to $.76 in 1996. These increases are mainly due to higher production levels in 1996 compared to 1995 and the result of increased DD&A rates resulting from the adjustment of such rates to incorporate the book allocated basis to proved oil and gas properties acquired from COG, which bear a higher unit of production DD&A rate than the Companys other producing properties. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $6.1 million for 1996 compared to $5.1 million for 1995. This increase is attributable to a higher average long term debt balance outstanding during 1996, principally as a result of funding the COG and other acquisitions. Income Taxes. For 1996, the Company recorded a tax provision of $3.3 million compared to a $1.4 million benefit recorded in 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 was 44.1% as compared to 28.3% in 1995. The provision recorded in 1996 exceeds a normal tax rate primarily as a result of the amortization of certain non deductible property costs arising from the purchase allocation related to the COG acquisition. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys working capital position decreased $6.9 million from year end 1996 to $1.7 million at December 31, 1997. Accounts receivable decreased $3.2 million. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1 to 1.0 at December 31, 1997 and 2.0 to 1.0 at December 31, 1996, impacted primarily by substantially lower oil and natural gas prices at December 31, 1997 and continued increasing prices pressures of production service and supply. 19 21 Capital Expenditures. The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness and working capital obligations. Funding for the Companys exploration and development activities and its working capital obligations is provided primarily by internally generated cash flow. The Company budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows and routinely adjusts the level of its capital expenditures in response to anticipated changes in cash flows. Capital Resources. The Companys capital resources consist of cash flow from operating activities and funds available under a credit facility. On September 7, 1995, the Company arranged a bank credit facility, simultaneously with the closing of the COG acquisition. The facility is an unsecured $250 million revolving credit agreement due September 7, 1999. The facility is provided by seven banks, led by Bank One, Texas as agent and Texas Commerce Bank National Association as co agent. The Borrowing Base, as defined in the loan agreement, is currently set at $135 million, and is subject to semi annual redetermination based upon an evaluation of the Companys oil and gas reserves. Outstanding borrowings were $110 million at December 31, 1997. The credit facility provides the option of borrowing at floating interest rates based on Bank Ones base rate or at a Eurodollar option based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3/4 of 1% to 1.25% per annum, depending on the outstanding loan balance. Interest is paid quarterly or at the end of each interest period. The Company also incurs a commitment fee of 1/4 of 1% on the unused portion of the Borrowing Base. In addition, the credit facility contains customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions on the payment of dividends in excess of 50% of the Companys annual net income, and requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. At December 31, 1997, the Company was a party to one interest rate swap agreement that was entered into on December 11, 1995 for $25 million in notional principal amount. The effect of this agreement is to provide the Company with an interest rate on $25 million in notional principal amount for the three year term of the agreement of 5.445% plus a margin of 3/4 of 1% to 1.25%. Under market conditions at December 31, 1997, the aggregate effective annual interest rate after giving effect to the swap agreement was 7.13%. The swap agreement was canceled on January 16, 1998. Over the term of the agreement, the swap reduced the Companys interest expense by $107,000. The Company has historically funded operations and capital spending programs with cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit facilities. The Company believes cash flow from operations and the borrowing availability under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital requirements for 1998. However, because future cash flows and the availability of financing are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production and the prices received for oil and natural gas, there can be no assurance the Companys capital resources will be sufficient to maintain currently planned levels of capital expenditures. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business." Hedging Transactions. With the objective of achieving more predictable revenues and cash flows and reducing the exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, the Company has entered into various hedging transactions with respect to both oil and natural gas. While use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. At December 31, 1997, the Company had no open swap agreements or other commodity hedge instruments. The Company continues to evaluate whether to enter into additional hedging transactions for 1998 and future years. In addition, the Company may determine from time to time to terminate its then existing hedging positions. (See Note 11 of the Companys Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Companys net income, cash flows and average sales prices for 1997 were all impacted by the Companys oil and natural gas swap contracts, resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per Mcfe being increased by $1.3 million and $.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1997. 20 22 INFLATION AND CHANGES IN PRICES The Companys revenues and the value of its oil and natural gas properties have and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices. The Companys ability to maintain current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the Companys ability to control or predict. As realized at December 31, 1997 depressed commodity prices significantly impacted the Companys operations with respect to the Companys oil and natural gas reserves and related carrying costs. Although certain of the Companys costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation, inflation did not have a significant effect on the Companys operations during 1997 or 1996. YEAR 2000 ISSUES The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in many existing computer systems as the millennium approaches. The "Year 2000" problem is pervasive; virtually every computer operation may be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to 00. The risk is that computer systems will not properly recognize sensitive information when the year changes to 2000. Systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail, resulting in business interruption. The Company has taken steps to identify, correct or reprogram (as necessary) and test its existing systems for Year 2000 compliance. The Company has determined that there is no material exposure to the Year 2000 issue, and believes that remaining Year 2000 issues can be mitigated without a significant potential effect on the Companys financial position. However, given the complexity of the Year 2000 issue, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to address the problem without costs and uncertainties that might affect future financial results or cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial conditions.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW GENERAL Hugoton Energy Corporation was formed in 1987 through the acquisition of several limited partnership interests in the Hugoton Producing Area, and until 1993 grew primarily through acquisitions in that core area. Since 1993, the Company has grown through producing property and leasehold acquisitions and development and exploratory drilling, primarily in three additional core areas: the Williston Basin, the Permian Basin and, most recently, the Austin Chalk Trend. Expansion into these areas marked a shift in the Companys asset base from the lower risk, limited upside of the Hugoton Producing Area to areas with much greater exploration and development potential. 1997 Activity: On November 12, 1997, the Company signed a definitive agreement to merge in a stock for stock transaction with Chesapeake Energy Corporation. The merger agreement provides for a fixed exchange ratio of 1.3 shares of Chesapeake upon consummation of the merger. On February 17, 1998, the Company and Chesapeake filed with the Securities an Exchange Commission a Joint Proxy/Prospectus on Form S 4 detailing the merger transaction to be voted on by shareholders on March 10, 1998. On March 10, 1998, the shareholders of the Company and Chesapeake voted to approve the merger. 1996 Acquisitions and Property Sales. During 1996, the Company spent $17.4 million to acquire 165,000 additional net undeveloped acres, including 95,000 net acres in the Williston Basin. These acreage additions were equal to 70% of the Companys net undeveloped acres at December 31, 1995. On June 20, 1996, the Company purchased a 50% working interest in approximately 95,000 gross acres in the Austin Chalk Trend in Louisiana for $12.9 million. This acreage acquisition, coupled with the January 1, 1996 acreage acquisition mentioned below and several smaller acreage acquisitions in the third quarter, provided the Company with a total of 148,000 gross acres in the Austin Chalk Trend to explore as of December 31, 1996. During 1996, the Company sold its interest in a group of non strategic producing gas properties and a gas gathering and salt water disposal system located in Southern Colorado and Northern New Mexico to a major oil company for $4.5 million. The Company also sold its interest in approximately 450 non strategic producing oil properties located in Northeast Oklahoma for $1.5 million. On January 1, 1996, the Company purchased an undivided interest in a group of producing oil and gas properties and undeveloped acreage for $9.7 million from a privately held company that owns an undivided interest in and operates the properties. The producing properties and acreage are located in Southeast Texas and established a presence for the Company in the Austin Chalk Trend. The acquisition included eight 16 18 producing wells and 35,000 gross acres, in which the Companys working interests are 25% and 50%, respectively. Prior Major Property Acquisitions. The Companys current property position has been shaped by two large acquisitions consummated in 1995 and 1993 and several smaller acquisitions. In September 1995, the Company acquired COG, a privately owned oil and gas company for $35 million in cash and 9.1 million shares of common stock. The acquisition extended the Companys operations into several basins outside the Hugoton Producing Area, primarily into the Williston Basin and Permian Basin. In July 1993, the Company significantly strengthened its position as a major operator in the Hugoton Field with the $73.5 million purchase of interests in two limited partnerships formed to acquire and develop properties in the Hugoton Producing Area for which the Company had acted as general partner. These two acquisitions were supplemented by a $13.6 million acquisition of 56 producing wells in the Hugoton Producing Area from Mobil Corporation in 1995, as well as the purchase in 1994 of a 50% interest in 186,000 mineral acres covering deep rights underlying shallow production located in the Hugoton Field which is being developed jointly with Oxy U.S.A. The future results of the Company may depend on its ability to locate and develop additional oil and natural gas properties, to attract and employ new sources of capital, to develop these properties and to successfully market the resulting production of crude oil and natural gas products. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future but it is impossible as to predict these future price movements. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the Companys cash flow, liquidity and profitability. Due to the nature of the oil and natural gas industry and the general risks relating to the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including the volatility of prices for crude oil and natural gas products, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. See also "Impact of Chesapeake Merger" as set forth under "Item 1. Business." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth the Companys oil and natural gas production during the periods indicated: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 1996 1995 NET PRODUCTION:(1) Natural gas (MMcf)..................................... 19,269 19,026 14,651 Oil (MBbls)............................................ 1,677 1,700 1,018 Natural gas equivalents (MMcfe)........................ 29,331 29,226 20,759 AVERAGE SALES PRICE(2)(3): Natural gas ($/Mcf).................................... $ 2.24 $ 1.87 $ 1.30 Oil ($/Bbl)............................................ 19.36 18.03 16.37 Natural gas equivalents ($/Mcfe)....................... 2.58 2.27 1.72 OTHER DATA: Production costs ($/Mcfe)(4)........................... $ 0.88 $ 0.74 $ 0.56 Depreciation, depletion and amortization ($/Mcfe)(5)... 1.17 0.76 0.68 (1) Net production excludes NGLs and natural gas purchased by AmGas Corporation and resold to third parties. (2) Includes the effect of hedging transactions. See Note 11 of the Companys Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Average prices received from sales of natural gas include revenues attributable to NGLs as the Company has not historically accounted separately for production or revenues attributable to NGLs. (4) Consists of lease operating expenses, production and severance taxes and gathering, transportation and other production expense. (5) Excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization not related to oil and gas properties. 17 19 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 Net Income or Loss and Cash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company reported net loss of $42.5 million, or $2.15 per share, on total revenue of $76.7 million. This compares to net income of $4.2 million, or $.21 per share, on total revenue of $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. Cash flows from operating activities for 1997 increased 11% to $32.6 million from $29.5 million in 1996. The net loss for 1997 is largely attributable to the non cash oil and gas properties impairment charge of $36.2 million, $12.0 million of undeveloped acreage impairment and abandonments and $5.2 million of exploratory 3 D seismic costs (all amounts pre tax). The Companys net income, cash flows and average sales prices for 1997 were impacted by the Companys oil and natural gas swap contracts, resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per Mcfe being increased by $1.3 million and $.05, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1997. Oil and Gas Revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations increased by 14% to $75.7 million in 1997, compared to $66.3 million during 1996. The increase from 1996 to 1997 is attributed to slightly higher average sales prices per Mcfe ($2.58 in 1997 versus $2.27 in 1996) and the existence of positive hedging gains of $1.3 million in 1997 versus hedging losses of $8.7 million in 1996. Production Expense. Production expense for 1997 increased to $25.7 million compared to $21.7 million in 1996. Lease operating costs, which rose $3.9 million, continued to reflect increasing price pressures in the service and supply sector of the economy. Exploration Expense. Exploration expense increased $18.6 million from $1.7 million in 1996 to $20.3 million in 1997. Undeveloped acreage impairment and abandonments of $12.0 million, $5.2 million of exploratory 3 D seismic costs and an increase in delay rentals of $1.4 million over 1996 comprised the 1997 increase. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased to $10.0 million in 1997 compared to $6.9 million in 1996. The increase for 1997 is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Companys review of strategic alternatives, consummating in the Merger Agreement signed November 12, 1997. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") for 1997 was $35.6 million compared to $23.4 million for 1996. The Companys DD&A expense per Mcfe increased from $.76 in 1996 to $1.17 in 1997. The higher rate per Mcfe is attributed to: 1) the impact of lower commodity prices at December 31, 1997 on the Companys oil and gas reserves and 2) higher than anticipated drilling costs incurred, primarily associated with the Companys Austin Chalk Properties. Impairment of Oil & Gas Properties. During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recorded a $36.2 million non cash impairment charge related to its oil & gas properties. The charge is attributed to the impact of lower commodity prices at December 31, 1997 on the Companys oil and gas reserves and higher than anticipated drilling costs incurred, primarily associated with the Companys Austin Chalk Properties. The impairment charge was significantly impacted by substantial decreases of commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 1997. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $6.8 million for 1997 compared to $6.1 million for 1996. This increase is attributable to a higher average long term debt balance outstanding during 1997. Income Taxes. For 1997, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $16.1 million compared to a $3.3 million provision recorded in 1996. The effective tax rate for 1997 was 28% as compared to 44% in 1996. The income tax benefit recorded in 1997 is lower than an expected statutory tax rate primarily as a result of a $5.4 million valuation allowance recorded against the Companys deferred tax assets and the amortization of certain non deductible property costs arising from the purchase allocation related to the COG acquisition. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 Net Income or Loss and Cash Flow from Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company reported net income of $4.2 million, or $.21 per share, on total revenue of $68.2 million. This 18 20 compares to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $.27 per share, on total revenue of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995. Cash flows from operating activities for 1996 increased by 159% to $29.4 million from $11.4 million in 1995. The increase in net income for 1996 is largely attributable to a full year impact of the addition of the properties acquired in the COG acquisition completed in September of 1995, higher average sales prices per Mcfe ($2.27 in 1996 versus $1.72 in 1995) and the continued success of the Companys drilling program. The Companys net income, cash flows and average sales prices for 1996 were all significantly impacted by the Companys oil and natural gas swap contracts, resulting in pre tax income and the average sales price per Mcfe being reduced by $8.7 million and $.30, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1996. Oil and Gas Revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations increased by 85% to $66.3 million in 1996, compared to $35.9 million during 1995. The increase from 1995 to 1996 is largely attributed to the inclusion of the COG and other acquisition properties for the full year in 1996, higher average sales prices and the continued success of the Companys drilling activities. The Companys 1996 gas production increased by 30% and oil production increased by 67% over 1995 production. Production Expense. Production expense for 1996 increased to $21.7 million compared to $11.6 million in 1995. The overall increase reflects the addition of a substantial number of wells (through the COG and other acquisitions and the Companys drilling program), and the per unit increase in production expenses reflects an increase in the oil component of the Companys production, which is relatively higher cost than gas production. Exploration Expense. Exploration expense decreased by $.5 million from $2.2 million in 1995 to $1.7 million in 1996. The decrease was due largely to the higher success rate achieved by the Company from its drilling program (87% in 1996 versus 72% in 1995). General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased to $6.9 million in 1996 compared to $4.3 million in 1995. This increase reflected the impact of a full year of expenses subsequent to the acquisition of COG and the continued expansion of the Companys operations. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") for 1996 was $23.4 million compared to $15.2 million for 1995. The Companys DD&A expense per Mcfe increased from $.68 in 1995 to $.76 in 1996. These increases are mainly due to higher production levels in 1996 compared to 1995 and the result of increased DD&A rates resulting from the adjustment of such rates to incorporate the book allocated basis to proved oil and gas properties acquired from COG, which bear a higher unit of production DD&A rate than the Companys other producing properties. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $6.1 million for 1996 compared to $5.1 million for 1995. This increase is attributable to a higher average long term debt balance outstanding during 1996, principally as a result of funding the COG and other acquisitions. Income Taxes. For 1996, the Company recorded a tax provision of $3.3 million compared to a $1.4 million benefit recorded in 1995. The effective tax rate for 1996 was 44.1% as compared to 28.3% in 1995. The provision recorded in 1996 exceeds a normal tax rate primarily as a result of the amortization of certain non deductible property costs arising from the purchase allocation related to the COG acquisition. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys working capital position decreased $6.9 million from year end 1996 to $1.7 million at December 31, 1997. Accounts receivable decreased $3.2 million. The Companys ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.1 to 1.0 at December 31, 1997 and 2.0 to 1.0 at December 31, 1996, impacted primarily by substantially lower oil and natural gas prices at December 31, 1997 and continued increasing prices pressures of production service and supply. 19 21 Capital Expenditures.
