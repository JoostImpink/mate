ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward Looking Statements This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical or current facts, including, without limitation, statements about our business strategy, plans, objectives and future prospects, are forward looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following: Our financial results have varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We may fail to meet analysts and investors expectations. We have historically experienced negative cash flows. A failure to maintain profitability and achieve consistent positive cash flows would have a significant adverse effect on our business, impair our ability to support our operations and adversely affect our liquidity. Holders of our 5% senior convertible notes may convert the senior convertible notes upon the occurrence of certain events prior to May 15, 2010, and at any time on or after May 15, 2010, and have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the senior convertible notes on November 15, 2010. There is no assurance that at the time of conversion or required repurchase, we will have the ability to satisfy the cash portion of any such conversion obligation or to make any such required repurchase. We may require additional private or public debt or equity financing. Such financing may only be available on disadvantageous terms, or may not be available at all. Any new financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. The indenture governing our 5% senior convertible notes contains a debt incurrence covenant that places restrictions on the amount and type of additional indebtedness that we can incur. The debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the indenture could restrict or impede our ability to incur additional debt, which in turn could impair our ability to support our operations, adversely affect our liquidity and threaten our ability to repay our debts when they become due. If we are unable to develop and generate additional demand for our products, serious harm could result to our business. We may not be competitive, and increased competition could seriously harm our business. Our strategy to sell new generation solutions may not be successful. We face risks related to product quality and performance claims and other litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with customers and our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We may face other claims and litigation in the future that could harm our business and impair our liquidity. Loss of key personnel or our failure to attract, train and retain additional personal could negatively affect our operating results and revenues and seriously harm our company. We face other risks indicated in Item 1A., Risk Factors, and in our other filings with the SEC. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control and, in many cases, we cannot accurately predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements. When used in this document, the words believes, plans, expects, anticipates, intends, continue, may, will, should or the negative of such terms and similar expressions as they relate to us, our customers or our management are intended to identify forward looking statements. 27 Table of Contents References in this report to the terms optimal and optimization and words to that effect are not intended to connote the mathematically optimal solution, but may connote near optimal solutions, which reflect practical considerations such as customer requirements as to response time, precision of the results and other commercial factors. Overview We are a provider of supply chain management solutions, including various supply chain solutions consisting of software and service offerings. We operate our business in one business segment. Supply chain management is the set of processes, technology and expertise involved in managing supply, demand and fulfillment throughout divisions within a company and with its customers, suppliers and partners. The goals of our solutions include increasing supply chain efficiency and enhancing customer and supplier relationships by managing variability, reducing complexity, improving operational visibility, increasing operating velocity and integrating planning and execution. Our offerings are designed to help customers better achieve the following critical business objectives: Visibility a clear and unobstructed view up and down the supply chain Planning supply chain optimization to match supply and demand considering system wide constraints Collaboration interoperability with supply chain partners and elimination of functional silos Control management of data and business processes across the extended supply chain Our application software is often bundled with other product offerings we provide such as business optimization and technical consulting, training, solution maintenance, software upgrades and development. Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and judgments related to the application of certain accounting policies. While we base our estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to our reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and (ii) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. We consider our policies for revenue recognition to be critical due to the continuously evolving standards and industry practice related to revenue recognition, changes to which could materially impact the way we report revenues. Accounting polices related to: allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred taxes, goodwill and intangible assets, loss contingencies, and restructuring charges are also considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. Critical accounting policies, and our procedures related to these policies, are described in detail below. Also, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 Reclassification of Certain Revenue and Expense in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services, which include assistance in implementation, integration, customization, maintenance, training and consulting. We recognize revenue for software and related services in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Certain Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as modified by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition, and SAB 103, Update of Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins. 28 Table of Contents Software Solutions Revenue. Recognition of software solutions revenue occurs under SOP 81 1 and under SOP 97 2, as amended. Software solutions revenue recognized under SOP 81 1 includes both fees associated with licensing of our products, as well as any fees received to deliver the licensed functionality (for example, the provision of essential services). Essential services involve customizing or enhancing the software so that the software performs in accordance with specific customer requirements. Arrangements accounted for under SOP 81 1 follow either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method. The percentage of completion method is used when the required services are quantifiable, based on the estimated number of labor hours necessary to complete the project, and under that method revenues are recognized using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion but is limited to revenue that has been earned by the attainment of any milestones included in the contract. We do not capitalize costs associated with services performed where milestones have not been attained. The completed contract method is used when the required services are not quantifiable, and under that method revenues are recognized only when we have satisfied all of our product and or service delivery obligations to the customer. Similar to the treatment of milestones, we do not capitalize or defer costs associated with services performed on contracts recognized under the completed contract method that have not been completed. Under SOP 97 2, software license revenues are generally recognized upon delivery, provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable. We evaluate each of these criteria as follows: Evidence of an arrangement: We consider a non cancelable agreement signed by the customer to be evidence of an arrangement. Delivery: Delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or, in the case of electronic delivery, the customer is given access to the licensed programs. Our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions. Fixed or determinable fee: We consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within our normal established practices. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable. Collection is deemed probable: We conduct a credit review for significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due. If we determine that collection is not probable, we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon receipt of cash. Based on our collections history in certain countries, we apply a cash basis recognition requirement for software solutions agreements in those countries. Revenue for software solution arrangements that include one or more additional elements (i.e., services and maintenance) to be delivered at a future date is generally recognized using the residual method as set forth in SOP 98 9. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element(s) is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as license revenue. If fair values have not been established for the undelivered element(s), all revenue associated with the arrangement is deferred until all element(s) have been delivered or the fair value of the undelivered elements has been determined. Fair value for an individual element within an arrangement may be established when that element, when contracted for separately, is priced in a consistent manner. Fair value for our maintenance and consulting services has been established based on our maintenance renewal rates and consulting billing rates, respectively. Arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products are accounted for as subscriptions and recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Software solution license fees from reseller arrangements are generally based on the sublicenses granted by the reseller and recognized when the license is sold to the end customer. Services Revenue. Services revenue is primarily derived from fees for implementation, integration, consulting and training services as well as fees received to customize or enhance a previously purchased licensed 29 Table of Contents product that result from arrangements negotiated and executed subsequent to the license arrangement. Also included is reimbursable expense revenue representing travel expenses incurred by our consultants and billed to our customers for reimbursement pursuant to a signed agreement. Services revenue is generally recognized when services are performed. Contractual terms may include the following payment arrangements: fixed fee, full time equivalent, milestone, and time and material. In order to recognize service revenue, the following criteria must be met: Signed agreement: The agreement must be signed by the customer. Fee is determinable: The signed agreement must specify the fees to be received for the services. Delivery has occurred: Delivery is substantiated by time cards and, where applicable, supplemented by an acceptance from the customer that milestones as agreed in the statement of work have been met. Collectibility is probable: We conduct a credit review for significant transactions at the time of the engagement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer. We monitor collections over the term of each project, and if a customer becomes delinquent, the revenue may be deferred. Maintenance Revenue. Maintenance revenue consists of fees generated by providing software maintenance, upgrades and support to customers, such as telephone support, new releases of software and updated user documentation. A customer typically prepays maintenance and support fees for an initial period, and the related revenue is deferred and generally recognized over the term of such initial period. Maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter. Rates for maintenance, including subsequent renewal rates, are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the contract. Contract Revenue. Contract revenue consists of fees generated from license, services and maintenance revenue attributable to those transactions for which we determined to change the accounting from revenue recognition under SOP 97 2 to contract accounting under SOP 81 1 in connection with the 2003 restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the first three quarters of 2002. As of December 31, 2006, $3.2 million of contract revenue remained on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. Royalties and Affiliate Commissions. Royalties paid for third party software products integrated with our technology are expensed when the products are shipped. Commissions payable to affiliates in connection with sales assistance are generally expensed when the commission becomes payable. Accrued royalties payable totaled $2.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, while accrued affiliate commissions payable totaled $1.1 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Concurrent Transactions. We occasionally enter into transactions which are concluded at or about the same time as other arrangements with the same customer. These concurrent transactions are accounted for under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non monetary Transactions, as interpreted by EITF 01 02 Interpretations of APB Opinion No. 29. Generally, the recognition of a gain or loss on the exchange is measured based on the fair value of the assets involved to the extent that the fair value can be reasonably determined. A transaction that is not a culmination of the earnings process is recorded based on the net book value of the asset relinquished. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is a reserve established through a provision for bad debts charged to expense and represents our best estimate of probable losses resulting from non payment of amounts recorded in the existing accounts receivable portfolio. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider our historical write off experience, accounts receivable aging reports, the credit worthiness of individual customers, economic conditions affecting specific customer industries and general economic conditions, among other factors. Should any of these factors change, our estimate of probable losses due to bad debts could also change, which could affect the level of our future provisions for bad debts. 30 Table of Contents Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent estimated future tax amounts attributable to the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. These estimates are computed using the tax rates in effect for the applicable period. Realization of our deferred tax assets is, for the most part, dependent upon our U.S. consolidated tax group of companies having sufficient federal taxable income in future years to utilize our domestic net operating loss carry forwards before they expire. We adjust our deferred tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis in light of certain factors, including our financial performance. Goodwill. On January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, we ceased amortizing goodwill and adopted a new policy for measuring goodwill for impairment. No goodwill impairment was recorded in conjunction with the adoption of the new accounting standard. Under our policy, we test for impairment once annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit is below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price. The excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill. As stated above, we currently operate as a single reporting unit and all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company. Accordingly, we generally assume that the minimum fair value of our single reporting unit is our market capitalization, which is the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding and (ii) the market price of our common stock. Stock based compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) to account for our stock based compensation plans, including restricted stock, and our employee stock purchase plan, which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in our statement of operations. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights pursuant to our stock plans and the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the Black Scholes stock valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the award and expected stock price volatility. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based upon our closing stock price on the grant date. The expense calculated, based on the valuation model or on the closing stock price, is reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate. Loss Contingencies. There are times when non recurring events occur that require management to consider whether an accrual for a loss contingency is appropriate. Accruals for loss contingencies typically relate to certain legal proceedings, customer and other claims and litigation. As required by SFAS No. 5, we determine whether an accrual for a loss contingency is appropriate by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our legal proceedings, warranty and other claims and litigation based on available information to assess potential liability. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The adverse resolution of any one or more of these matters over and above the amounts that have been estimated and accrued in the current consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. 31 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges. We recognize restructuring charges consistent with applicable accounting standards. We reduce charges for obligations on leased properties with estimated sublease income. Furthermore, we analyze current market conditions, including current lease rates in the respective geographic regions, vacancy rates and costs associated with subleasing, when evaluating the reasonableness of future sublease income. The accrual for office closure and consolidation is an estimate that assumes certain facilities will be subleased or the underlying leases will otherwise be favorably terminated prior to the contracted lease expiration date. Significant subjective judgment and estimates must be made and used in calculating future sublease income. While the current accrual represents our best estimate of our expected costs to exit these obligations, variances between our expected and actual sublease income may result in significant restructuring charge adjustments in future periods. Discontinued Operations. On July 1, 2005, we completed the sale of Trade Service Corporation (TSC), which had been operated as a part of our content and data services business, for approximately $3.0 million. This transaction led to a gain on sale, net of write offs of associated assets and liabilities, of approximately $2.2 million. The sale was to a group of investors led by TSCs then current management team. On December 1, 2005 and December 16, 2005, respectively, the company and i2 Technologies Software Private Limited, an India corporation and a subsidiary of the company, sold to IHS Parts Management, Inc. (IHS) certain assets associated with our subsidiarys content and data services business (CDS). In addition, we agreed to license certain software and patents associated with the CDS business to IHS. IHS paid us approximately $30 million in cash and assumed certain liabilities associated with the CDS business. As part of the transaction, IHS agreed to sublease certain office space located in India from our subsidiary. In addition, we agreed to perform certain transition and hosting services for IHS to assist in the transition of CDS to IHS. The historical operating results of TSC and CDS, including the gain on the sale of TSC, have been reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Income from discontinued operations was $43.9 million in 2005 and $3.4 million in 2004. See Note 15 Discontinued Operations in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The analysis presented below excludes all revenues and expenses from discontinued operations. Revenues We derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services, which include assistance in implementation, integration, customization, training, consulting and maintenance. We recognize revenue for software and related services in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 81 1, Accounting for Certain Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as modified by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. The following table sets forth revenues and the percentages of total revenues of selected items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The year to year comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

These revenue changes are discussed below. Software Solutions. Software solutions revenue includes core license revenue, recurring license revenue, and fees received to develop the licensed functionality. We recognize these revenues under SOP 97 2 or SOP 81 1 based on our evaluation of whether the associated services are essential to the licensed software as described within SOP 97 2. If the services are considered essential, revenue is generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis under SOP 81 1. Services are considered essential to the software when they involve significant modifications or additions to the software features and functionality. We also have several subscription and other recurring revenue transactions which are recognized ratably over the life of each contract. Software solutions revenue recognized under SOP 97 2 decreased $5.8 million, or 22%, in 2006 and increased $7.7 million, or 42%, in 2005. We have experienced variability in the timing of recognition of revenue from software solutions under SOP 97 2 and we expect this variability to continue. Variability is caused by the timing and amount of software solutions bookings, and whether the software solutions require essential services. Variability is also caused by the timing of cash receipts for arrangements where significant uncertainty exists regarding collectibility of license fees. Software solutions revenue recognized under SOP 81 1 decreased $21.5 million, or 49%, in 2006 and increased $23.0 million, or 110%, in 2005. Software solutions revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 included $13.8 million of revenue recognized upon the achievement of significant contractual milestones on separate agreements and $8.5 million of revenue related to an agreement with Shell Global Solutions International B.V. We have also experienced variability in the timing of recognition of revenue from software solutions under SOP 81 1 and expect this variability to continue. Since the majority of the SOP 81 1 revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis, our revenue is highly dependent on the amount of prior period bookings in our backlog, our progress toward completion of the development and delivery of licensed features and functionality, including the achievement of contractual milestones, and cash receipts for arrangements where significant uncertainty exists regarding collectibility of fees. Another source of variability for software solutions revenue is the mix of products included in our bookings. We are focused on selling new generation solutions, where there is a high likelihood of providing essential services associated with the new products. Accordingly, the license fees received for these arrangements, together with fees for the essential services, will be recognized under SOP 81 1 over the period in which the services are performed instead of being recognized upon delivery of the software. Revenue from recurring items increased $13.6 million, or 67%, in 2006 and $5.1 million, or 33%, in 2005. Included in the 2006 increase was $10.5 million of revenue recognized from $10.5 million in platform technology bookings in the second quarter of 2006. Recurring items include revenue from our supply chain leader and other subscription transactions, for which the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual term of the transaction. Recurring revenue related to supply chain leader transactions for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was $12.4 million. These supply chain leader transactions have varying lives and begin expiring in the second quarter of 2007. Services. Services revenue is primarily derived from fees for implementation, integration, consulting and training services and is generally recognized when services are performed. In addition, service revenue includes fees received from arrangements to customize or enhance previously purchased licensed software. Services revenue also includes reimbursable expense revenue, with the related costs of reimbursable expenses included in cost of services. Services revenue increased $2.7 million, or 3%, in 2006 and decreased $14.9 million, or 13%, during 2005. The increase in 2006 reflects growth in the average number of services personnel during the second half of 2006, when compared to the comparable period in 2005, as we attempted to match the levels of services personnel with 33 Table of Contents the market demand for our services. The decrease in 2005 was primarily related to lower average headcount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This lower average headcount in 2005, compared to 2004, is reflective of a lower volume of license sales, which led to fewer implementations. Our volume of upgrade projects also declined as many of our customers had migrated to newer versions of our projects. Based on our historical trends, we expect services revenue to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of booking new projects and the timing of revenue recognition on these projects. In any period, services revenue is dependent upon a variety of factors, including: The number and value of services transactions booked during the current and preceding periods The number and availability of services resources actively engaged on billable projects The timing of milestone acceptance for engagements contractually requiring customer sign off, and The timing of cash payments when collectibility is uncertain Maintenance. Maintenance revenue decreased $7.8 million, or 8%, in 2006 and $16.2 million, or 14%, in 2005. The decrease in maintenance revenue during 2006 and 2005 resulted from a continuing decline in both the number and dollar amount of maintenance renewals, mainly due to cost cutting efforts by our customers. In 2005, we also experienced lower volumes and dollar amounts of software solutions bookings, which contributed to the decrease in maintenance revenue in 2006 and 2005. In addition, we concluded four supply chain leader transactions in 2004, which are being recorded as subscription revenue. These transactions were executed with customers who were previously utilizing our software through perpetual license agreements with annual maintenance contracts. There can be no assurance that maintenance revenues will not continue to decline. Contract. Contract revenue consists of license, services, and maintenance revenue attributable to those transactions for which we determined to change the accounting from revenue recognition under SOP 97 2 to contract accounting under SOP 81 1 in connection with the 2003 restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the first three quarters of 2002. Contract revenue is not indicative of the current performance of our business, as it reflects the recognition of deferred revenues for which cash was collected in prior periods. Contract revenue decreased $38.4 million, or 90%, during 2006 and $30.4 million, or 42%, during 2005. The decrease in contract revenue during 2006 and 2005 was a result of the lower amount of remaining deferred contract revenue, the decreased number of deferred transactions and the occurrence of fewer events that allow the recognition of this revenue. As of December 31, 2006, the deferred contract revenue balance was $3.2 million, consisting of one transaction. International Revenue. Our international revenues, included in the categories discussed above, primarily are generated from customers located in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada. International revenue totaled $120.3 million, or 43% of total revenue, in 2006; $158.2 million, or 47% of total revenue, in 2005; and $144.8 million, or 40% of total revenue, in 2004. International revenue remained relatively consistent, as a percentage of total revenue, in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Customer Concentration. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of annual revenues in 2006, 2005 or 2004. 34 Table of Contents Costs of Revenues The following table sets forth cost of revenues and the gross margins of selected items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The year to year comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2006 GrossMargin Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2005 GrossMargin Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2004 GrossMargin Software solutions $ 12,862 83 % $ 14,720 84 % $ 20,137 63 % Services and maintenance 97,960 51 % 103,758 49 % 121,504 48 % Contract 311 92 % 1,575 96 % 4,718 94 % Amortization of acquired technology 21 369 Total cost of revenues $ 111,154 $ 120,053 $ 146,728 Cost of Software Solutions. Cost of software solutions consists of: Salaries and other related costs of employees who provide essential services to customize or enhance the software for the customer Commissions paid to non customer third parties in connection with joint marketing and other related agreements, which are generally expensed when they become payable Royalty fees associated with third party software utilized with our technology. Such royalties are generally expensed when the products are shipped; however, royalties associated with fixed cost arrangements are generally expensed over the period of the arrangement. The cost of user product documentation The cost of delivery of software Provisions for the estimated costs of servicing customer claims, which we accrue on a case by case basis Cost of software solutions decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, in 2006 and $5.4 million, or 27%, in 2005. The decreases in 2006 and in 2005 were due to renegotiated prepaid third party royalty agreements resulting in a lower expense run rate. Also included in cost of software solutions during 2004 was $2.3 million of costs related to a large project that involved a customer dispute. Cost of Services and Maintenance. Cost of services and maintenance includes expenses related to implementation, training, and customization and enhancement of previously licensed software solutions, as well as providing telephone support, upgrades and updated user documentation. The cost of services and maintenance decreased $5.8 million, or 6%, in 2006. The decrease in 2006 includes decreases in payroll related costs of $4.7 million, travel and entertainment of $2.0 million and subcontractors of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by non cash stock option expense of $2.7 million. Average services and maintenance headcount decreased 5% in 2006 when compared to 2005. The total cost of services and maintenance decreased $17.7 million, or 15% in 2005. The decrease in 2005 includes decreases in payroll related costs of $11.4 million, travel and entertainment of $4.1 million and contract labor of $1.4 million. Average services and maintenance headcount decreased 16% in 2005 when compared to 2004 which contributed to the reduction of payroll related costs. In addition, our increased utilization of India based personnel to provide services and maintenance support contributed to the decrease in this expense. Cost of Contract. Cost of contract decreased $1.3 million, or 80%, in 2006 and $3.1 million, or 67%, in 2005. Because contract expenses are recorded when the corresponding revenue is recognized, we expect cost of contract to vary. As of December 31, 2006, we had no remaining deferred contract costs. 35 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquired Technology. In connection with our business acquisitions, we acquired developed technology that we offer as a part of our solutions. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the amortization of acquired technology is included as a part of our cost of revenues because it relates to software products that are marketed to potential customers. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses and the percentages of total revenue for those operating expenses as reported in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The year to year comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results: Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2006 Percent ofTotalRevenue Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2005 Percent ofTotalRevenue Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2004 Percent ofTotalRevenue Sales and marketing $ 48,185 17 % $ 51,727 15 % $ 74,946 21 % Research and development 35,200 13 % 37,337 11 % 56,279 16 % General and administrative 56,129 20 % 61,117 18 % 71,646 20 % Amortization of intangibles 17 39 Restructuring charges and adjustments (403 ) 11,269 3 % 2,688 1 % Total operating expenses $ 139,128 $ 161,450 $ 205,598 Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, commissions, office facilities, travel, and promotional events such as trade shows, seminars, technical conferences, advertising and public relations programs. Sales and marketing expense decreased $3.5 million, or 7%, in 2006. The decrease in 2006 includes decreases in payroll related costs of $5.6 million and decreases in overhead costs of $1.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in non cash stock option expense of $3.5 million. Average sales and marketing staff decreased approximately 17% in 2006 when compared to 2005. Sales and marketing expense decreased $23.2 million, or 31%, in 2005. The decrease in expense includes decreases in payroll related costs of $12.7 million and decreases in travel and entertainment of $4.1 million. Average sales and marketing headcount decreased 34% in 2005 when compared to 2004. Lower headcount and lower levels of sales led to reduced commissions based on lower bookings. Research and Development Expense. Research and development expense consists of costs related to continued software development and product enhancements to existing software. Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, the establishment of technological feasibility of our products and general release of such software has substantially coincided. As a result, software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant; therefore, we have not capitalized any software development costs other than those recorded in connection with our acquisitions. Research and development expense decreased $2.1 million, or 6%, in 2006. This decrease in expense includes a decrease in overhead expense of $4.6 million, a decrease in facilities expense of $1.0 million, a decrease in communications expense of $0.4 million and a decrease in travel and entertainment expense of $0.4 million. These decreases in expense were partially offset by an increase in payroll related expense of $1.1 million and non cash stock option expense of $3.5 million. Research and development expense decreased $18.9 million, or 34%, in 2005. This decrease in expense includes decreases in payroll related expenses of $14.5 million, contractor expense of $1.3 million, and travel 36 Table of Contents and entertainment expense of $1.0 million. Average research and development headcount decreased 40% in 2005 when compared to 2004. In addition, our increased utilization of India based personnel to provide research and development support also contributed to the decrease in this expense in 2005. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expense includes the personnel and other costs of our finance, legal, accounting, human resources, information systems and executive departments, as well as external litigation costs. General and administrative expense decreased $5.0 million, or 8%, in 2006. This decrease reflects an accrual made in 2005 of approximately $10.0 million for the estimated settlement of certain outstanding contingent liabilities. In addition, payroll related expense decreased $3.1 million and facilities expense decreased $2.4 million in 2006. These decreases in the components of general and administrative expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense of $5.7 million and an increase in indemnification expense of $9.1 million. General and administrative expenses decreased $10.5 million, or 15%, in 2005. This decrease includes $9.2 million of payroll related costs and a decrease of $1.9 million of facilities expense. The decrease in payroll related expenses is related to a decrease of 16% in average general and administrative headcount as compared to 2004, partially offset by the increased cost of our executive department. Amortization of Intangible Assets and Impairment of Intangible Assets. From time to time, we have sought to enhance our product offerings through technology and business acquisitions. When an acquisition of a business is accounted for using the purchase method, the amount of the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, while goodwill is only written down when it is deemed to be impaired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we test goodwill for impairment annually. Impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2006 we performed a review for impairment of goodwill and concluded there was no evidence of impairment related to the goodwill balance of $14.8 million. Impairment testing was also conducted in 2005 and 2004 and no impairment was deemed necessary. Restructuring Charges SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146), requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. The statement applies to costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination. An exit activity includes but is not limited to a restructuring, which is defined as a program that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either (a) the scope of a business undertaken by an enterprise, or (b) the manner in which the business is conducted. In March 2004 we initiated a global workforce reduction plan to reduce our operating expenses and bring them in line with our revenue levels. In the first and second quarter of 2004, 163 employees were involuntarily terminated. During this period, severance costs of approximately $5.1 million were recorded related to the severance payments to be paid to the employees involuntarily terminated. In March 2005, we implemented a restructuring plan to resize our infrastructure and reduce our overhead to improve efficiencies and reduce operating expense. The restructuring included the involuntary termination of 184 employees and closing or partially vacating four office locations. During the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $10.4 million for the involuntary terminations and $2.1 million for the office closures. 37 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, an accrual of approximately $0.3 million, including $0.1 million related to our 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans, remained in accrued liabilities. Additional details of the restructuring charges and remaining accruals are presented in Note 11 Restructuring Charges and Adjustments in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Non operating Expense, Net Non operating expense, net, was as follows: Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2006 PercentChange Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2005 PercentChange Twelve MonthsEndedDecember 31,2004 Interest income $ 5,305 31 % $ 7,697 84 % $ 4,179 Interest expense (6,069 ) 63 % (16,315 ) 9 % (17,873 ) Realized gains on investments, net 475 95 % 10,144 12741 % 79 Foreign currency hedge and transaction losses, net (219 ) 95 % (4,217 ) 31 % (3,212 ) (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt 100 % (3,017 ) 236 % 2,223 Other expense, net (850 ) 45 % (1,547 ) 45 % (1,069 ) Total non operating expense, net $ (1,358 ) $ (7,255 ) $ (15,673 ) The decrease in interest income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of lower average balances of invested funds, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned on invested funds. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 as compared to 2005 is the result of lower debt levels. The decrease in realized gains on investments in 2006 as compared to 2005 is due to the sale of an investment in 2005 for approximately $11.0 million that was non recurring in nature. During 2006, foreign currency losses decreased due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2006 when compared to 2005, relative to our foreign currency positions, and improved hedge effectiveness. The increase in interest income in 2005 compared to 2004 was the result of higher market interest rates and cash balances. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to the repurchase of $51.0 million of our 5.25% convertible subordinated notes during the year. The repurchase, of the $51.0 million of our 5.25% convertible subordinated notes, together with the retirement of an additional $235.0 million of the notes on December 28, 2005, resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $3.0 million due to a 75 basis point call premium on the $235.0 million and the write off of $1.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The increase in realized gains on investments in 2005 compared to 2004 is due to the sale of an investment in 2005 for approximately $11.0 million that was non recurring in nature. Foreign currency losses increased $1.0 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The increased loss was due mainly to declining foreign currency exchange rates in 2005, relative to our foreign currency positions. The market interest rates on investments and the relative exchange values of foreign currencies are influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the governments in the countries in which we operate. The nature, timing and extent of any impact on our financial statements resulting from changes in those governments policies are not predictable. Risks associated with market interest rates and foreign exchange rates are discussed below under the section captioned Sensitivity to Market Risks. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $3.8 million and $4.7 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $0.7 million in 2004, representing effective income tax rates of 13.6% in 2006, 5.1% in 2005 and 33.3% in 2004. 38 Table of Contents The effective income tax rates during 2006, 2005 and 2004 differ from the U.S. statutory rate (35% for 2006 and 2005, and 34% for 2004) due to several factors. These factors include, among others, changes in our valuation allowance, the effect of foreign operations, state income taxes (net of federal income tax benefits), non deductible meals and entertainment, and research and development tax credits. The effect of these factors on the income tax rate is detailed in Note 13 Income Taxes in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of approximately $1.1 million against our foreign net deferred tax assets. Each quarter, we review the necessity and amounts of the domestic and foreign valuation allowances. Despite the valuation allowance, the future tax deductible benefits related to these deferred tax assets remain available to offset future taxable income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2006, we have recorded approximately $7.4 million in tax contingency reserves in our taxes payable accounts relating to tax positions we have taken during tax years that remain open for examination by tax authorities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at December 31, 2006. Total Less ThanOne Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (excluding restructured facilities) $ 36,242 $ 13,061 $ 19,211 $ 3,772 $ Operating leases for restructured facilities 2,529 981 619 619 310 Sub lease income related to non restructured facilities (112 ) (112 ) Sub lease income related to restructured facilities (2,314 ) (765 ) (619 ) (619 ) (310 ) Long term debt obligations (1) 124,523 4,313 8,625 8,625 102,961 Other purchase obligations (2) 13,489 11,793 1,696 Total $ 174,358 $ 29,271 $ 29,532 $ 12,397 $ 102,961 1 Included in the long term debt obligations are semi annual interest payments through December 15, 2015. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and maintenance obligations. The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital was $17.4 million at December 31, 2006, compared to a working capital deficiency of $34.3 million at December 31, 2005, a change of $51.7 million or 151%. The improvement resulted from a decrease in current liabilities of $65.8 million (primarily comprised of decreases of $25.8 million in deferred revenue, $25.0 million in the current portion of long term debt and $14.7 million in accrued liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in current assets of $14.1 million (primarily comprised of decreases of $10.0 million in other current assets and $3.5 million in cash and cash equivalents). 39 Table of Contents Our working capital balance at December 31, 2006 included deferred revenue. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $74.0 million of deferred revenue recorded as a current liability, representing pre paid revenue for all of our different revenue categories. Our deferred revenue balance includes a margin to be earned when it is recognized, so the conversion of the liability to revenue will require cash outflows that are less than the amount of the liability. Cash and cash equivalents were $109.4 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $112.9 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $3.5 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was the result of $14.8 million of cash provided by operating activities offset by $2.1 million of cash used in investing activities and $16.7 million of cash used in financing activities. Exchange rates had a positive impact on cash of $0.6 million. We had positive cash flow from operating activities of $14.8 million during 2006. Cash inflows included $10.5 million for platform technology licensing. We are pursuing other similar transactions, but there can be no assurance we will be successful at entering into additional platform technology transactions. Cash outflows for 2006 included $12.0 million of employees bonuses accrued in 2005 and $8.0 million for bonuses accrued during 2006, $4.0 million related to the settlement of our outstanding litigation with Kmart, and $3.8 million related to our 2006 director and officer insurance premium. We used approximately $2.1 million of cash in investing activities during 2006, including the purchase of premises and equipment of $2.4 million and a business acquisition of $0.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of $0.5 million from the sale of securities, $0.2 million from the disposal of premises and equipment and $0.1 million in decreases in restricted cash. We used approximately $16.7 million of cash in financing activities during 2006, including the $25.0 million repurchase of debt and the payment of $1.3 million of dividends on our Series B preferred stock. These uses of cash were partially offset by the issuance of an additional $7.5 million of our 5% senior convertible notes. We maintain a $15.0 million letter of credit line. We are charged fees of 0.375% per year on the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit and 0.15% per year on the average daily unused amount of the line. Under the line, we are required to maintain restricted cash in a depository account maintained by the lender to secure letters of credit issued in connection with the line. The line has no financial covenants and expires on December 15, 2008. As of December 31, 2006, $2.9 million in letters of credit were outstanding under this line and $4.0 million in restricted cash was pledged as collateral. We had $86.3 million in face value of our 5% senior convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2006. Holders of our senior convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of the senior convertible notes on November 15, 2010 and may convert the senior convertible notes at any time on or after May 15, 2010. In addition, holders of the senior convertible notes may convert the senior convertible notes prior to May 15, 2010 upon the occurrence of any of the following events: if the senior convertible notes have been called for redemption; upon certain dividends or distributions to all holders of our common stock; upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions constituting a fundamental change (the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading, each as defined in the indenture governing our senior convertible notes); if the average of the trading prices for the senior convertible notes during any five consecutive trading day period is less than 98% of the average of the conversion values for the senior convertible notes (the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate) during that period; or at any time after May 15, 2008 if the closing sale price of our common stock is equal to or greater than $23.21 for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. 40 Table of Contents Upon conversion of the senior convertible notes, we will be required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes to be converted in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock. The indenture governing the 5% senior convertible notes contains a debt incurrence covenant that places restrictions on the amount and type of additional indebtedness that we can incur. Such covenant specifies that we shall not, and that we shall not permit any of our subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, incur or guarantee or assume any indebtedness other than permitted indebtedness. Permitted indebtedness is defined in the indenture to include, among others, the following categories of indebtedness: (i) all indebtedness outstanding on November 23, 2005; (ii) indebtedness under the senior convertible notes; (iii) indebtedness under our $15.0 million letter of credit line; (iv) between $25.0 million and $50.0 million of additional senior secured indebtedness (the maximum permitted amount to be determined by application of a formula contained in the indenture); and (v) at least $100.0 million of additional subordinated indebtedness (the maximum permitted amount to be determined by application of a formula contained in the indenture). We experienced negative cash flows during the quarter ended September 30, 2006, the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and each of the five years ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to sharp declines in our revenues and our historical inability to reduce our expenses to a level at or below the level of our revenues. We may be required to seek private or public debt or equity financing in order to support our operations, satisfy the conversion obligation with respect to our senior convertible notes and or repay our senior convertible notes. The debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the indenture governing our senior convertible notes could restrict or impede our ability to incur additional debt. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. Sensitivity to Market Risks Foreign Currency Risk. Revenues originating outside of the United States totaled 43%, 47% and 40% of total revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Since we conduct business on a global basis in various foreign currencies, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a foreign currency hedging program that utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge various nonfunctional currency exposures. The objective of this program is to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. Furthermore, our goal is to offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded for accounting purposes with gains and losses realized on the forward contracts. Our hedging activities cannot completely protect us from the risk of foreign currency losses as our currency exposures are constantly changing and not all of these exposures are hedged. Details of our foreign currency risk management program are presented in Note 12 Foreign Currency Risk Management in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk. Our investments are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments, including bank time deposits, money market funds and taxable and tax exempt variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations, municipalities and local, state and national governmental entities and agencies. These investments are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are primarily operating balances and are generally invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank. Due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio, these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board influences the general direction of market interest rates in the U.S. where the majority of our cash and investments are held. The Federal Reserve Board increased the discount rate by 100 basis points between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted average yield on time 41 Table of Contents deposits and debt securities we held was 5.18% compared to 3.70% for time deposits and debt securities held as of December 31, 2005. If overall interest rates fall by 100 basis points in 2007, our interest income will decline approximately $1.1 million, assuming investment levels consistent with December 31, 2006 levels. Credit Risk. Financial assets that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of investments and accounts receivable. Cash on deposit is held with financial institutions with high credit standings. Debt security investments are generally in highly rated corporations and municipalities as well as agencies of the U.S. government; however, a significant portion of these investments are in corporate debt securities, which carry a higher level of risk compared to municipal and U.S. government backed securities. Our customer base consists of large numbers of geographically diverse enterprises dispersed across many industries. As a result, concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is not significant. However, we periodically perform credit evaluations for most of our customers and maintain reserves for potential losses. In certain situations we may seek letters of credit to be issued on behalf of some customers to mitigate our exposure to credit risk. We currently use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with receivables denominated in foreign currencies. Risk of non performance by counterparties to such contracts is minimal due to the size and credit standings of the financial institutions involved. Market Price Risk. We maintain minority equity investments in various publicly traded companies for business and strategic purposes. The remaining carrying value of minority equity investments was zero at December 31, 2006. We also invested in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages or may no longer be viable or operational. As a result of significant declines in the expected realizable amounts of these investments, in previous periods we wrote off the book value of most of these investments as the decline in fair value was considered other than temporary. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we wrote off the book value of our $1.0 million investment in Integrated Development Enterprise, Inc. (IDe) preferred stock. This investment was initially made during 2005 in connection with the employment of our CEO, Michael McGrath. See Note 16 Related Party Transactions in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation. Inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements.
