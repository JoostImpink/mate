ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K which express that we believe, anticipate, expect or plan to as well as other statements which are not historical fact, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As such, actual events or results may differ materially as a result of the risks and uncertainties described herein and elsewhere including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Risk Factors set forth in Part I of this Report as well as other risks and uncertainties in the documents incorporated herein by reference. Overview We are a multi business medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets minimally invasive surgical products, many of which are based on our patented Coblation&reg; technology. We currently market minimally invasive surgical products across three core business units ArthroCare Sports Medicine, ArthroCare Spine, and ArthroCare Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) but also have developed, manufactured and marketed Coblation based and complementary products for application in neurology, cosmetic surgery, urology and gynecology, with research continuing in additional areas. In each of our core business units we are focused on driving the application of enabling technologies, primarily for plasma based soft tissue removal, and increasing the number of minimally invasive procedures being performed. In December 1995, we introduced our Arthroscopy System commercially in the United States and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system. Our strategy includes placing controller units, which enable use of our disposable Coblation products, at substantial discounts or placing controllers at customer sites at no cost in order to generate future disposable product revenue. Our strategy also includes applying our patented Coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets, including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery, neurosurgery, gynecology, urology, cosmetic surgery, ENT surgery, cardiology and general surgery. We cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to 510(k) applications or that the applications will be cleared by the FDA on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that the products, if cleared for marketing, will ever achieve commercial acceptance. In May 1998, we announced that we had entered the ear, nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called ENTec to commercialize Coblation technology in this field. In September 1999, we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market. In February 2000, we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery. We are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide. In January 2004, we acquired MDA and its majority owned subsidiary, Parallax, a business focused on the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. In November 2004, we acquired Opus Medical, a business focused on soft tissue to bone repair systems, including systems for the treatment of rotator cuff injuries. In August 2005, we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Applied Therapeutics, Inc., or ATI, a maker of sinus surgery treatment products. We have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market several of our products and several of our products are CE marked, which is a requirement to sell our products in most of Western Europe. Specifically, we have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our Coblation based Arthroscopic Surgery System, or Arthroscopic System, for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee, shoulder, ankle, elbow, wrist and hip. In addition, our Arthroscopic System is CE marked for use in arthroscopic surgery. We have also received 510(k) 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements clearances in the United States and a CE mark in Europe to market and sell our Coblation based Spinal Surgery System for spinal surgery and neurosurgery. Our ENT Surgery System has received 510(k) clearances from the FDA and a CE mark for use in general head, neck, oral and sinus surgery procedures, including tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, turbinate reduction to relieve nasal obstruction, and soft palate stiffening to treat snoring. The FDA also has cleared our Cosmetic Surgery System for general dermatologic procedures and skin resurfacing in connection with wrinkle reduction procedures. In addition, the Cosmetic Surgery System has received a CE Mark. We also have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, and applied for a CE mark, to market products based on our Coblation technology for use in urology, gynecology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, orthopedic surgery and general surgery. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize product revenue after shipment of our products to customers has occurred, any acceptance terms have been fulfilled, no significant contractual obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is reported net of a provision for estimated product returns. We recognize license fee and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process. Royalties are recognized as earned, generally based on the licensees product shipments. These items are classified as royalties, fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. Amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling costs have also been classified as royalties, fees and other revenues and related costs are classified as cost of product sales in the accompanying statements of operations. Additionally, we assess risks of loss on accounts receivable and make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment. In estimating this allowance, we consider factors such as historical collection experience, a customers current credit worthiness, customer concentrations, the age of the receivable balance, both individually and in the aggregate, and general economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay. Actual customer collections could differ from our estimates. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.7 million at December 31, 2006 is adequate to provide for probable losses associated with accounts receivable. Inventory Allowance Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts. We record an allowance against our inventory value to the extent we believe that demand for certain inventory items has decreased or if certain inventory items have become obsolete. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Business Combinations Accounting for our business acquisitions requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between net tangible assets, in process research and development, other identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (FAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We currently have recorded goodwill related to our acquisitions of ATI, Atlantech, MDA and Opus Medical. We have accumulated goodwill of $137.8 million and other intangible assets of $36.0 million as of December 31, 2006. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models and by comparing our reporting units to guideline publicly traded companies. These methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit. We estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors. The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal 2006, indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date. Accordingly, we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We will continue to monitor our goodwill balance and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present. There are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but each reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of each asset. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. To date, we have not had an impairment associated with these intangible assets. In connection with the Opus and ATI acquisitions, we made significant estimates of $36.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to the valuation of purchased in process research and development (IPR&D) projects. Our policy defines IPR&D as the value assigned to those projects which have no alternative future use, including those for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility or have not received regulatory approval. Determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D requires significant estimates. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D is determined by estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition, in accordance with accepted valuation methods, and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility. Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. In determining loss contingencies, we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accrual estimates should be adjusted. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method, whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using the tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. It is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized. This would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made. In addition, we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested (as that term is defined in generally accepted accounting principles). While we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, facts and circumstances can change in the future, and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances, such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries, could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. In such an event, we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental U.S. income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the U.S. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) based on estimated grant date fair values. Stock based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $9.8 million. Stock based compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards and non employee stock options for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively. There was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Upon adoption of FAS 123R, we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black Scholes model, as we had previously used for the purpose of disclosing pro forma financial information. The determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behavior, and related tax implications associated with relocating administrative functions to Austin, Texas. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The weighted average fair value of stock awards, excluding restricted stock, granted for year ended December 31, 2006 was $15.39 per share and $6.79 per share for the ESPP, using the Black Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions: Year ended December 31, 2006 Options ESPP Expected term (in years) (1) 3.8 0.5 Expected volatility (2) 36 % 35 % Risk free interest rate (3) 4.7 % 5.2 % Expected dividends (1) The expected term assumption for options was determined based on historical data, adjusted for the recent reduction of the contractual life for options from 10 to seven years. (2) The expected volatility was determined using a blend of implied volatility and historical volatility over the expected term, which we consider a better indictor of expected volatility than using only historical volatility. (3) The risk free interest rate is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the Companys awards. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures at a rate of 6.6 percent. FAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially and result in volatility in our stock based compensation expense amounts. Overview of 2006 Financial Results Relative to the year ended December 31, 2005, total revenue for the year increased 23 percent to $263.0 million. The increase was driven by the combined performance of all business units. International product sales represented approximately 20 percent of net product sales for the year. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our net product sales. Total operating expenses were approximately $143.7 million for 2006, compared to $117.1 million in 2005. This $26.6 million increase was driven by a combination of factors: approximately $7.3 million of the increase was due to stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of FAS 123R, $6.7 million represents increased training and promotion costs, $6.6 million in legal, accounting and other outside consulting costs, $4.4 million in additional compensation and commission related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force and $1.6 million associated with employee related costs due to our increased accounting and finance personnel. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance at December 31, 2006 was $30.8 million, an increase of approximately $7.4 million from December 31, 2005.

Product sales for fiscal 2006 were $253.4 million compared to $206.5 million and $147.8 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Product sales by product market for the periods shown were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Sports Medicine $ 166,665 66 % $ 139,868 68 % $ 97,574 66 % ENT 59,886 24 % 43,546 21 % 28,357 19 % ArthroCare Spine 26,635 10 % 23,110 11 % 21,614 15 % Coblation Technology 190 0 % 9 0 % 285 0 % Total Product Sales $ 253,376 100 % $ 206,533 100 % $ 147,830 100 % Product sales by geography for the periods shown were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Americas $ 202,333 80 % $ 164,072 79 % $ 111,791 76 % United Kingdom 12,478 5 % 11,863 6 % 13,718 9 % Germany 11,405 4 % 9,007 4 % 7,398 5 % Rest of World 27,160 11 % 21,591 11 % 14,923 10 % Total product sales $ 253,376 100 % $ 206,533 100 % $ 147,830 100 % 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our sustained increase in direct sales presence has continued to have a positive effect on product sales since inception, as did the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through promotional programs of controller placements, commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy, and the introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform. Additionally, our acquisitions of Atlantech, Parallax, ATI and Opus Medical product lines have continued to have a positive effect on sales growth. We generally sell our disposable devices at or near list price, except for sales to international distributors and marketing partners, which are sold at discounted prices. We anticipate that disposable device sales will remain a key component of our product sales in the near future. Based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year, we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market, while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment. To achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time, we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures, expand physicians education with respect to Coblation technology, and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications. We believe that, in our ten years of product shipments, we have penetrated 30 to 35 percent of the hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the United States. We believe that approximately 45 percent of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures. We expect our sales to continue to be strong in 2007, as we continue to increase our presence in Europe and benefit from the integration of our recent acquisitions. Royalties, fees, and other revenues consist mainly of revenue from the licensing of our products and technology and shipping and handling costs billed to customers. Royalties, fees, and other revenues increased to $9.6 million in 2006 from $7.8 million and $6.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, as a result of increased sales of our products and growth in the markets for which we receive royalties. Cost of Product Sales Cost of product sales consist of manufacturing costs, material costs, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, warranty and other direct product costs. Additionally, cost of product sales includes amortization of controller unit placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of controller units shipped to customers, with the costs being capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the useful life of the controller unit. Amortization of controllers was $6.6 million in 2006, compared to $5.8 million and $6.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Controller amortization represented 2.6 percent of product sales in 2006. This is compared to 2005 and 2004, when controller amortization represented 2.8 percent and 4.3 percent of product sales, respectively. Cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes $0.6 million of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options. The decrease as a percent of cost of sales for 2006 compared to 2005 is driven by the slower growth in controller placements volume in conjunction with increased revenue reported for the period. The decrease as a percent of cost of sales for 2005 compared to 2004 is driven by the leveling of controller placements in conjunction with increased revenue reported for the period. Cost of product sales was $76.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for 2006, compared to $64.2 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, in 2005 and $51.1 million, or 33 percent of total revenues, in 2004. Gross product margin as a percentage of sales increased to 70 percent in 2006 from 69 percent in 2005 and 65 percent in 2004. The increase in gross product margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 is a result of an increase in average selling prices accompanied by a decrease in component costs. The favorable increase in gross product margin percentage in 2005 as compared to 2004 is due to lower manufacturing costs at our Costa Rica manufacturing facility, including the benefit of a full year of Opus production in Costa Rica, as well as improved margins from the MDA acquisition. Controller manufacturing was principally conducted in Costa Rica during 2005, where we benefited from lower labor rates as compared to 2004. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We expect gross margin to continue to increase as we continue to increase our average selling prices and improve operating efficiencies. Operating Expenses Research and development expense increased in 2006 to $23.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, from $21.0 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, in 2005 and $13.3 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, in 2004. The dollar increase in research and development expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to $1.3 million in increased stock compensation expense due to our adoption of FAS 123R, along with a continued investment in our Coblation based products and in the MDA product line, resulting in an increase of $0.4 million in consulting and outside service costs, $0.3 million in additional depreciation expense, and $0.2 million in patent related and product development charges. The increase in research and development costs in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily due to $5.5 million in increased compensation and related expenses due to additional headcount, $0.6 million in prototype development costs, $0.6 million in outside services, and $0.8 million in fixed charges, primarily depreciation and rent. We expect to increase the dollar amount of research and development expenses through continued expenditures on new product development, regulatory affairs, clinical studies and patents. We expect these expenses as a percentage of product sales to remain essentially flat. Sales and marketing expense increased to $91.9 million, or 35 percent of total revenues, in 2006 from $75.3 million, or 35 percent of total revenues, in 2005, and from $58.1 million, or 38 percent of total revenues, in 2004. The increase in absolute dollars for 2006 compared to 2005 related primarily to $6.7 million in training and promotion costs, $4.4 million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force, $2.7 million in stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of FAS 123R, and $2.7 million in settlement fees associated with the Settlement and License Agreement between ArthroCare and MarTec, LLC (formerly Bonutti IP, LLC). Increased expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to $10.3 million in increased sales commissions associated with increased sales volume, $5.6 million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force, and $1.1 million in increased accounts receivable reserves. We anticipate that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the expansion of our distribution capabilities to address the spinal surgery and ear, nose and throat markets, higher dealer commissions from increased sales, the additional cost of penetrating international markets, higher promotional, demonstration and sample expenses, and additional investments in the sales, marketing and support staff necessary to commercialize and market future products. General and administrative expense increased to $21.4 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, in 2006, from $12.2 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, in 2005 and $16.3 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, in 2004. The increase is primarily due to a net increase of $3.5 million in legal, accounting and other outside services costs, which reflects the receipt of settlement payments associated with the Smith & Nephew License and Settlement Agreement, recorded as a reduction in legal fees, $3.3 million of stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of FAS 123R, $1.6 million of additional compensation and related expenses associated with increasing our headcount in our accounting and other administrative functions, and $0.8 million in facilities and insurance charges. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily due to the receipt of litigation settlement payments associated with the Smith & Nephew License and Settlement Agreement, which was recorded as a reduction of legal fees, partially offset by $2.1 million of additional compensation and related expenses associated with increasing our headcount in our accounting and other administrative functions. We expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of total revenues during 2007 due to continued leveraging of our existing infrastructure and operating procedures. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Amortization of intangible assets increased to $7.2 million, or 3 percent of total revenues, in 2006, from $6.2 million, or 3 percent of total revenues, in 2005, and $2.7 million, or 2 percent of total revenues, in 2004. The increase in 2006 from 2005 is primarily due to a full year of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from ATI. The increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the ATI and Opus Medical acquisitions. We expect that amortization of intangible assets will increase in future periods as we acquire additional assets. Acquired in process research and development costs (IPR&D) were not incurred by us during the year ended December 31, 2006. During the third quarter of 2005 we incurred $2.4 million of acquired in process research and development costs in connection with the research and development efforts acquired in our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ATI. Prior to the acquisition, we did not have a comparable product under development. This expense related to the development of technology for arresting bleeding that had not yet reached technological feasibility at ATI and had no alternative future use. At December 31, 2005, the research and development of this technology was completed and the Stammberger Foam product, which utilizes this technology, was commercialized during 2006 for use in ENT procedures. In connection with our acquisition of Opus Medical during the fourth quarter of 2004, we expensed $36.4 million of the purchase price for IPR&D for projects related to automated suturing technology applicable to sports medicine surgical procedures. As of December 31, 2005, we had incurred the remainder of the research costs related to these products, and the products were commercialized during 2006. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net was a net expense of $1.8 million in 2006 compared to a net expense of $2.3 million in 2005 and income of $0.8 million in 2004. The $0.5 million decrease in expense in 2006 is primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains in 2006, whereas in 2005 we had foreign exchange losses. Of the $3.1 million increase in net interest and other expense in 2005 compared to 2004, approximately $0.4 million is associated with interest on debt incurred due to our acquisitions of MDA and Opus Medical. The remaining increase in net expense is primarily attributable to foreign exchange losses incurred in 2005. We do not expect material fluctuations in interest and other income since we plan to fund our business through our operating cash flows in the foreseeable future. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $9.0 million for 2006, compared to $7.2 million for 2005 and $3.3 million for 2004. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 22 percent compared to 23 percent in 2005 and (14) percent in 2004; however, excluding the Opus Medical in process research and development charge in 2004, the effective rate was 24 percent. The improvement in our tax rate each year from 2004 through 2006 is primarily due to continued expansion of business activities in our Costa Rica operations and tax credits for research and development activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2006, we had $113.7 million in working capital, compared to $98.8 million at December 31, 2005. Our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $30.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments at December 31, 2006. Cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less. Our short term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, whereas at December 31, 2005 they consisted primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds. Cash generated by operating activities in 2006 was $43.8 million, as compared to $37.2 million in 2005 and $17.2 million in 2004. The cash generated in 2006 was primarily attributable to $31.7 million of net income and non cash items such as $21.3 million of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of $9.8 million, partially offset by a $13.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales volume. The 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements cash generated in 2005 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories precipitated by our increased sales volume and operating activities. The cash generated in 2004 was primarily attributable to net income, excluding certain charges for non cash items of $55.9 million, partially offset by an increased investment in inventory necessary for our increased sales volume, and an increase in accounts receivable and other assets, also precipitated by our increased sales volume and operating activity. Accounts receivable, net of allowances, increased to $61.9 million at December 31, 2006, from $47.1 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in accounts receivable in 2006 was due to increased sales volume. Accounts receivable, net of allowances, increased to $47.1 million at December 31, 2005, from $34.0 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in accounts receivable in 2005 was due to the significant increase in sales. Inventories increased to $51.5 million at December 31, 2006 from $47.8 million at December 31, 2005 and $40.5 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in inventory was net of a provision for excess and obsolete products of $4.2 million. Over two years, we have increased inventories in order to support anticipated increasing product sales activity. We expect future inventory levels to increase in absolute dollar value in order to support sales volume increases, to provide safety stock and support our expansion into additional markets. Cash used in investing activities was $86.5 million in 2006, as compared to $16.4 million in 2005 and $70.1 million in 2004. Cash used in investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to a $55.2 million payment to former Opus Medical shareholders, $17.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment, and $26.9 million for the purchase of available for sale securities, partially offset by $15.0 million of sales of available for sale securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 was primarily due to the $10.0 million payment made for the purchase of ATIs assets in August 2005, accompanied by $9.6 million associated with the capitalization of controllers and $3.7 million in fixed asset investments, offset by net sales of $7.4 million in available for sale securities. Cash used in investing activities in 2004 was primarily due to the purchases of MDA and Opus Medical for an aggregate of $56.1 million, in addition to $15.0 million in investments in fixed assets, offset by net sales of available for sales securities of $1.0 million. The fair value of our investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2006 was $15.2 million. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds. Cash provided by financing activities was $37.7 million in 2006, as compared to $11.2 million in cash used in financing activities in 2005 and $43.8 million in cash provided by financing activities in 2004. Cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was due primarily to $28.1 million of proceeds from stock option purchases, and a $9.5 million tax benefit related to the stock option expenses. Cash used in financing activities in 2005 was primarily due to $28.9 million of loan repayments, partially offset by $16.5 million of proceeds from stock option exercises. The increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants from 2005 is primarily driven by our higher stock prices in 2006, which led to increased exercises of options and warrants. Cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was primarily due to loans taken out to finance our acquisitions. On January 13, 2006, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks (collectively, the Lenders). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, ArthroCare may borrow up to $100.0 million under a revolving line of credit from the named Lenders at the lead Lenders Prime Rate or the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate, plus a spread. The spread over the Prime Rate or LIBOR Rate is determined by our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. On January 18, 2006, we borrowed $35.0 million. On April 4, 2006, we borrowed an additional $3.5 million, which was subsequently repaid on May 12, 2006. On November 20, 2006 we repaid the balance of the loan. As of December 31, 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Credit Agreement has a five year maturity and includes additional terms under which we may request an increase of up to $75.0 million in commitments from the Lenders, as business needs dictate. The Credit Agreement also contains various covenants that specify minimum or maximum financial ratios. We were in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 2006. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, expensing of stock options, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. The following table aggregates all material contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affect our financial condition and liquidity as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Lessthan 1Year 1 3Years 4 5Years After 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 13,360 $ 2,411 $ 3,580 $ 2,993 $ 4,376 Purchase commitments with suppliers (1) 11,607 5,900 5,707 Total $ 24,967 $ 8,311 $ 9,287 $ 2,993 $ 4,376 (1) Represents agreements to purchase products that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the payments. We believe that cash generated from operations, as well as our existing cash balances and short term investments, will be sufficient to fund our operations through fiscal year 2007 and in the near future. Excluding any acquisition related activities, we plan to fund our future operations through our operating cash flows. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including our success in commercializing our products, development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy, the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices, obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business, the status of regulatory approvals and competition. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48, an interpretation of FAS 109, prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 is effective beginning January 1, 2007. The differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Implementation of FIN 48 requires management to develop judgmental estimates about tax uncertainties. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our operating results and financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting FAS 157 on our operating results and financial position. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. (SAB) 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. In SAB 108, the SEC staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of our financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods. We currently use, and have historically applied, the dual method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact, adversely or otherwise, our results of operations or cash flows for our cash and cash equivalents. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2006 for our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments (in thousands): Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments $ 30,756 Average interest rate 5.0 % Although payments under the operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices, we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with operating leases. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement incur interest based on current market interest rates. To the extent that these rates fluctuate, our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to borrow needed capital at a critical time, could be significantly affected. Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our international sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In 2006, most of these currencies remained stable relative to the U.S. Dollar. To the extent that the exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar, we will experience variations in our results of operations and financial condition. Our cash and cash equivalents in 2006 are denominated primarily in U.S. Dollars; however, we also maintain significant balances in Euros, Swedish Krona and Costa Rican Colones. A 10 percent change in the December 31, 2006 exchange rates for these currencies would have an impact on pre tax income of approximately $0.6 million.
