ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated products that address large and growing markets and are based on proprietary oral drug delivery technologies. We have developed two commercial products. GLUMETZA (metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets) is a once daily treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes that we jointly commercialize in the United States with King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ProQuin XR (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride extended release tablets) is a once daily treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections that Esprit Pharma, Inc. markets in the United States. We have a three pronged approach to product development designed to optimize the use and value of our drug delivery technologies, while managing the costs and risks associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. We develop products for our own account that are designed to compete in large growing markets and that can be highly differentiated from immediate release versions of the compounds upon which they are based. Second, we selectively enter into collaborative partnerships with other companies where the unique capabilities of our technology can provide superior value to a partners compound, resulting in significantly greater value for Depomed than a traditional fee for service arrangement. Third, we enter into arrangements that enable our technology to be applied by other companies to a greater number of compounds than our infrastructure can support, so as to derive additional value from our technology. We plan to commercialize our proprietary products, relying on partners to cover the large primary care audiences, while maintaining co promotion and distribution rights in order to be in a position to create our own sales force when appropriate, thereby increasing the value to us of our products, and our control over them. Our most advanced product candidate is Gabapentin GR, an extended release form of gabapentin we are developing. With respect to Gabapentin GR, we have completed enrollment of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, completed and announced positive results of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and submitted an investigational new drug application for a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes. We have other product candidates in earlier stages of development, including a treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES A detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. 40 Revenue Recognition Revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed, the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable. The GLUMETZA product that we sell to wholesalers and retail pharmacies is subject to rights of return up to twelve months after product expiration. Given the limited sales history of GLUMETZA, we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. Accordingly, we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of GLUMETZA until the right of return no longer exists, which occurs at the earlier of the time GLUMETZA units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return. We estimate patient prescriptions dispensed using an analysis of third party information, including third party market research data, information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and out movement and retail pharmacy re stocking activity. GLUMETZA was launched in September 2006 and accordingly, the Company has not had significant history estimating the number of patient prescriptions dispensed. If we underestimate or overestimate patient prescriptions dispensed for a given period, adjustments to revenue may be necessary in future periods. As a result of this policy, we recognized $526,000 in GLUMETZA product revenue in 2006, which is net of estimated patient support program discounts, wholesaler fees, stocking allowances, prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. We have a deferred revenue balance of $4.8 million at December 31, 2006 for GLUMETZA product shipments, net of estimated patient support program discounts, wholesaler fees, stocking allowances, prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. In addition, the costs of manufacturing GLUMETZA associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs, which are included in inventory, until such time the deferred revenue is recognized. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we commenced a patient support program for GLUMETZA which has two components. Patients who participate in the GLUMETZA loyalty card program receive discounts of up to $20 off their required co pay for a GLUMETZA prescription. In addition to the loyalty card program, a separate voucher program provides patients with a supply of 35 tablets at no cost to the patient when the voucher is redeemed at a pharmacy. Our costs associated with actual patient support program discounts redeemed are recorded as a reduction of revenue and were minimal in 2006. We have made estimates of our costs associated with loyalty cards and vouchers that have been dispensed to patients and yet to be redeemed in 2006, and have included these estimates as a reduction to deferred revenue. Product sales revenue related to our supply agreement with Esprit for ProQuin XR is recognized after the expiration of a 30 day period in which Esprit may reject product that does not meet agreed upon specifications. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with applicable contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize royalties under our agreement with Esprit based on Esprits sales, net of any estimated returns, discounts, rebates and chargebacks. Royalties received under our agreement with Esprit that are greater than the minimum royalty due are recognized based on Esprits sales, net of any estimated returns, discounts, rebates and chargebacks. Total royalty revenue recognized by the Company through December 31, 2006 was equal to Esprits 2006 minimum royalty obligation. Royalties received under our agreement with Biovail related to the marketing of GLUMETZA in Canada are recognized when the royalty payments are received as the amounts are not 41 estimable. Royalty payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as royalty advances until earned. Collaborative revenue recognized relates to services rendered in connection with collaborative arrangements and the achievement of milestones under such arrangements. Revenue related to collaborative agreements with corporate partners is recognized as the expenses are incurred under each contract. We are required to perform services as specified in each respective agreement on a best or commercially reasonable efforts basis, and we are reimbursed based on the costs incurred on each specific contract. Nonrefundable substantive milestone payments are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that milestone provision of the arrangement and when collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from license arrangements, including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations (if any), of the licensee, is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory. If we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement, license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period. License fee payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned. Research and Development Expense and Accruals Research and development expenses include related salaries, contractor fees, clinical trial costs, facilities costs, administrative expenses and allocations of corporate costs. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred. These expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations. Our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations. If possible, we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers. However, we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff. If we underestimate or overstimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time, adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods. Historically, our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2006, we began accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS123(R)), using the modified prospective transition method. We use the Black Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares. The Black Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. The most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award. For our volatility assumption, we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options. We have concluded that our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and therefore, as of January 1, 2006, we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option, as illustrated in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107). As required, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods. FAS 123(R) requires that employee and director stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method. Stock based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123(R) in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to stock options and the ESPP was $2,572,000, which consisted of $976,000 in research and development 42 expense, $1,584,000 in selling, general and administrative expense and $12,000 in cost of sales. As a result of adopting FAS 123(R), our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2,342,000 higher than if we continued to account for stock based compensation under APB 25 as we did in comparable prior year periods. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss applicable to common stock shareholders per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.06 higher than if we continued to account for stock based compensation under APB 25. The implementation of FAS 123(R) did not have an impact on our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, no stock based compensation was recognized for the ESPP or for option grants when the exercise price of the options granted was equal to or greater than the fair value market price of the stock on the grant date. In accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R), we eliminated the balance of the deferred compensation calculated under APB No. 25 to the common stock account on January 1, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 we recognized approximately $386,000 and $258,000, respectively, of stock based compensation expense for employees under APB No. 25. FAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on historical experience. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), pro forma information required under FAS 123 included forfeitures as they occurred. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Total revenues are summarized in the following table: 2006 2005 2004 Product sales: ProQuin XR $ 1,265,000 $ 930,000 $ GLUMETZA 526,000 Total product sales 1,791,000 930,000 Royalties: ProQuin XR 3,931,000 669,000 GLUMETZA 109,000 Total royalties 4,040,000 669,000 License revenue: ProQuin XR 2,068,000 424,000 GLUMETZA 1,542,000 151,000 31,000 Total license revenue 3,610,000 575,000 31,000 Collaborative revenue 110,000 2,231,000 172,000 Total revenues $ 9,551,000 $ 4,405,000 $ 203,000 Product sales We began selling GLUMETZA in September 2006 to wholesalers and retail pharmacies that is subject to rights of return up to twelve months after product expiration. Given the limited sales history of GLUMETZA and return privileges, the Company currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment. We defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of GLUMETZA to our customers until such time GLUMETZA units are dispensed through patient 43 prescriptions. We estimate the volume of prescription units dispensed by pharmacies based on data provided by external, independent sources. In 2006, we recognized $526,000 of product sales of GLUMETZA, which is net of estimated patient support program discounts, wholesaler fees, stocking allowances, prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. We have deferred recognition of revenue on GLUMETZA product shipments to customers in which we estimate have not been dispensed through patient prescriptions. At December 31, 2006, we have a deferred revenue balance, which is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, of $4.8 million associated with the deferral of revenue on GLUMETZA product shipments, which is net of estimated patient support program discounts, wholesaler fees, stocking allowances, prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. ProQuin XR product sales relate to our supply agreement with Esprit. We began supplying Esprit with commercial quantities of ProQuin XR in the fourth quarter of 2005. All revenue recognized related to ProQuin XR product sales in 2006 was recorded in the first half of the year. As a result of their existing inventory levels and demand forecast for ProQuin XR product, Esprit did not make any purchases from us in the second half of 2006. Royalties Our agreement with Esprit provides for royalty payments by Esprit to us of 15 percent to 25 percent of ProQuin XR net sales in the United States, based on escalating net sales and subject to certain minimum royalty amounts. Esprits minimum royalty amount for 2006 was $4.6 million and under our amended license agreement entered into in July 2006, amounts paid by Esprit for 2005 royalties were creditable against the 2006 minimum royalty obligation. Net sales of ProQuin XR by Esprit for 2005 and 2006 did not reach levels that would obligate Esprit to pay an amount greater than the minimum royalty obligation, and accordingly, through January 2007, Esprit has paid us $4.6 million in total royalties for 2005 and 2006. We recognized $3.9 million in royalty revenue under this agreement in 2006, which represents the $4.6 million minimum royalty obligation less $0.7 million of royalty revenue recognized in 2005. Esprits minimum royalty obligation for 2007 is $5.0 million, and in subsequent years is $5.0 million per year, subject to annual increases in the consumer price index beginning in 2008. Should Esprit not pay us the minimum royalty due under the agreement in future years, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In 2006, we received royalties of $109,000 from Biovail based on net sales of the 500mg GLUMETZA in Canada. License revenue As of December 31, 2006, we have received $40.0 million in license fees under our license agreement with Esprit for ProQuin XR. We received $30.0 million in license fees in July 2005 and an additional $10.0 million in December 2006. The license fees received are being recognized as revenue ratably commencing on our receipt of the fees through June 2020, which represents the length of time we are obligated to manufacture ProQuin XR under our ProQuin XR supply agreement with Esprit. Accordingly, license revenue increased in 2006 over 2005 as a result of a full year of amortization rather than a partial year of amortization in 2005. Esprit is obligated to pay us an additional $10.0 million in July 2007. Should Esprit not pay us the final $10.0 million license fee installment, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We also received $25.0 million in license fees from Biovail in July 2005. We are recognizing the $25.0 million license fee payment as revenue ratably until February 2023, which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay Biovail on net sales of GLUMETZA in the United States and for our obligation to use Biovail as our sole supplier of the 1000mg GLUMETZA, should the 1000mg GLUMETZA obtain approval in the United States. 44 Collaborative revenue Collaborative revenue decreased in 2006 from 2005 and increased in 2005 from 2004 as a result of services performed in 2005 under our agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, which were completed in December 2005. We are not aware of any additional work that we will be requested to perform on this pharmaceutical compound. Cost of Sales 2006 2005 2004 Cost of sales $ 1,601,000 $ 909,000 $ Cost of sales consists of costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, contract manufacturing and packaging costs, product quality testing, internal employee costs related to the manufacturing process, distribution costs and shipping costs related to ProQuin XR and GLUMETZA product sales. Cost of sales increased in 2006 as a result of the GLUMETZA launch in September 2006. The costs of manufacturing associated with deferred revenue on GLUMETZA product shipments are recorded as deferred costs, which are included in inventory, until such time the deferred revenue is recognized. We expect cost of sales to continue to increase in 2007, as we expect product sales of GLUMETZA to increase over 2006 levels. Research and Development Expense Our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, outsourced clinical and other research activities, consultants, depreciation, facilities and utilities. The scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development, as it is not possible to determine the nature, timing and extent of clinical trials and studies, the FDAs requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation, if any, by potential partners. As potential products proceed through the development process, each step is typically more extensive, and therefore more expensive, than the previous step. Success in development therefore, generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product launch. Furthermore, our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners. Depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed, the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted. Total research and development expense, as compared to the prior year, was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Research and development expense $ 26,891,000 $ 18,369,000 $ 21,359,000 Dollar change from prior year 8,522,000 (2,990,000 ) Percentage change from prior year 46 % (14 %) In 2006, the majority of our research and development expense was related to Gabapentin GR. The increase in research and development expense in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to completion of our Phase 2 and commencement of our Phase 3 clinical trials for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We expect to complete our Phase 3 clinical trial for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in 2007. We also incurred an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.0 million in research and development expense as a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The decrease in research and development expense in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to reductions in research and development expense for ProQuin XR, which received FDA approval in the second quarter of 2005. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in research and development expense for 45 Gabapentin GR, which began Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in January 2005. We categorize our research and development expense by project. The table below shows research and development costs for our major clinical development programs, as well as other expenses associated with all other projects in our product pipeline. 2006 2005 2004 Gabapentin GR $ 23,995,000 $ 12,336,000 $ 4,982,000 ProQuin XR 2,250,000 11,171,000 Other projects 2,896,000 3,783,000 5,206,000 Total research and development expenses $ 26,891,000 $ 18,369,000 $ 21,359,000 The following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives as of March 2007. In addition to the products listed in the table below, from time to time we may enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that, if successful, may be followed by definitive agreements to advance development of the product candidate. Program Potential Indications Development Status Gabapentin GR Postherpetic neuralgia Phase 3 enrollment complete. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy Phase 2 trial complete. Menopausal hot flashes IND for Phase 2 trial submitted to FDA. Undisclosed compound Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Phase 2a proof of concept studies underway. Undisclosed compound Confidential(1) Preclinical studies. Partnered with Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Undisclosed compound Confidential(1) Partnered with New River Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1) The compound and indication may not be disclosed pursuant to the terms of the applicable collaboration agreement. We expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take, on average, from four to eight years to research, develop and obtain FDA approval in the United States, assuming that we are successful. We generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings. These studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product. We then submit the results of these studies to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which, if successful, allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process: In Phase 1, we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drugs early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time. A Phase 1 trial for our average potential product may take 6 to 12 months to plan and complete. In Phase 2, we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and further evidence of safety. A Phase 2 trial for our average potential product may take 9 to 18 months to plan and complete. 46 In Phase 3, we conduct large scale, multi center, comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA prior to commercialization of the product. A Phase 3 trial for our average potential product may take 1 to 3 years to plan and complete. The most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from the Phase 3 trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process. We began a Phase 3 trial for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in May 2006 and we expect to report the results of the study mid 2007. If the results of the study are positive, we expect to file an NDA for Gabapentin GR for postherpetic neuralgia in the fourth quarter of 2007. We anticipate our research and development expense to increase slightly in 2007 as we expect to complete our Phase 3 trial for Gabapentin GR for postherpetic neuralgia, commence a Phase 2 trial for Gabapentin GR for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes, and conduct a Phase 2a proof of concept study for an undisclosed compound for the treatment of GERD. The successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing. The FDA may, at its discretion, re evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials after approval, which are known as Phase 4 trials. Various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record keeping for each product. The lengthy process of seeking FDA approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel expenses to support our operating activities, marketing and promotion expenses associated with GLUMETZA, facility costs and professional expenses, such as legal and accounting fees. Total selling, general and administrative expenses, as compared to the prior year, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 22,667,000 $ 11,639,000 $ 5,179,000 Dollar change from prior year 11,028,000 6,460,000 Percentage change from prior year 95 % 125 % In 2004, we announced our determination to evolve from a solely product development focused company to an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company with sales and marketing of our own products. Preliminary staffing for these activities began in 2005. In 2006, we enhanced our internal sales and marketing capabilities through the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees and the engagement of consultants. We anticipate the build up of our commercial infrastructure will continue over the next several years. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to approximately $3.0 million in expense related to marketing costs associated with GLUMETZA, which was launched in September 2006, $2.4 million in related promotion fees due to King under the promotion agreement related to GLUMETZA, an increase of $1.7 million in legal fees due to our patent infringement case against IVAX, and an increase in stock compensation expense of $1.2 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 2005 from 2004 was primarily due to approximately $3.5 million in expense related to the planning and organization of commercial manufacturing activities at our contract manufacturer for ProQuin XR, increased salary expense of 47 $1.3 million related to bonuses accrued under the bonus plan approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in July 2005 and marketing expense of $0.8 million primarily related to ProQuin XR marketing incurred prior to the licensing of ProQuin XR and during the transition of marketing activities to Esprit. We expect that selling, general and administrative expense will continue to increase as we build a sales force and incur increased expenses associated with the promotion and marketing of GLUMETZA. Interest Income and Expense 2006 2005 2004 Interest income $ 2,031,000 $ 1,445,000 $ 489,000 Interest expense (460,000 ) (929,000 ) Net interest income (expense) $ 2,031,000 $ 985,000 $ (440,000 ) Interest income increased in 2006 over 2005 due to higher investment balances in 2006 resulting from of our receipt of license fees from Esprit and Biovail in 2005 and also due to higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio. Interest expense in 2005 and 2004 was mainly due to interest on a promissory note, issued to Elan Corporation plc, or Elan. The note was fully repaid in June 2005. Gain from Extinguishment of Debt In connection with the formation of DDL, an Elan joint venture, Elan made a loan facility available to us for up to $8,010,000 in principal to support our 80.1% share of the joint ventures research and development costs pursuant to a convertible promissory note issued by us to Elan. The funding term of the loan expired in November 2002. The note had a six year term, was due in January 2006, and bore interest at 9% per annum, compounded semi annually, on any amounts borrowed under the facility. However, in June 2005, we repurchased the promissory note with an outstanding balance of $10,724,000, including $2,927,000 of accrued interest, for $9,665,000 including commissions paid to a financial consultant and legal fees. A gain on the extinguishment of the debt of $1,059,000 was recorded in other income in 2005. Series A Preferred Stock and Deemed Dividends In January 2000, we issued 12,015 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock accrued a dividend of 7% per annum, compounded semi annually and payable in shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock was convertible at anytime between January 2002 and January 2006 into our common stock. The original conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock was $12.00. However, as a result of our March 2002 and October 2003 financings, the conversion price was adjusted to $9.51 per share. In December 2004, we entered into an agreement with the Series A Preferred shareholder to resolve a misunderstanding between us and the shareholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock (the December 2004 Agreement). Pursuant to the December 2004 Agreement, among other matters, we agreed to adjust the conversion price to $7.50 per share. We and the shareholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the Series A conversion price. Prior to December 2004, the amounts calculated as Series A Preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following EITF Issue No. 98 5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios (Issue No. 98 5). As a result of the December 2004 Agreement, we determined that a significant modification of the preferred stock agreement had occurred, and, therefore, a new commitment date was established for the Series A Preferred Stock. Further, we determined that the fair value of the modified preferred stock 48 was below the carrying value of such securities as of the date of the modification, therefore, no deemed dividend resulted from this modification. Also, we determined that although a new commitment date had been established, this change did not result in a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 27, Application of Issue No. 98 5 to Certain Convertible Instruments. However, an anti dilution provision of the Series A Preferred Stock was triggered by our January 2005 financing, which adjusted the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock to $7.12. As a result of the adjusted conversion price and an increase in the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock due to additional accumulated dividends, the Series A Preferred Stock now contains a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to Issue No. 98 5. In conjunction with the modification of the agreement, we issued a warrant to the Series A Preferred shareholder. The value of the warrant was considered in determining the value of the modified security. The warrant is convertible into shares of our common stock during the period between January 2006 and January 2009. The conversion price of the warrant initially was $7.12, which was equal to the Series A Preferred Stock conversion price in effect as of January 20, 2006. The conversion price of the warrant decreases by approximately 4.8% per year during the conversion period, such that the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the warrant will increase by approximately 5.1% per year. The conversion of the warrant may be satisfied only by surrender of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock accrued dividends through January 20, 2006, the date the warrant initially became exercisable. As a result of the issuance of the warrant, the preferred stock may be surrendered in exchange for common stock for an additional three years through January 20, 2009. As long as the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the number of shares into which the warrant can be converted increases as the conversion price of the warrant decreases resulting in additional deemed dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 we recognized Series A Preferred Stock deemed dividends of approximately $665,000, $842,000 and zero, respectively, attributable to the beneficial conversion feature from the accrued dividends and decreasing warrant price. We will continue to recognize Series A Preferred Stock deemed dividends until the earlier of the time the Series A Preferred Stock is surrendered or January 2009. As of December 31, 2006, there were 18,158 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $18,159,000. The warrant was convertible into 2,672,423 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $6.79 as of December 31, 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of December 31, 2006 2005 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 33,557,000 $ 59,073,000 Since inception through December 31, 2006, we have financed our product development and operations primarily from private and public sales of equity securities and receipts of upfront license fees from collaborative and license partners. In January 2005, we completed a registered direct public offering of 5,036,000 shares of our common stock at $4.50 per share with net proceeds of $21,019,000. In July 2005, we received $25.0 million under our license agreement with Biovail and $30.0 million under our license agreement with Esprit. In December 2006, we received an additional $10.0 million from Esprit. Esprit is obligated to pay us an additional $10.0 million in July 2007. 49 In December 2006, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Azimuth Opportunity, Ltd., pursuant to which Azimuth is committed to purchase, from time to time and at our sole discretion, up to the lesser of (a) $30,000,000 of our common stock, or (b) 8,399,654 shares of common stock. Sales to Azimuth under the agreement, if any, will occur over a 24 month term and will be made at a price equal to the average closing price of our common stock over a given pricing period, minus a discount ranging from 3.775% to 6.375%, which varies based on a threshold price set by us. Upon each sale of the our common stock to Azimuth under the agreement, we have also agreed to pay Reedland Capital Partners a placement fee equal to 1.125% of the aggregate dollar amount of common stock purchased by Azimuth. Azimuth is not required to purchase our common stock when the price of our common stock is below $2 per share. As of December 31, 2006, we have not sold any common stock to Azimuth under this common stock purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we have accumulated net losses of $184.1 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next year. We anticipate that our existing capital resources and contractual amounts due to us will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least the end of 2007. We base this expectation on our current operating plan, which may change as a result of many factors. Our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors, including: expenditures related to our commercialization efforts; results of research and development efforts; financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into, if any; receipt of payments due to us under our contracts with collaborative partners; results of our litigation against IVAX Corporation; changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs; technological advances; results of clinical testing, requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies; and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses, products or technologies. We will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to: conduct research and development programs; conduct preclinical and clinical testing; and manufacture (or have manufactured) and market (or have marketed) potential products using the AcuForm technology. Our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. We have limited credit facilities and except for the common stock purchase agreement with Azimuth, we have no other committed sources of capital. To the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs. We may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions. If adequate funds are not available we may have to: delay, postpone or terminate clinical trials; curtail other operations significantly; and or 50 obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. The inability to raise additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our company. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities: 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (27,700,000 ) $ 28,817,000 $ (23,268,000 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 31,764,000 (34,822,000 ) 4,086,000 Cash provided by financing activities 2,945,000 12,618,000 91,000 In 2006, cash used in operating activities was primarily our net loss for the year adjusted for stock based compensation, depreciation expense and movements in working capital. In 2005, cash provided from operations was due primarily to increases in deferred revenue related to license payments received under our agreements with Esprit and Biovail, partially offset by our net loss for the year. In 2004, cash used in operations was primarily our net loss for the year adjusted for depreciation and movements in working capital. Cash provided by investing activities in 2006 was due to a $32,539,000 net decrease in marketable securities partially offset by $774,000 in purchases of laboratory and office equipment. Cash used in investing activities in 2005 consisted of a net increase in marketable securities of $34,031,000 resulting from investment of license fees received under our agreements with Esprit and Biovail and $791,000 in purchases of lab and office equipment. Cash provided by investing activities in 2004 consisted primarily of a net decrease in marketable securities of $6,758,000 partially offset by $2,673,000 in purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements, including approximately $1,936,000 of improvements related to additional space we leased. Cash provided from financing activities in 2006 consisted of $2,945,000 of proceeds from exercises of stock options, warrants and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash provided from financing activities in 2005 consisted primarily of net proceeds of $21,019,000 from our registered direct public offering of 5,036,000 shares of common stock for $4.50 per share in January 2005 and $1,370,000 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, warrants and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, which were partially offset by the repayment of the Elan promissory note of $9,665,000 and $106,000 in payments on equipment loans and capital lease obligations. Cash provided from financing activities in 2004 was $91,000 and consisted primarily of $419,000 of proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants partially offset by $328,000 in payments on equipment loans and capital leases. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations are shown in the following table: Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years Total Operating leases $ 1,230,000 $ 2,191,000 $ 19,000 $ 3,440,000 Purchase commitments 2,752,000 2,752,000 $ 3,982,000 $ 2,191,000 $ 19,000 $ 6,192,000 At December 31, 2006, we had non cancelable purchase orders and minimum purchase obligations for 2007 of $2,542,000 under our manufacturing agreement with MOVA Pharmaceuticals for the manufacture of GLUMETZA. The amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual purchases are expected to exceed these amounts. We are also contractually obligated to pay PharmaNova consultancy fees of $210,000 in 2007 under a consulting agreement related to our Gabapentin GR product candidate for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes. The contractual obligations reflected in this table exclude $3.5 million of contingent milestone payments we may be obligated to pay in the future under our sublicense agreement with PharmaNova. 51 These payments relate to various milestones for the product candidate under the sublicense agreement, including dosing of the first patient in any Phase 3 trial, submission to the FDA of an NDA, and FDA approval of an NDA. The above table also excludes any future royalty payments we may be required to pay on products we have licensed or any promotion fees associated with our promotion agreement with King. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by us on January 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity (at date of purchase) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2006, our marketable securities available for sale consisted of U.S. corporate debt and U.S. mortgage backed debt securities with maturity dates of less than two years. Our investments in U.S. corporate debt securities consist primarily of investments in investment grade corporate bonds and notes. Our investments in U.S. government debt securities consist of low risk government agency bonds typically with a rating of A or higher. Our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the United States, particularly because most of our marketable securities are invested in short term debt instruments. As of December 31, 2006, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows: Duration Less than 1 year 1 to 2 years Total Principal amount $ 16,006,000 $ 3,000,000 $ 19,006,000 Fair value $ 15,989,000 $ 2,994,000 $ 18,983,000 Average interest rate 5.24 % 5.03 % 5.21 % Foreign Currency Risk We have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies, nor did we have any significant balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at December 31, 2006. Accordingly, significant changes in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 52
