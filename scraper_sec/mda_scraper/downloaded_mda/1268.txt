ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The Company incurred a net income to holders of common stock of $2,141,364 or $0.04 per share in 2006 compared to a net income of $1,088,028 or $0.02 per share in 2005 and compared to a net loss of $(1,994,025) or ($0.05 per share) in 2004. The Company realized revenues of $9,001,681 in 2006 compared to $7,172,876 in 2005 and compared to $6,109,474 in 2004. Revenues increased $1,828,805 from 2005 due primarily to an increase in oil production in Kansas of approximately 28,871 net barrels of oil (bbls) over 2005 levels. An increase in oil prices accounted for 36% of the increased revenues in 2006 and the increase in produced volumes accounted for 64% of the increased revenues. The Company has offset the normal decline curve in its Kansas properties with additional drilling and well work overs. The gross volumes of oil of 183,013 bbls would have been approximately 147,000 bbls without additional drilling and well work overs. The Company sold 134,164 bbls of oil in 2005 and 118,088 in 2004. The volume of gas sold from the Swan Creek Field decreased to 138,078 Mcf in 2006 from 183,399 Mcf in 2005 and the volume of oil sold from Swan Creek Field decreased to 8,493 barrels in 2006 from 10,388 barrels in 2005. The decline in volumes of oil and gas produced in the Swan Creek Field from existing wells is normal for producing wells and the declines as experienced were not unexpected. The Companys gas production in Kansas in 2005 was only for the month of January 2005 (20,729 Mcf) as the Companys Kansas gas field was sold on March 4, 2005 with the buyers production being retroactive to February 1, 2005. The Kansas gas field had produced 261,446 Mcf of gas in 2004. Gas prices received for sales of gas from the Swan Creek Field averaged $7.27 per Mcf in 2006, $8.74 per Mcf in 2005, and $6.13 in 2004. Oil prices received for sales of oil from the Swan Creek field averaged $60.39 per barrel in 2006, $53.90 per barrel in 2005, and $36.57 in 2004. Oil prices received for sales of oil in Kansas averaged $60.84 per barrel in 2006, $53.48 per barrel in 2005, and $39.41 in 2004. The Companys subsidiary, TPC, had pipeline transportation revenues of $87,822 in 2006, $94,911 in 2005, and $92,599 in 2004. The decreases in revenues in 2006 and 2005 from 2004 resulted from the decrease in volumes of gas produced from the Swan Creek Field. Production costs and taxes in 2006 of $3,287,233 remained consistent with levels in 2005 of $3,046,460 and in 2004 of $3,364,429. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased to $1,911,416 in 2006 from $1,605,043 in 2005 which was a decrease from $2,067,566 in 2004. The increase in 2006 is due to a change in focus by the Company toward drilling in Kansas rather than in Tennessee, therefore removing drilling and development locations in Tennessee. The decrease in 2005 from 2004 levels was due mainly to depletion levels on the Kansas properties in 2004 decreasing in 2005 due to the sale of the Kansas gas field effective February 1, 2005. 33 The Companys general and administrative costs of $1,293,109 in 2006 remained generally consistent with 2005 levels of $1,322,616 and 2004 levels of $1,177,183. The 2006 and 2005 costs included non cash charges related to stock options of $159,160 and $103,400 respectively. Interest expense for 2006 decreased significantly over 2005 and 2004 levels. The substantial decrease is the result of the payoff in 2004 of the Companys loans from Bank One, N.A. and Dolphin Offshore Partners, L.P. and the conversion in 2004 and 2005 of all the Companys preferred stock, which was subject to mandatory redemption, into either interests in a drilling program, common stock or cash payoffs. As of December 31, 2006 the Companys only debt financing are vehicle loans totaling $195,801 and the CitiBank loan of $2,600,000. The Companys public relations costs remained stable at $26,037 for 2006, compared to $30,020 for 2005 and $35,347 for 2004 as the Company continued to apply cost saving methods in the preparation of its annual report and in publishing of press releases. Professional fees in 2006 were $173,932 compared to $263,800 in 2005 and $779,180 in 2004. These fees were greatly reduced in 2005 due to the elimination of outside counsels legal fees following a settlement of Company litigation in 2004. The remaining professional fees in 2006 relate primarily to audit and engineering services. During 2004, the Company recorded a gain from extinguishment of debt in the amount of $336,820 from the Bank One litigation settlement and a gain on disposal of preferred stock of $458,310. The Company also recorded a loss on sale of a drilling rig during 2004 of $107,744. The Company recorded a gain on disposal of Preferred Stock of $655,746 in 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management believes that the Companys foundation for future growth began to solidify in 2004. In 2004, all material litigation involving the Company was resolved, eliminating the substantial ongoing costs and expenses of such litigation. Capital restructuring began in February 2004, when the Companys rights offering to its then shareholders successfully raised sufficient capital to pay in full all pre existing secured debt in the amount of $3.8 million, most of which had been obtained at relatively high interest rates. Also in early 2004 certain unsecured convertible notes entered into in 1998 in the principal amount of $1.5 million were fully paid, and still other convertible notes entered into in 2002 in the original principal amount of $650,000 were paid in full in March 2004. In December, 2004 the Company completed an exchange offer to the thirteen holders of all of the Companys Series A 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Shares) in the face value of $2,867,900. Seven of the thirteen holders elected the cash exchange option, and the face value of $1,085,000 of Series A Shares was exchanged for a cash payment of $723,369. 34 The Company obtained funds for the exchange from cash on hand and the proceeds of a loan from Dolphin Offshore Partners, L.P. (Dolphin) the Companys largest shareholder. Peter E. Salas, the Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors is the sole shareholder and controlling person of Dolphin Management, Inc., the general partner of Dolphin. The loan from Dolphin was in the form of a secured note in principal amount of $550,000 bearing 12% interest per annum. Five of the thirteen Series A shareholders selected a drilling program exchange option and on December 31, 2004 the face value of $1,582,900 of Series A Shares plus dividend value of $31,658 was exchanged for 6.5 of the eight units in an eight well drilling program on the Companys Kansas Properties (the Eight Well Program). In December 2005 the last remaining Series A preferred shareholder exchanged his preferred stock for cash on essentially identical terms as received by the other Series A owners who had exchanged their shares for cash. In early 2005, the Company elected to sell its gas producing properties in Rush County, Kansas for $2.4 million and to utilize all the net proceeds of the sale to pay down the $2.5 million debt to Dolphin incurred by the Company to fund the settlement of the litigation with the Companys former primary lender, Bank One N.A., in May, 2004. This had the effect of reducing the principal balance of the note evidencing that loan from $2.5 million to $150,000, correspondingly reducing the high interest payments on that note and reducing the total secured debt owed by the Company to Dolphin to approximately $700,000 represented by a promissory note dated May 19, 2005, in the principal amount of $700,000 to Dolphin (the $700,000 Note). In August 2005, all of the holders of the Companys Series B 8% and C 6% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B and Series C Shares) in the total aggregate value of $5,113,045.39 consisting of face value, dividends, and interest exchanged their Series B and C shares for cash or for the Companys common stock. The cash option exchange provided for a cash payment equal to 66.67% of the face value together with any unpaid accrued dividends. Holders of approximately 53.2% of the face value of outstanding Series B and C Shares selected this option, exchanging preferred shares having an aggregate value of $2,721,140.39 for cash payments totaling $1,814,184.30. The Company obtained the funds for this exchange primarily from proceeds of a loan of $1,814,000 from Dolphin evidenced by a secured promissory note bearing 12% interest (the $1,814,000 Note). The second option offered to the holders of the Series B and C Shares was to exchange their Series B and C Shares for four shares of the Companys common stock for each dollar of the face value and unpaid accrued dividends and interest on their Series B and C Shares. The holders of the remaining aggregate value of $2,391,905 or 46.8% of the Series B and C shares including Dolphin selected this option. As a result, a total of 9,567,620 shares of the Companys common stock were issued to holders of Series B and C Shares. Of this total number, 4,595,040 shares of unregistered common stock were issued to Dolphin in exchange for the $1,148,760 in aggregate value of the Series B shares held by Dolphin. As a result of this exchange, as of August 22, 2005 the Company no longer had any preferred stockholders and no further obligations under the Series B and C shares. 35 On October 5, 2005 the Company and Hoactzin Partners, L.P. (Hoactzin) signed an agreement whereby Hoactzin surrendered the $700,000 and $1,814,000 Notes and exchanged the Companys obligation to repay this principal amount of $2.514 million for a 94.275% working interest in a new twelve well drilling program (the Twelve Well Program) on the Companys properties in Kansas. The Company retained the 5.725% working interest in the Twelve Well Program not owned by Hoactzin. The principal of the Notes exchanged by Hoactzin represented the funds paid by the Company for the previous exchanges for cash of the Companys Series A, B, and C preferred stock. The controlling person of Hoactzin is Peter E. Salas, the Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors and the controlling person of Dolphin. Under the terms of the Twelve Well Program, the Company retained an option expiring March 31, 2006 to repurchase from Hoactzin the obligations to drill the final six wells of the Twelve Well Program for one half of the principal of notes exchanged by Hoactzin, plus interest on that amount at 6% per annum until the date of any repurchase, plus a 1/16 overriding royalty to Hoactzin on all wells drilled in the Twelve Well Program. Payout and management fee calculations would also be adjusted to reflect any reduction to a six well program. On June 29, 2006 the Company closed a $50,000,000 revolving senior credit facility between the Company and Citibank Texas, N.A. in its own capacity and also as agent for other banks. Under the facility, loans and letters of credit will be available to the Company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of $50,000,000 or the borrowing base in effect from time to time. The Companys initial borrowing base was set at $2,600,000. The initial loan under the facility with Citibank closed on June 29, 2006 in the principal amount of $2.6 million, bearing interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.5%, resulting in a current rate of interest of approximately 8.2%. Interest only is payable during the term of the loan and the principal balance of the loan is due thirty six months from closing. The facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the Companys producing and non producing oil and gas properties and pipeline assets. On June 29, 2006 the Company used $1.393 million of the proceeds of the $2.6 million loan to exercise the Companys option to repurchase from Hoactzin Partners, L.P., the Companys obligation to drill for Hoactzin the final six wells of the Companys Twelve Well Program. If the Company had not exercised its repurchase option, Hoactzin would have received a 94% working interest in the final six wells of the Twelve Well Program until payout as established under the terms of the Twelve Well Program program. However, as a result of the terms of the repurchase option, Hoactzin will receive only a 6.25% overriding royalty in the next six Company wells to be drilled, plus an additional 6.25% overriding royalty in the six Program Wells that have previously been drilled. As a further result of the repurchase, the Twelve Well Program was converted into a six well program, and because six wells had been drilled by the Company as of June 30, 2006 the drilling obligation in this program were satisfied upon exercise of the repurchase option. Consequently, as of June 30, 2006, all well drilling obligations of the Company owed to participants have been satisfied as to both the Eight Well Program (offered to the former Series A preferred stockholders) and the Twelve Well Program (offered to Hoactzin and converted to a 6 well program upon the Companys repurchase of the obligation to drill the last six wells as described above). 36 As of December 31, 2006 all of the obligations of the Company to drill wells under the Eight Well Program and Twelve (now Six) Well program have been satisfied. Under the terms of those programs, upon payment to the participants of 80% of the value invested in the program from proceeds from production, the participants will pay the Company a management fee of 85% of their proceeds. As to the Eight Well Program, that point is expected to be reached in early 2007 resulting in an increase in revenues from these wells to the Company of approximately $50,000 per month at current volumes and prices. As to the Twelve (now 6) Well Program, that point is expected to be reached some time in 2008 or 2009 depending upon prices and production levels experienced from the wells in that Program. As of June 30, 2006 the Company had completed a total reworking of its balance sheets that has been occurring since February 2004. The Company has resolved all major litigation and eliminated the accompanying legal fees. The Companys successful rights offering in February 2004 raised capital to pay off substantial debt. The Company also sold its small block of gas properties in Kansas obtaining a dollar benefit of high gas prices reflected in the $2.4 million sales price while simultaneously eliminating the high operating expenses of those properties. The Company used proceeds of the gas property sale to further pay down debt. The Company has also met its obligations to all of its preferred stockholders by exchanging their preferred stock either for cash, stock, or drilling program interests, and has accordingly cancelled all of the Series A, B, and C preferred stock. The Company has completed all of its well drilling obligations to the drilling program participants out of its own cash flow from operations and without additional borrowing for drilling. The Company continues to successfully rework existing wells, to drill new oil wells in Kansas and is acquiring additional lease acreage to increase production and to grow its reserves through the drill bit. All the while the Company has benefited from the currently high commodity prices for oil and gas and has used higher prices and increasing production volumes to conservatively fuel the reworking of the balance sheets and to prepare the Company for those times in the future when commodity prices may not be as favorable which is a part of the business cycle that is well known and almost universally expected to some degree as an element of the oil and gas industry. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 was $4,353,966 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2,113,763 in 2005. The Companys net income in 2006 increased to $2,141,364 from $1,088,028 in 2005. The impact on cash provided by operating activities was due to the net income for 2006 and was increased by non cash depletion, depreciation, and amortization of $1,863,930 and by non cash compensation and services paid by insurance of equity instruments of $159,160. Cash flow provided in working capital items in 2006 was $122,152 compared to cash used in working capital items of $209,601 in 2005. This resulted in 2006 from decreases from 2005 in accounts receivable of $434,565 offset by a decrease in other accrued liabilities of $251,327. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 was $2,113,763 compared to net cash used in operating activities of ($370,137) in 2004. The Company recorded net income in 2005 of $1,088,028 from a net loss of ($1,994,025) in 2004. The increase in the amount of cash provided in operating activities in 2005 was due to the Companys net income for 2005 and was increased by non cash depletion, depreciation, and amortization of $1,605,043, non cash 37 compensation and services paid by insurance of equity instruments of $103,400 and accretion of liabilities of $242,008. Cash flow used in working capital items in 2005 was $209,601 compared to cash used in working capital items of $913,831 in 2004. This resulted in 2005 from an increase in accounts receivable of $447,653, and an increase in inventory of $154,586 offset by an increase in accounts payable of $277,458. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $4,413,185 for 2006 compared to net cash provided by investment activities in the amount of $2,166,854 for 2005. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2006 was primarily attributable to an increase in oil and gas properties of $5,239,862 offset by a decreased drilling program portion of additional drilling costs of $1,067,400. Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $2,166,854 for 2005 compared to net cash used in the amount of $876,854 for 2004. The net cash provided by investing activities during 2005 was primarily attributable to the sale of the Kansas properties of $2,651,770 offset by increase in Kansas oil and gas properties net of the Kansas drilling programs portion of $402,876. Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $167,915 in 2006 from cash used in financing activities of $4,287,383 in 2005. In 2006 the primary sources of financing included proceeds from borrowings of $2,732,145 compared to $155,075 in 2005. The primary use of cash in financing activities in 2006 was to repay the drilling program liability of $2,324,400. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to $4,287,383 in 2005 from net cash provided by financing activities of $1,202,060 in 2004. In 2005 the primary use of funds was repayment of borrowers of $3,182,636, repayment of redeemable liabilities of $4,241,874, repayment of drilling programs of $1,945,203 offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of $2,391,905 and a new drilling program of $2,514,000 and proceeds from borrowing of $155,073. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the Companys financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the Companys results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 38 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers. Natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month. Crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers, revenues are recognized. Full Cost Method of Accounting The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Under this method, all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of, exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisitions, geological and geophysical work, day rate rentals and the costs of drilling, completing and equipping oil and gas wells. Costs, however, associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred. Interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties. Gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center. Proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs. The capitalized oil and gas property, less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes, if any, are generally limited to an amount (the ceiling limitation) equal to the sum of: (a) the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of 10% and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions; and (b) the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized. No ceiling write downs were recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004. Oil and Gas Reserves/Depletion Depreciation and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment, net of estimated salvage value, are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated, subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred. The Companys proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2006 were determined by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. Projecting the effects of commodity prices on production, and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the Companys control. 39 The future estimates of net cash flows from the Companys proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices, and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time. Any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells. Management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs, discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 12%. Quarterly, management accretes the 12% discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB published Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), (SFAS 123(R)) Share Based Payment. SFAS 123(R) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS 123(R) eliminated the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally required that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123(R) applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date and as a consequence future employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation plans will be recorded as expense over the vesting period of the award based on their fair values at the date the stock based compensation is granted. The cumulative effect of initially applying SFAS 123(R) is to be recognized as of the required effective date using a modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method the Company recognized stock based compensation expense from July 1, 2005 as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all outstanding unvested employee awards granted, modified or settled in prior years. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) in 2005 and recognized $84,030 in compensation expense for options granted in 2005 and $128,197 in 2006. The Company will recognize $141,524 in 2007 and 2008 in compensation expense relating to those options granted in 2005. The ultimate impact on future years results of operation and financial position will depend upon the level of stock based compensation granted in future years. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109" ("FIN 48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. FIN 48 provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is "more likely than not" to be sustained if the position were to be 40 challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. If an uncertain tax position meets the "more likely than not" threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority, is recorded. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Consistent with the requirements of FIN 48, we adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 and do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt Obligations11 $2,795,801 $65,267 $2,730,534 $ 0 $ 0 Capital Lease Obligations $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Operating Lease Obligations12 $95,019 $63,346 $31,673 $ 0 $ 0 Purchase Obligations $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Other Long Term Liabilities $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Total $2,890,820 $128,613 $2,762,207 $ 0 $ 0 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS Commodity Risk The Companys major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue. Monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of $51.74 per barrel to a high of $68.82 per barrel during 2006. Gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of $4.20 per Mcf to a monthly high of $11.55 per Mcf during the same period. The Company did not enter into any hedging agreements in 2006 to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations. 11 See, Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 12 See, Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. 41 Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006, the Company had debt outstanding of approximately $2,795,801 including, as of that date, $2,600,000 owed on its credit facility with Citibank Texas, N. A. The interest rate on the Citibank credit facility is variable at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.5%. The Companys remaining debt of $195,801 has fixed interest rates ranging from 5.5% to 8.25%. As a result, the Companys annual interest costs in 2006 fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately 93% of its total debt outstanding at December 31, 2006. The impact on interest expense and the Companys cash flows of a 10 percent increase in the interest rate on the Citibank Credit facility would be approximately $21,128, assuming borrowed amounts under the Citibank credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of December 31, 2006. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at December 31, 2006. Forward Looking Statements And Risk Certain statements in this report, including statements of the future plans, objectives, and expected performance of the Company, are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside the Companys control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the market prices of oil and gas, economic and competitive conditions, inflation rates, legislative and regulatory changes, financial market conditions, political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments, future business decisions, and other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates. The drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates and cost overruns. Lease and rig availability, complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks. Additionally, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, or a prolonged period of low prices, may substantially adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
