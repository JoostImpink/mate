Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. Please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated, discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements below. Executive Summary We are the second largest non hazardous solid waste management company in the United States, as measured by revenues. We provide non hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services in 37 states and Puerto Rico, geographically identified as the Midwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern, Southwestern and Western regions. Our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services. We generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities. Commercial and municipal contract terms generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options. Our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and landfills that we operate on behalf of municipalities and others. We consistently invest capital to support the ongoing operations of our landfill and collection business. Landfills are highly engineered, sophisticated facilities similar to civil works. Each year we invest capital at our 161 owned or operated active landfills to provide sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle. In addition, we have approximately 12,000 collection vehicles and approximately 1.2 million containers to serve our collection customers. Our vehicles and containers endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely maintained and replaced. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we invested $670 million of capital into the business (see Note 3, Property and Equipment, for detail by fixed asset category). In 2008, total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million. Cash flows in our business are generally predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base and the essential service we provide to the communities where we operate. This predictability has enabled us to consistently reinvest in the business and to service our debt obligations. As a result, we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own and we have paid cash to acquire existing cash flow streams. This financial model should continue to allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we continue to use our cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business to reduce our debt balance. During the first and third quarters of 2007, we sold hauling, transfer, recycling and landfill operations in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions as well as the stock in an unrelated immaterial subsidiary for net proceeds of approximately $159.3 million. The combined losses from the sale of these assets of $32.6 million, primarily relating to the write off of associated goodwill of $95.7 million, were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. We sold certain operations during 2007 which did not qualify as discontinued operations for net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million and recognized net loss on divestitures of $13.4 million, including divested goodwill of $3.4 million. The loss was primarily attributable to divested operations in our Southeastern region. Additionally, we recognized asset impairments of $27.1 million, of which $24.5 million related to a landfill in our Midwestern region that until recently, was managed by a third party according to a partnership agreement. These charges were included in Loss on divestitures and asset impairments in our consolidated statement of operations. 28 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased to $309.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, from $155.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income, inclusive of higher losses from divestitures and asset impairments, and lower interest and income tax expenses. Our organic revenue growth was 2.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Revenue during 2007 increased across all lines of business except for our roll off and landfill disposal lines of business. Operating income, inclusive of higher losses from divestitures and asset impairments in 2007, increased by $101.1 million over the same period in 2006, driven by improvements in revenue primarily as a result of price growth, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs of operations remained comparable to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of higher compensation as a result of improved performance in 2007. Loss on divestitures and asset impairments increased by $18.0 million, primarily due to an asset impairment charge associated with a landfill in the Midwestern region resulting from changes in anticipated long term closure and post closure costs. Interest expense for 2007 decreased by $25.0 million compared to 2006 as a result of interest savings associated with the decrease in our outstanding debt balance as well as lower interest rates from the refinancing transactions during the year. Interest expense in 2007 included $59.6 million of premiums paid and write off of deferred financing costs associated with our bond redemptions and other financing activities. Income tax expense for 2007 decreased by $28.2 million compared to 2006 as a result of $24.6 million of income tax benefits recognized in 2007 primarily associated with the reversal of accrued interest expense on uncertain tax matters as a result of favorable developments during the year, and the absence in 2007 of $58.2 million of income tax charges recognized in 2006 primarily associated with interest charges and adjustments applicable to prior years, partially offset by increased tax expense in 2007 associated with higher pre tax income. Our pricing programs and operational effectiveness initiatives continue to drive improved profitability and improved returns on invested capital. These programs contributed to our cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreasing to 62.4% in 2007 compared to 64.1% in 2006. In addition, we continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital by evaluating the return potential of new capital expenditures and by evaluating opportunities to divest operations that do not provide an adequate return. Accordingly, we divested of operations primarily in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions during 2007. We spent $670 million on capital expenditures during 2007. We plan to invest approximately $650 million in capital expenditures during 2008, a portion of which relates to investment in our fleet. We expect this investment, along with improved maintenance practices, to continue to have a favorable impact on maintenance costs and route productivity. Maintenance and repairs for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased approximately 1.8% from prior year as we continued to benefit from a newer fleet coupled with improved maintenance practices implemented throughout the past three years. We employed a strategy of reducing our debt balance by using our cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business. As this occurs, the relative cost of debt has declined. Upon achieving optimal credit ratios, we should have the opportunity to choose the best use of any excess cash flow: further repay debt, pay a dividend to the extent permitted by our debt agreements, repurchase stock or reinvest in our company. We may take advantage of opportunities that arise to repay debt in advance of maturities as long as the opportunities are economically advantageous. We also explore and evaluate other ways to enhance shareholder value. Accordingly, where appropriate we may pursue acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions or investments in our business that complement or enhance our strategic position, services, geographical footprint or assets, or otherwise drive shareholder value. In March 2007, we issued $750 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2017 and used the proceeds to fund a portion of our tender offer for our 8.50% senior notes due 2008. We also completed the amendment to our 2005 Credit Facility, which included re pricing the 2005 Revolver and a two year 29 Table of Contents maturity extension for all facilities under the 2005 Credit Facility. The interest rate and fees for borrowings and letters of credit under the 2005 Revolver were reduced by 75 basis points. In addition, our fee for the unused portion of the 2005 Revolver was reduced by 37.5 basis points. We expensed approximately $45.4 million of costs related to premiums paid, write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with these transactions. We expect the refinancing transactions to generate approximately $15 million in annual interest savings. In May 2007, we renewed and increased our accounts receivable securitization program from $230 million to $300 million. Additionally, we increased the accounts receivable securitization program by $100 million to $400 million in October 2007. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we made prepayments of $203 million and $95 million, respectively, on the 2005 Term Loan. These payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the upsizing of our securitization program and the sale of assets. In September 2007, we redeemed $250 million of our 9.25% senior notes due 2012 with available cash and a temporary borrowing under the 2005 Revolver. We expensed $13.3 million of costs related to premiums paid, write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with the redemption. We expect the bond redemption to generate approximately $5 million in annual interest savings. Throughout 2007, we completed four offerings of unsecured tax exempt bonds with an aggregate value of $116.8 million, the proceeds of which are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer and hauling facilities. The tax exempt bonds mature between 2015 and 2018. We continue to focus on maximizing cash flow from operations after capital expenditures and other investments in our business. We seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through reductions in interest cost while continuing to support our fixed asset base with appropriate capital expenditures, and where appropriate, pursue acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions or investments in our business that complement or enhance our strategic position, services, geographical footprint or assets, or otherwise drive shareholder value. Our debt to total capitalization ratio was 63.0% and 65.8% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Subsequent events In January 2008, we repaid $161.2 million of our 6.375% senior notes at the stated maturity with available cash. We also completed an offering of $33.9 million variable rate, unsecured tax exempt bonds maturing in 2024. Proceeds from the tax exempt bonds are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer and hauling facilities. On February 13, 2008, we paid to the IRS $196 million for tax and interest related to our 1999 income tax return. This payment does not represent a settlement with respect to the potential tax, interest or penalty related to this matter nor does it prevent us from contesting the IRS tax adjustment applicable to our 1999 taxable year in a federal refund action. At the end of January 2008, we reduced our workforce by approximately 2%. In mid February 2008, we realigned our organizational structure and reduced the number of our geographic regions from five to four. The workforce adjustment demonstrates the operating efficiencies realized from our standardized practices. The regional realignment reflects the development of our management team and organizational effectiveness and will allow us to redirect resources into other areas of the business to derive additional future benefits. We anticipate estimated labor savings from these actions of approximately $20 million, net of the related restructuring charge of approximately $10 million, which will be incurred in the first quarter of 2008. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth our results of operations and percentage relationship that the various items bear to revenues for the periods indicated (in millions, except percentages). Statement of Operations Data: Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 6,068.7 100.0 % $ 5,908.5 100.0 % $ 5,612.2 100.0 % Cost of operations 3,787.1 62.4 3,786.4 64.1 3,654.6 65.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 631.9 10.4 587.3 9.9 510.2 9.1 Depreciation and amortization 553.5 9.1 557.7 9.4 543.6 9.7 Loss from divestitures and asset impairments 40.5 0.7 22.5 0.4 Operating income 1,055.7 17.4 954.6 16.2 903.8 16.1 Interest expense and other 538.4 8.9 563.4 9.6 583.1 10.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 517.3 8.5 391.2 6.6 320.7 5.7 Income tax expense 207.1 3.4 235.3 4.0 131.1 2.3 Minority interests 0.4 0.0 0.1 0.0 (0.2 ) 0.0 Income from continuing operations 309.8 5.1 155.8 2.6 189.8 3.4 Discontinued operations, net of tax (36.2 ) (0.6 ) 5.1 0.1 14.8 0.2 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax (0.8 ) 0.0 Net income 273.6 4.5 160.9 2.7 203.8 3.6 Dividends on preferred stock (37.5 ) (0.6 ) (42.9 ) 0.7 (52.0 ) 0.9 Net income available to common shareholders $ 236.1 3.9 $ 118.0 2.0 % $ 151.8 2.7 % Revenues. We generate revenues primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services. Although we consider our core business to be our collection and disposal operations, we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities. We record revenue as the services are provided, with revenue deferred in instances where customers are billed in advance of the service being provided. National Accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas, and as such, the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset by the corresponding subcontract costs. The following table shows our total reported revenues by service line. Intercompany revenues have been eliminated. Revenues by service line (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Collection Residential $ 1,201.6 $ 1,190.0 $ 1,172.2 Commercial 1,535.5 1,457.0 1,356.7 Roll off (1) 1,290.3 1,304.5 1,223.8 Recycling 210.2 189.8 186.4 Total Collection 4,237.6 4,141.3 3,939.1 Disposal Landfill 832.7 839.2 798.4 Transfer 436.0 423.1 420.7 Total Disposal 1,268.7 1,262.3 1,219.1 Recycling Commodity 257.2 212.2 219.7 Other(2) 305.2 292.7 234.3 Total Revenues $ 6,068.7 $ 5,908.5 $ 5,612.2 (1) Consists of revenue generated from commercial, industrial and residential customers from waste collected in roll off containers that are loaded onto collection vehicles. (2) Consists primarily of revenue from our National Accounts business where the work has been subcontracted, revenue generated from transporting waste via railway or truck and revenue from liquid waste disposal. 31 Table of Contents Our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic region. At December 31, 2007, we operated in 124 markets in 37 states and Puerto Rico. Our regional teams focus on developing local markets in which we can operate a vertically integrated operation and maximize operating efficiency. As a result, we may choose not to operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met. Effective October 1, 2005, we modified our field organizational structure by reducing the number of our operating regions to five from nine, realigning some of our districts among the regions and increasing our regional support staff to add functional expertise and oversight in areas that are aligned with our strategic value drivers. The following table shows our revenues by geographic region in total and as a percentage of total revenues. Revenues by region (1) (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Midwestern $ 1,236.4 20.4 % $ 1,210.3 20.4 % $ 1,175.2 20.9 % Northeastern 1,258.3 20.7 1,256.6 21.3 1,247.2 22.2 Southeastern 965.1 15.9 965.5 16.3 900.8 16.1 Southwestern 1,027.4 16.9 991.6 16.8 939.6 16.7 Western 1,435.3 23.7 1,351.2 22.9 1,265.4 22.6 Other(2) 146.2 2.4 133.3 2.3 84.0 1.5 Total Revenues $ 6,068.7 100.0 % $ 5,908.5 100.0 % $ 5,612.2 100.0 % (1) See discussion in Note 17, Segment Reporting, to our consolidated financial statements. (2) Amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries that provide services throughout the organization and not on a regional basis. Cost of operations. Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment, and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our National Accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel credits; disposal and franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes landfill accretion, financial assurance, leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and costs; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent, and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations. The following table provides the components of our cost of operations and as a percentage of revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Labor and related benefits $ 1,078.9 17.8 % $ 1,092.0 18.5 % $ 1,090.1 19.4 % Transfer and disposal costs 452.5 7.5 475.3 8.0 471.9 8.4 Maintenance and repairs 482.5 8.0 491.5 8.3 485.5 8.7 Transportation and subcontractor costs 505.8 8.3 507.4 8.6 446.6 8.0 Fuel 308.7 5.1 291.6 4.9 235.8 4.2 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 362.0 6.0 365.5 6.2 347.7 6.2 Landfill operating costs 162.1 2.7 148.0 2.5 147.6 2.6 Risk management 154.1 2.5 166.0 2.8 171.0 3.0 Cost of goods sold 73.9 1.2 54.3 0.9 45.2 0.8 Other 206.6 3.3 194.8 3.4 213.2 3.8 Total cost of operations $ 3,787.1 62.4 % $ 3,786.4 64.1 % $ 3,654.6 65.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems and clerical and administrative departments. It also includes rent and office 32 Table of Contents costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, such as accountants, lawyers and consultants, provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable and other expenses such as marketing, investor and community relations, directors and officers insurance, employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges. The following table provides the components of our selling, general and administrative costs and as a percentage of revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Salaries $ 396.4 6.5 % $ 358.7 6.1 % $ 319.6 5.7 % Rent and office costs 39.2 0.6 40.3 0.7 40.2 0.7 Professional fees 64.8 1.1 56.9 1.0 50.7 0.9 Provision for doubtful accounts 19.9 0.3 18.3 0.3 17.8 0.3 Other 111.6 1.9 113.1 1.8 81.9 1.5 Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 631.9 10.4 % $ 587.3 9.9 % $ 510.2 9.1 % Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of costs associated with the acquisition, development and retirement of landfill airspace and intangible assets. Depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. The estimated useful lives of assets are: buildings and improvements (30 40 years), vehicles and equipment (3 15 years), containers and compactors (5 10 years) and furniture and office equipment (4 8 years). For building improvements, the depreciable life can be the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or related lease terms. Landfill assets are amortized at a rate per ton of waste disposed. (See Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of landfill accounting.) Depreciation expense of vehicles increases as fully depreciated trucks are replaced by new vehicles. Landfill assets are amortized at a rate per ton of waste disposed. Amortization of landfill assets is impacted by several factors including rates of inflation, landfill expansions and compaction rates. The following tables provide the components of our depreciation and amortization and as a percentage of revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Depreciation of fixed assets $ 323.2 5.3 % $ 311.5 5.3 % $ 298.1 5.3 % Landfill and other amortization 230.3 3.8 246.2 4.1 245.5 4.4 Total depreciation and amortization $ 553.5 9.1 % $ 557.7 9.4 % $ 543.6 9.7 % Landfill disposal capacity and operating lives. We had available landfill disposal capacity of approximately 2.9 billion tons as of December 31, 2007. We classify this disposal capacity as either permitted (having received the final permit from the governing authorities) or probable expansion. Probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable. Throughout the year, 1 landfill was closed and 1 was divested, leaving 161 active landfills as of December 31, 2007. The number of sites with probable expansion disposal capacity increased to 25 from 21 in the prior year as new probable expansions were added at 10 sites and 6 sites were reclassified from probable expansion due to successful expansions. In addition to these 6 sites, we had increases in overall permitted capacity at 13 sites where the disposal capacity was not previously classified as probable expansion. (See Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates and Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for our requirements to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion.) 33 Table of Contents The following table reflects disposal capacity activity for active landfills we owned or operated for the year ended December 31, 2007 (disposal capacity in millions of tons): Probable Permitted Expansion Disposal Disposal Total Disposal Capacity Capacity Capacity Balance as of December 31, 2006 2,527.3 278.1 2,805.4 Acquisitions, divestitures and closures 63.0 1.1 64.1 Additions to probable expansion disposal capacity 28.5 28.5 Net change to permitted disposal capacity 50.1 (33.9 ) 16.2 Disposal capacity consumed (73.2 ) (73.2 ) Changes in engineering estimates (1) 68.5 14.0 82.5 Balance as of December 31, 2007 2,635.7 287.8 2,923.5 (1) Relates primarily to increased density of waste at our landfills resulting from improved operational procedures, optimization of daily cover materials and improved utilization of compaction equipment. The following table reflects the estimated remaining operating lives of our landfill assets based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes: At December 31, 2007 At December 31, 2006 Number of Sites Percent of Total Number of Sites Percent of Total 0 to 5 years 23 14 % 31 19 % 5 to 10 years 8 5 8 5 10 to 20 years 42 26 47 29 20 to 40 years 48 30 38 23 40 years 40 25 39 24 Total 161 100 % 163 100 % Interest expense and other includes the following components (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense and other Interest expense, gross $ 486.5 $ 526.2 $ 519.8 Interest income (5.9 ) (4.2 ) (3.0 ) Interest capitalized for development projects (19.2 ) (17.2 ) (14.1 ) Accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs 20.5 21.8 22.7 Costs incurred to early extinguish debt 59.6 41.3 62.6 Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations (3.1 ) (4.5 ) (4.9 ) Total interest expense and other from continuing operations $ 538.4 $ 563.4 $ 583.1 Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Revenues increased 2.7% over the prior year. The revenue increase within the collection business was primarily attributable to the increases in the commercial and recycling lines of business. Disposal revenue increased as the increase in transfer revenue more than offset the decrease in landfill revenue. Recycling commodity revenue increased due to cardboard and newspaper commodity price increases. Other revenue increased as a result of increases associated with the subcontracted portion of our National Accounts. Following is a summary of the change in revenues (in millions): Reported revenues in 2006 $ 5,908.5 Core business organic growth Increase from average base per unit price change 306.9 Increase from fuel recovery fees 25.4 Decrease from net volume change (191.6 ) Net divested revenues and adjustments (11.6 ) Increase in recycling and other 31.1 Reported revenues in 2007 $ 6,068.7 34 Table of Contents We analyze our revenue by organic growth, which excludes the effect of net divested revenues and adjustments, and revenue from recycling and other. We generated organic revenue growth of 2.5% and 6.8% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue increased $332.3 million, or 6.0% from core business pricing growth during 2007. Within the collection business, average per unit pricing increased 8.5%, 4.9%, 3.8% and 14.6%, respectively, in the commercial, roll off, residential and recycling collection lines of business. Within the disposal line of business, landfill and transfer average per unit pricing increased 6.0% and 5.7%, respectively. The fuel recovery fee program, implemented in 2005 to mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices, generated $25.4 million, or 7.6% of the total price growth in 2007. This fee fluctuates with the price of fuel and, consequently, any increase in fuel prices would result in an increase in our revenue, which should be more than offset by an increase in our fuel expense. Core business volume decreased 3.5% for 2007 compared to prior year, primarily due to volume decreases in the roll off and landfill lines of business. Within the collection business, the commercial, roll off, residential and recycling collection lines of business experienced volume declines of 2.1%, 6.1%, 2.7% and 4.8% during 2007. Within the disposal business, landfill and transfer volume decreased 7.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The volume decreases were primarily attributable to conditions reflective of the general economy, in particular the decline in the housing market, and to a lesser extent, customer loss from pricing increases. Cost of operations. Cost of operations in 2007 remained comparable to the prior year, driven by decreases in transfer and disposal costs, labor costs and risk management expenses, partially offset by increases in cost of goods sold, landfill operating costs and fuel expenses. Transfer and disposal costs decreased primarily due to volume decreases during the year. The decrease in labor costs is attributable to lower volume as well as the continued benefits from our headcount reduction initiative in 2006 and our operating efficiency programs. The decrease in risk management expenses was attributable to favorable adjustments associated with risk and health insurance resulting from favorable claims experience. Cost of goods sold increased in 2007 due to increases in commodity pricing. The increase in landfill operating costs is primarily attributable to increased accretion expense, landfill maintenance and higher leachate costs. Fuel costs increased due to higher market rates, partially offset by decline in volume. Our fixed price purchase contracts expired as of March 31, 2006, and, unless new contracts are executed, all future fuel purchases will be at market rates. When economically practical, we may enter into new or renew contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. We expect that our fuel recovery fee will offset a portion of the volatility in fuel costs arising from future market price fluctuations. At December 31, 2007, approximately 57% of our customers participated in the fuel recovery fee program. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in salaries and professional fees. The increase in salaries included the impact of annual compensation adjustments and higher incentive compensation as a result of improved performance in 2007. The increase in professional fees in 2007 was attributable to our pricing and procurement initiatives, billing system conversion and organizational development activities during the year. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.8% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Depreciation expense related to vehicles and equipment increased primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in recent years. Landfill amortization decreased in 2007 compared to the prior year due to reduced landfill amortization rates and disposal volume. Loss from divestitures and asset impairments. During 2007, we recognized loss on divestitures and asset impairments of $40.5 million. Divestitures throughout the year which did not qualify as discontinued operations generated a net loss of $13.4 million, of which $16.2 million related to the divestiture of certain operations in the Southeastern region in the third quarter of 2007. Also during 2007, we completed the evaluation of the long term closure and post closure obligations at one of our landfills in the Midwestern region that, until recently, was managed by a third party according to 35 Table of Contents a partnership agreement. The evaluation indicated an increase in the asset retirement obligation and a resulting impairment of the landfill asset totaling $24.5 million. During 2006, we recorded losses of approximately $22.5 million related to divestitures and asset impairments. Asset sales, completed as a result of our market rationalization focus, generated a loss of approximately $7.6 million. These losses primarily related to operations in our Northeastern and Midwestern regions. During 2006, we also recorded landfill asset impairment charges of approximately $9.7 million as a result of managements decision to discontinue development and or operations of three landfill sites. Additionally, during 2006 we recognized a $5.2 million expense associated with the relocation of our operations support center. Interest expense and other. Gross interest expense decreased 7.5% during 2007 as a result of debt repayments and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. In connection with the repayment and refinancing transactions during 2007 and 2006, we incurred costs to early extinguish and refinance debt of $59.6 million and $41.3 million, respectively, relating to premiums paid, write off of deferred financing and other costs. Income tax expense. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 40.1% compared to 60.2% in 2006. Income tax expense decreased by $28.2 million or 12.0% from $235.3 million in 2006 to $207.1 million in 2007 as a result of $24.6 million of income tax benefits recognized in 2007 and the absence in 2007 of $58.2 million of income tax charges recognized in 2006, partially offset by increased income tax expense in 2007 associated with higher pre tax income. The income tax benefits recognized in 2007 included $17.0 million from the reversal of previously accrued interest expense on uncertain tax matters as a result of favorable developments during the year, and $7.6 million relating primarily to state tax adjustments. The income tax charges recognized in 2006 included $21.5 million of interest expense on previously recorded liabilities under review by the applicable taxing authorities, $13.4 million in adjustments relating to state tax matters attributable to prior years, a $12.0 million increase in our valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards and $11.3 million relating primarily to adjustments of state income taxes. Discontinued operations. During 2007, we sold certain operations in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions for net proceeds of approximately $159.3 million. The results of these operations, including those related to prior years, have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We recognized losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $38.0 million primarily from the write off of goodwill in 2007. There were no divestitures in 2006 that had been presented as discontinued operations. In 2007 and 2006, we recognized net income from discontinued operations of $1.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Dividends on preferred stock. Dividends on preferred stock were $37.5 million and $42.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease of $5.4 million in 2007 resulted from the conversion of Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock (Series C preferred stock) on April 1, 2006 into approximately 34.1 million shares of common stock, eliminating approximately $21.6 million in annual dividends. Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Revenues increased 5.3% over the prior year, as all lines of business increased except for recycling commodity. The revenue increase within the collection business was primarily driven by increases in the commercial and roll off lines of business. The revenue increase within the disposal business was primarily attributable to landfill revenue increases. Recycling revenue decreased due to cardboard and newspaper commodity price declines as well as volume declines. Other revenue increased as a result of waste volume increases associated with the subcontracted portion of our National Accounts. 36 Table of Contents Following is a summary of the change in revenues (in millions): Reported revenues in 2005 $ 5,612.2 Core business organic growth Increase from average base per unit price change 197.9 Increase from fuel recovery fees 99.3 Increase from net volume change 54.8 Net divested revenues and adjustments (57.6 ) Increase in recycling and other 1.9 Reported revenues in 2006 $ 5,908.5 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we generated organic revenue growth of 6.8%, of which $297.2 million or 5.7% was attributable to our average price per unit on core business. Our continued price growth reflected the results of pricing increases implemented throughout the year. Within the collection business, average per unit pricing increased 7.2%, 7.2%, 3.4% and 13.1%, respectively, in the commercial, roll off, residential and recycling collection lines of business for the year ended December 31, 2006. Within the disposal line of business, landfill and transfer average per unit pricing increased 4.5% and 4.1%, respectively. The fuel recovery fee program, implemented in 2005 to mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices, generated 33% of the total price growth for the year ended December 31, 2006. This fee fluctuates with the price of fuel; and, consequently, fuel price declines would result in a decrease in our revenue, which would be more than offset by a decrease in our fuel expense. Core business volume growth was 1.1% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by volume increases related to subcontract and transportation revenues. Within the collection business, the commercial and roll off lines of business experienced volume increases of 1.0% and 1.1%, respectively. Volume for the residential line of business decreased slightly while recycling collection volume declined 6.5% during 2006. Within the disposal business, both landfill and transfer volumes decreased by 0.7%. The decline in landfill volume was primarily due to reductions in special waste volumes in the current year. We improved our pricing structure and return criteria for special waste jobs in an effort to improve the returns on this area of landfill volume. Subcontract and transportation volume increased 50.2% and 9.5%, respectively, primarily driven by the growth associated with our National Accounts in 2006. Cost of operations. Cost of operations increased 3.6% in 2006 compared to the prior year, driven by increases in fuel, transportation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by decreases in risk management and other expenses. The increase in transportation and subcontractor costs primarily reflected our volume growth in our National Accounts and fuel cost increases. Risk management costs decreased due to favorable adjustments associated with risk and health insurance resulting from favorable claims experience. Other expense decreased partly as a result of an $8 million favorable adjustment to our environmental reserves in 2006, primarily due to the selection by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of a lower cost remediation plan for a Superfund site at which we are a potentially responsible party. Fuel costs increased because of higher fuel prices and the expiration of certain fixed price purchase contracts. A significant portion of these contracts expired in early 2005. Our fixed price purchase contracts expired as of March 31, 2006, and, unless new contracts are executed, all future fuel purchases will be at market rates. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the contracts in place reduced fuel costs by $5.9 million when compared to then current market prices. We expect that our fuel recovery fee will offset a portion of the volatility in fuel costs arising from future market price fluctuations. At December 31, 2006, approximately 57% of our customers participated in the fuel recovery fee program. Labor costs remained constant in 2006 primarily due to our on going labor efficiency efforts. Maintenance and repairs costs increased only slightly compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increased level of vehicle purchases and improved maintenance practices in the prior two years. These costs actually declined in the second half of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. 37 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15.1% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relating to salaries, professional fees and other expenses. The increase in salaries included the impact of higher incentive compensation resulting from improved performance in 2006, severance costs associated with an initiative to control labor costs and other unrelated separations that occurred during 2006. In addition, the increase in salaries in 2006 also reflected the impact of normal inflation, benefits costs and stock option expense recognized due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006. Professional fees increased as a result of consulting fees related to initiatives to standardize sales programs, invest in National Accounts systems improvements and implement procurement programs during the year. The increase in other expense was primarily attributable to a $22.1 million reversal of litigation reserves during 2005. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005. Depreciation expense related to vehicles and equipment increased primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in recent periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, landfill amortization increased slightly due to increased amortization rates, partially offset by volume decreases. Loss from divestitures and asset impairments. During 2006, we recorded losses of approximately $22.5 million related to divestitures and asset impairments. Asset sales, completed as a result of our market rationalization focus, generated a loss of approximately $7.6 million. These losses primarily related to operations in our Northeastern and Midwestern regions. During 2006, we also recorded landfill asset impairment charges of approximately $9.7 million as a result of managements decision to discontinue development and or operations of three landfill sites. Additionally, during 2006 we recognized a $5.2 million expense associated with the relocation of our operations support center. Interest expense and other. Interest expense and other decreased by 3.4% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Gross interest expense increased slightly during the year as a result of rising interest rates on the variable portion of our debt, offset by lower debt levels as a result of our continued de leveraging strategy and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in the first quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2006. In connection with the refinancing transactions, we incurred costs to early extinguish and refinance debt of $41.3 million and $62.6 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Income tax expense. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 60.2% compared to 40.9% in 2005. Income tax expense increased by $104.2 million or 79.3% from $131.1 million in 2005 to $235.3 million in 2006 primarily due to increased pre tax income. Other factors contributing to the increase included $21.5 million of interest expense on previously recorded liabilities under review by the applicable taxing authorities, $13.4 million in adjustments relating to state tax matters attributable to prior years, a $12.0 million increase in our valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards and $11.3 million relating primarily to adjustments of state income taxes. In 2005, income tax expense was reduced by a $25.5 million benefit related to additional stock basis associated with a divestiture. Discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2006 relate to our sale certain operations in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions in 2007 and our sale of hauling, transfer and recycling operations in Florida, as well as the stock of an unrelated immaterial subsidiary in a single transaction during the first quarter of 2007. There were no divestitures during 2006 that have been presented as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2006 included $8.3 million of pre tax income from operations ($5.1 million income, net of tax). Dividends on preferred stock. Dividends on preferred stock were $42.9 million and $52.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted from the conversion of the Series C preferred stock into approximately 34.1 million shares of common stock on April 1, 2006, eliminating approximately $21.6 million of annual dividends. This decrease was partially offset as a result of having the Series D 38 Table of Contents mandatory convertible preferred stock (Series D preferred stock) issued in March 2005 outstanding for the full year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure consists of 63% debt and 37% equity at December 31, 2007. The majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies between 1990 and 2000. We incurred and assumed over $11 billion of debt to acquire BFI in 1999. Since the acquisition of BFI, we have repaid debt with cash flow from operations, asset sales and the issuance of equity. We intend to continue to use our cash flows after capital expenditures to improve long term shareholder returns. This could include continued debt payment, investments in operating assets and strategic assets or other investments in our business. We believe that additional debt repayment should reduce our cost of debt, increase liquidity and provide more flexibility in evaluating the most appropriate use of our cash flow to improve shareholder value. We may refinance or repay portions of our debt to maintain a capital structure that supports our operating plan, as well as continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in the future with actions that are economically beneficial. The potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations, asset sales and capital markets transactions. We continue to evaluate the performance of and opportunities to divest operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies or provide an adequate return on invested capital. Capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer maturities, issuance of equity, or a combination of both. We generally meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flows. Our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital, capital expenditures for vehicles, containers and landfill development, capping, closure, post closure and environmental expenditures, debt service costs, cash taxes, and scheduled debt maturities. When we cannot meet our short term liquidity needs with operating cash flow, we meet those needs with borrowings under our 2005 Credit Facility. We have a $1.575 billion commitment until 2012 under our 2005 Credit Facility, which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs based on current conditions. At December 31, 2007, we had no loans outstanding and $352.4 million in letters of credit drawn on the 2005 Revolver, leaving approximately $1.223 billion of availability capacity. Both the $25 million Incremental Revolving Letter of Credit Facility and $485 million Institutional Letter of Credit Facility were fully utilized at December 31, 2007. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we made prepayments of $203 million and $95 million, respectively, on the 2005 Term Loan. These payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the increase in our securitization program and the sale of assets. 39 Table of Contents Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three years were as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Operating Activities: Net income $ 273.6 $ 160.9 $ 203.8 Discontinued operations, net of tax 36.2 (5.1 ) (14.8 ) Non cash expenses (1) 794.1 811.2 702.1 Change in working capital (2) (15.7 ) (78.8 ) (132.4 ) Capping, closure, post closure and environmental expenditures, net of accretion (22.0 ) (35.9 ) (41.1 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 1,066.2 852.3 717.6 Investing Activities: Proceeds from divestitures less the cost of acquisitions, net of cash divested/acquired (3) 80.7 50.4 0.9 Proceeds from sale of fixed assets 25.8 21.7 20.2 Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions (670.0 ) (661.1 ) (685.6 ) Capitalized interest (19.2 ) (17.2 ) (14.1 ) Change in deferred acquisition costs, notes receivable and other 4.6 6.1 Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations (582.7 ) (601.6 ) (672.5 ) Financing Activities: Net proceeds from sale of Series D preferred stock 580.8 Proceeds from long term debt, net of issuance costs 1,502.2 1,239.3 3,043.5 Payments of long term debt (1,914.1 ) (1,438.4 ) (3,740.2 ) Payment of preferred stock dividends (37.5 ) (48.3 ) (48.9 ) Net receipts from restricted trust 90.7 Net proceeds from sale of common stock, exercise of stock options and other 23.9 23.6 97.4 Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations (334.8 ) (223.8 ) (67.4 ) Cash (used for) provided by discontinued operations (11.9 ) 11.1 10.4 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 136.8 $ 38.0 $ (11.9 ) (1) Consists principally of provisions for depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs, write off of deferred debt issuance costs, non cash reduction in acquisition accruals, non cash asset impairments and loss on divestitures, non cash gain on sale of fixed assets, deferred income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of tax. (2) Includes the net change in checks outstanding related to our primary disbursement account of $13.1 million, $47.3 million and $21.9 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which was previously classified with financing activities, See Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. (3) During 2007, we acquired solid waste operations representing approximately $34.5 million ($34.5 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues and sold operations representing approximately $150.7 million ($132.2 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues. During 2006, we acquired solid waste operations representing approximately $8.3 million ($8.2 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues and sold operations representing approximately $116.2 million ($103.6 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues. During 2005, we acquired solid waste operations representing approximately $19.5 million ($19.5 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues and sold operations representing approximately $16.4 million ($16.4 million, net of intercompany eliminations) in annual revenues. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased 25% in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income after adjusting for the impact of deferred taxes and a decreased use of working capital of approximately $22.0 million, primarily related to the timing of operating activities and capital expenditure disbursements. Cash used for investing activities declined by 3% over 2006, as a result of the increase of approximately $30.3 million in proceeds from divestitures, net of costs of acquisitions offset by slightly higher capital expenditures. Higher repayments offset by higher proceeds from long term debt and net receipts from restricted trust are the primary drivers in the 50% increase of cash used for financing activities. 40 Table of Contents Following is a summary of the primary sources and uses of cash during 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): Sources of cash: 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by continuing operations $ 1,066.2 $ 852.3 $ 717.6 Net proceeds from issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options 23.9 23.6 97.4 Net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock 580.8 Decrease in cash balance 11.9 Net receipts from restricted trust 90.7 Net proceeds from divestitures, net of acquisitions 80.7 50.4 0.9 Proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 25.8 21.7 20.2 Total $ 1,287.3 $ 948.0 $ 1,428.8 Uses of cash: 2007 2006 2005 Capital expenditures $ 670.0 $ 661.1 $ 685.6 Debt repayments, net of debt proceeds 390.0 187.4 666.8 Debt issuance costs 21.9 11.7 29.9 Increase in cash balance 136.8 38.0 Payment of preferred stock cash dividends 37.5 48.3 48.9 Other non operating net cash outflows (inflows) 31.1 1.5 (2.4 ) Total $ 1,287.3 $ 948.0 $ 1,428.8 Capital expenditures. In addition to funding our working capital needs and reducing debt, we are committed to efficiently investing in our capital asset base. Our goal is to generate returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital. Our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills, for the vehicles and containers used by our collection operations and for heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations. We maintain a level of annual capital expenditures in order to control repair and maintenance costs, improve productivity and improve quality of customer service. We expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million in 2008. We expect this investment, along with improved maintenance practices, to reduce the total cost of our truck fleet ownership. Following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31 (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Vehicles, containers and heavy equipment $ 346.4 $ 361.4 $ 370.1 Landfill development 266.1 247.2 264.7 Other (1) 57.5 52.5 50.8 Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions $ 670.0 $ 661.1 $ 685.6 (1) Includes land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and furniture and office equipment. Financing activities. We continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through improvements in operations and reduction of our interest cost. Historically, we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing and liquidity requirements. Under our 2005 Credit Facility, we are required to meet certain financial covenants. Our objective is to maintain sufficient surplus between the required covenant ratios and the actual ratios calculated according to the 2005 Credit Agreement. We monitor the surplus carefully and will seek to take action if the surplus becomes too small. We have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. We expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent they are available to us. We cannot assure you opportunities to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. (See also Debt Covenants in Contractual Obligations and Commitments.) Significant financing events in 2007. In March 2007, we issued $750 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2017 and used the proceeds to fund a portion of our tender offer for our 8.50% senior notes due 2008. We completed an amendment to our 2005 Credit Facility, which included re pricing the 2005 Revolver and a two year maturity extension for all facilities under the 2005 Credit Facility. The interest rate and fees for borrowings and letters of credit under the 2005 Revolver were reduced by 75 basis points. In addition, our fee for the unused portion of the 2005 Revolver was reduced by 37.5 basis points. We expensed approximately $45.4 million of costs related to premiums paid, 41 Table of Contents write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with these transactions. We expect the refinancing transactions to generate approximately $15 million in annual interest savings. In May 2007, we renewed and increased our accounts receivable securitization program from $230 million to $300 million. Additionally, we increased the accounts receivable securitization program by $100 million to $400 million in October 2007. During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, we made prepayments of $203 million and $95 million, respectively, on the 2005 Term Loan. These payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the upsizing of our securitization program and the sale of assets. In September 2007, we redeemed $250 million of 9.25% senior notes due 2012 with available cash and a temporary borrowing under the 2005 Revolver. We expensed $13.3 million of costs related to premiums paid, write off of deferred financing and other costs in connection with the redemption. We expect the bond redemption to generate approximately $5 million in annual interest savings. Throughout 2007, we completed four offerings of unsecured tax exempt bonds with an aggregate value of $116.8 million, the proceeds of which are used to finance qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer and hauling facilities. The tax exempt bonds mature between 2015 and 2018. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of our debt structure and the associated interest cost (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Ending Effective Annual Ending Effective Annual Debt Interest Interest Debt Interest Interest Debt Instrument Balance Rate (1) Expense Balance Rate (1) Expense Revolving credit facility (2) $ 6.98 % $ 11.5 $ 8.81 % $ 19.6 2005 Term loans 806.7 6.75 70.0 1,105.0 7.34 88.3 Senior secured notes 4,399.8 7.20 341.4 4,644.6 7.60 363.1 Senior unsecured notes 400.0 7.55 30.2 400.0 7.55 30.2 Senior subordinated convertible debenture 230.0 4.34 10.0 230.0 4.34 10.0 Receivables secured loan 393.7 6.37 17.2 230.0 6.02 13.1 Other 412.7 6.21 24.9 301.0 6.95 22.8 Total $ 6,642.9 6.96 $ 505.2 $ 6,910.6 7.37 $ 547.1 (1) Includes the effect of our interest costs incurred, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and premiums or discounts. (2) Reflects weighted average interest rate and excludes fees. There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006; the rate presented is the average of the Adjusted LIBOR rate and the ABR plus applicable margins. The following table outlines what we regard as our material, fixed, non cancelable contractual cash obligations, their payment dates and expirations. Amounts related to operating leases and purchase obligations are not recorded as a liability on our December 31, 2007 consolidated balance sheet and will be recorded as appropriate in future periods. This table excludes certain obligations that we have reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, such as pension obligations of $11.6 million, environmental liabilities of $189.6 million and income tax contingencies of $261.7 million for which the timing of payments is not determinable. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Recorded obligations: Long term debt principal (1) $ 555.9 $ 1.0 $ 374.1 $ 675.3 $ 0.5 $ 5,097.2 $ 6,704.0 Long term debt interest (1) 435.6 435.1 422.8 390.1 369.8 1,715.3 3,768.7 Capital lease principal 1.6 1.4 1.3 1.0 0.7 6.3 12.3 Capital lease interest 1.0 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.6 1.9 5.8 Capping, closure and post closure obligations 73.2 62.9 73.2 68.0 54.9 3,035.0 3,367.2 Income tax uncertainties 380.7 380.7 Other long term liabilities 102.2 65.9 43.7 33.1 24.4 98.2 367.5 Unrecorded obligations: Operating leases 40.3 34.9 28.5 23.8 19.8 106.4 253.7 Purchase obligations:(2) Royalties 3.2 6.4 8.2 8.7 9.3 169.0 204.8 Disposal related 101.6 65.3 40.9 35.3 31.3 59.3 333.7 Other 63.0 13.0 11.9 9.2 9.1 241.4 347.6 Total cash contractual obligations $ 1,758.3 $ 686.8 $ 1,005.3 $ 1,245.2 $ 520.4 $ 10,530.0 $ 15,746.0 (1) Amount represents scheduled principal and interest due (excluding discounts). Scheduled interest payment obligations are calculated using stated coupons for fixed debt and interest rates effective as of December 31, 2007 for variable rate debt. (2) Purchase obligations consist primarily of (i) disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements, and take or pay and put or pay agreements and (ii) other obligations including, committed capital expenditures and consulting services arrangements. Debt covenants. Our 2005 Credit Facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions, pay dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments and take certain other corporate actions. See Note 7, Long term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary financial covenants. At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our 2005 Credit Facility. We are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our 2005 Credit Facility, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the 2005 Credit Facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. This could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on the 2005 Credit Facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments, including our senior notes and, therefore, these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration of maturities were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under the 2005 Credit Facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the 2005 Credit Facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. Prepayments. Under our 2005 Credit Facility, if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels, we must prepay a portion of our Term Loan borrowings annually (prior to the stated maturity). To make these payments, if required, we may have to use the 2005 Revolver to accommodate cash timing differences. Factors primarily increasing Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the 2005 Credit Agreement, could include increases in operating cash flow, lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements, net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities. In addition, we are required to make prepayments on the 2005 Credit Facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the 2005 Credit Agreement, including asset sales and issuances of debt securities. Financial assurances. We are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post closure costs, and or related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits. The 43 Table of Contents amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs is determined by the applicable state environmental regulations, which vary by state. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurances required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurances during 2008, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change. At December 31, 2007, we had the following financial assurance instruments and collateral in place (in millions): Landfill Closure/ Contract Risk/Casualty Collateral for Post Closure Performance Insurance Obligations Total Insurance policies $ 680.5 $ $ $ $ 680.5 Surety bonds 644.9 492.5 1,137.4 Trust deposits 85.5 85.5 Letters of credit (1) 385.3 90.4 245.7 141.0 862.4 Total $ 1,796.2 $ 582.9 $ 245.7 $ 141.0 $ 2,765.8 (1) These amounts were issued under the 2005 Revolver, the Incremental Revolving Letter of Credit and the Institutional Letter of Credit Facility under our 2005 Credit Facility. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company. Since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur. Off Balance Sheet Financing We have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee any third party debt. Interest Rate Risk Management We believe it is important to have a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to provide financing flexibility. Our policy requires that no less than 70% of our total debt is fixed, either directly or effectively, through interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of our debt was fixed, all directly. From time to time, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Our strategy is to use interest rate swap agreements when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure and meet the objectives of our interest rate policy. These contracts are not entered into for trading purposes. At December 31, 2007, we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. 44 Table of Contents Contingencies For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 9, Income Taxes, and Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Related Party Transactions For a description of related party transactions, see Note 16, Related Party Transactions, to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our financial position and results of operations and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our reportable segments. We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in these accounting policies. Residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that we face after the application of our policies and processes which is generally outside of our control or forecasting ability. Landfill accounting Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein. Our landfill assets fall into the following two categories, each of which require accounting judgments and estimates: Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset. Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset. We use the life cycle accounting method for our landfills and the related capping, closure and post closure liabilities. In life cycle accounting, all capitalizable costs to acquire, develop and retire (close and monitor) a site are recorded as amortization expense as disposal capacity is consumed. Estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically (at least annually) based on aerial surveys. Landfill Development Costs Site permit. In order to develop, construct and operate a landfill, we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs prior to the receipt of all required permits. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process. These changes could make it more difficult and or costly to obtain a landfill permit. 45 Table of Contents Studies performed could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit. Revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset. Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment. Technical landfill design. Upon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design. These changes could make it more difficult and or costly to meet new design standards. Technical design requirements, as approved, may need modifications at some future point in time. Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit. Landfill disposal capacity. Included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. These factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction. The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill. Residual risks: Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements. The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste. Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. The number of tons/cubic yard varies by type of waste. Development costs. The types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred. 46 Table of Contents Residual risk: Actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes. Landfill development asset amortization. In order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfills operating life. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the landfills estimated remaining disposal capacity. The expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based upon market value. Amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors. Residual risk: Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment. On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually. Landfill Retirement Obligations We have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and post closure monitoring. Landfill capping. As individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above. Residual risk: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping, closure activities or post closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates. Closure and post closure monitoring. Closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed, we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap. 47 Table of Contents Landfill retirement obligation liability/asset. Estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually (2.5% in both 2007 and 2006). The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis. These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill. Capping, closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (8.0% in 2007 and 8.5% in 2006). The retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liability. This accretion expense is charged to cost of operations. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are made. A corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities. The retirement obligation asset is amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the recorded retirement obligation assets net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. Closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill. Residual risks: Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post closure liabilities. Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities. Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense. Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense. Amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate. On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities and corresponding retirement obligation asset. Changes in the asset resulting in changes to the amortization rates are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. Disposal capacity. As described previously, disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, which relate to 48 Table of Contents additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable. Our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows: We have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought. All geological and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met, or an exception from such requirements has been received (or can reasonably be expected to be received). The political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved. We are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local, state and federal permits will be received within the next five years. Senior operations management approval has been obtained. After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity. Residual risk: We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both costs and disposal capacity will change, which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills or other sites that we (or a predecessor company) have delivered waste to. These liabilities are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for remediation activities and the related litigation costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the extent of contamination at each identified site, the most appropriate remedy, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Residual risks: Actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from estimates due to a number of uncertainties, such as the extent of contamination at a particular site, the final remedy, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties. Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs. An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense. 49 Table of Contents We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of remediation as necessary. As the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain, the liabilities are not discounted. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made. Summary: We have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 of approximately $189.6 million and $217.0 million, respectively, represents the most probable outcome of these matters. Cash paid for environmental matters during 2007 and 2006 was $21.0 million and $20.1 million, respectively. We do not expect that adjustments to estimates, which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts, will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity, financial position or results of operations. However, based on our review of the variability inherent in these estimates, we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate outcome of environmental matters, excluding capping, closure and post closure costs, could result in approximately $17.2 million of additional liability. Due to the nature of these matters, the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely occur over a period greater than five years. Self insurance Liabilities and Related Costs We maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation coverages, ranging from $1 million to $3 million. We determine our insurance claim liabilities primarily based upon our past claims experience, which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims. Our insurance claim liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We are the primary obligor for payment of all claims, therefore we report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis in other current and long term liabilities and any associated recoveries from our insurers in other assets. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately $284.1 million and $294.6 million of insurance claim liabilities and amounts due from insurers of $24.2 million and $34.5 million on our balance sheet. Cash paid for insurance claims during 2007 and 2006 was $239.3 million and $250.2 million, respectively. Residual risks: Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease. The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance liability to change. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liability. Managements assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. 50 Table of Contents Residual risks: Actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and result of operations in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs. Asset Impairment Valuation methodology. We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets. Residual risk: If events or changes in circumstances occur, including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings. Evaluation criteria. We test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Residual risk: Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than goodwill (see discussion below) relates to our landfills. A significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments or density changes could trigger an impairment charge. Recognition criteria. If such circumstances arise, we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset, if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. We generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value. Goodwill Recoverability Valuation methodology. We evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit. We define reporting units as our five geographic operating segments. We estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital, which was approximately 7.2% in 2007 and 7.5% in 2006. Residual risk: The estimated fair value of our reporting units could change with changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, actual capital expenditure levels, ability to perform at levels that were forecasted, or our market capitalization. For example, a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting units to below their carrying value, which would trigger an impairment charge. Similarly, an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge. 51 Table of Contents Evaluation criteria. We test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For example, a significant adverse change in our liquidity or the business environment, unanticipated competition, a significant adverse action by a regulator or the disposal of a significant portion of a reporting unit could prompt an impairment test between annual assessments. Recognition criteria. We recognize an impairment if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the related fair value. At the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a reporting unit, goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the reporting unit and a gain or loss on disposal is determined. Subsequently, the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment, which could result in an impairment charge. Residual risk: In the past, we have incurred non cash losses on sales of business units driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the business units divested. If similar divestitures are made in the future, we could incur additional non cash losses. Summary: At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had recorded goodwill of $8.0 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, all of which was considered to be recoverable from future operations based on estimated future discounted cash flow. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets, other than non deductible goodwill, and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (including net operating loss, capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards) when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future benefits giving rise to the deferred tax asset. We account for income tax uncertainties under FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which provides guidance on the recognition, derecognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. Residual risks: The balance sheet classification and amount of the income tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters. As these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting, future changes relating to these amounts will result in an adjustment to goodwill through December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, such adjustments will be charged or credited to earnings pursuant to SFAS 141(R), Business Combinations. Changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to income tax expense. We are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions. Positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge. Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken and benefited under FIN 48 are disallowed by the taxing authorities. 52 Table of Contents Summary: As of December 31, 2007, we have federal and state net operating loss, capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling $213 million most of which will expire if not used. Valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that certain of the state carryforwards may not be used. Also, as of December 31, 2007, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $528 million. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan, the BFI Retirement Plan (BFI Pension Plan), as a result of Allieds acquisition of BFI in 1999. The BFI Pension Plan covers certain employees in the United States, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The plans benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants were frozen upon acquisition. Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. No contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for 2008. The pension plans assets are invested as determined our Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2007, approximately 38% of the total plan assets of $400.0 million were invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately 62% in equity funds. We annually review and adjust the plans asset allocation as deemed necessary. Residual risk: Changes in the plans investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions. Assumptions. The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the pension plan are determined based on assumptions such as discount rate, expected rate of return and average rate of compensation increase. We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date. Where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. If the discount rate increases or decreases by 1%, our benefit obligation would decrease or increase by $33.0 million. In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate long term expected and historical actual returns on the plan assets, which give consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of our plan obligations. The average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3% of plan participants continue to earn service benefits. Our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary. Assumptions used to determine our defined benefit pension obligations are as follows (percent): 2007 2006 Discount rate 6.25 % 6.00 % Average rate of compensation increase 5.00 % 5.00 % 53 Table of Contents Assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost are as follows (percent): 2007 2006 2005 Discount rate 6.00 % 5.75 % 6.00 % Average rate of compensation increase 5.00 % 5.00 % 5.00 % Expected return on plan assets 8.25 % 8.50 % 8.50 % Residual risks: Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation. Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns. We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans in our balance sheet in accordance with the recognition provisions of SFAS No.158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). We will change our measurement date for the benefits obligations to our year end reporting date for the year ending December 31, 2008 in accordance with the measurement provisions of SFAS 158. We plan on utilizing the one measurement approach under which we measured our benefits obligations as of September 30, 2007 and will recognize the net benefit expense for the transition period from October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 in retained earnings as of December 31, 2008. New Accounting Standards For a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Form 10 K includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Forward Looking Statements).

Forward Looking Statements, although based on assumptions that we consider reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results, events or conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the Forward Looking Statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such Forward Looking Statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Examples of these Forward Looking Statements include, among others, statements regarding: our business and financial plans or strategies, and the projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies; our expectations regarding our capital expenditures for 2008; and our expected interest savings in connection with the refinancing of portions of our 2005 Credit Facility and the payment of our 8.50% senior notes with the proceeds of the issuance of our 6.875% senior notes due 2017. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward looking statements are: the general political and economic conditions in the United States, negative changes in which could (a) make it more difficult for us to predict economic trends, (b) cause a decline in the demand for our services (particularly in the commercial and industrial sectors), (c) cause a decline in the price of commodities sold by us or (d) increase competitive pressure on pricing; 54 Table of Contents the overall competitive nature of the waste management industry, which could cause pressure on pricing and the loss of business; our ability or inability to successfully identify and integrate acquired businesses and any liabilities associated with acquired businesses, which could impact our costs; our ability or inability to implement market development initiatives, pass on increased costs to customers, execute operational improvement plans and divest under performing assets, and to realize the anticipated benefits of these initiatives; our ability or inability to generate revenue growth and offset the impact of inflation and business growth on our costs through price increases, including the potential impact of price increases on volumes; changes in capital availability or costs, which, among other things, could affect our financial results due to our variable interest rate debt; severe weather conditions, which could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, reduced operational efficiency or disruptions to our operations; our ability to operate our business as we desire, which may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, our ability to obtain required permits on a timely basis (or at all), regulatory requirements and other factors; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, which could limit our ability to conduct or grow our business, increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures; changes in site remediation requirements or our estimates of the costs to comply with existing requirements, which could increase our costs, including costs for final capping, closure, post closure and other remediation obligations; the outcome of existing and any future legal proceedings, including any litigation, audit or investigation brought by or before any governmental body, which could result in increased costs or restrictions on our ability to operate; environmental liabilities in excess of our insurance, if any; increases in the costs in commodity, insurance, oil and fuel prices that make it more expensive to operate our business, including our ability or inability to reduce the impact of any such cost increases through cost reduction initiatives and other methods; workforce factors, including potential increases in our costs if we are required to provide additional funding to any multi employer pension plan to which we contribute and the negative impact on our operations of union organizing campaigns, work stoppages or labor shortages; the negative effect that trends toward requiring recycling, waste reduction at the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes could have on volumes of waste going to landfills and waste to energy facilities; changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting regulatory bodies to generally accepted accounting principles or policies; acts of war, riots or terrorism, including the events taking place in the Middle East, the current military action in Iraq and the continuing war on terrorism, as well as actions taken or to be taken by the United States or other governments as a result of further acts or threats of terrorism, and the impact of these acts on economic, financial and social conditions in the United States; and the timing and occurrence (or non occurrence) of transactions and events which may be subject to circumstances beyond our control. Other factors that could materially affect the Forward Looking Statements in this Form 10 K can be found in our risk factors detailed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the Forward Looking Statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such Forward Looking Statements. The Forward Looking Statements made herein are only made as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such Forward Looking Statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law. 55 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk. We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt. From time to time, to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2007. Increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact cash flow in 2007. At December 31, 2007, we have $1.3 billion of floating rate debt. If interest rates increases or decreases by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $13.3 million ($8.2 million after tax). This analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings. See Note 7, Long term Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk. Fuel prices. Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. Historically, we have mitigated fuel cost exposure with fixed price purchase contracts. These contracts expired in the first quarter of 2006. When economically practical, we may enter into new or renewal contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. Where appropriate, we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs. While we charge these fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers. Consequently, an increase in fuel costs results in (1) an increase in our costs of operations, (2) a smaller increase in our revenues (from the fuel recovery fee) and (3) a decrease in our operating margin percentage, since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost. Conversely, a decrease in fuel costs results in (1) a decrease in our costs of operations, (2) a smaller decrease in our revenues and (3) an increase in our operating margin percentage. At our current consumption levels, a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $1.1 million ($0.7 million, after tax) on an annual basis, which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenues and costs of operations. Commodities prices. We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities. As a result, changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations. Revenues from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in 2007 and 2006 were approximately $123 million and $91 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents
