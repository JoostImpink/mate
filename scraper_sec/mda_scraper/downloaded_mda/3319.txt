ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled Selected Financial Data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Section 1A of this report, entitled Risk Factors. Overview We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies for use in flat panel display, solid state lighting and other applications. Since 1994, we have been 27 Table of Contents exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials. Our revenues are generated through contract research, sales of development and commercial chemicals, technology development and evaluation agreements and license fees and royalties. In the future, we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream. While we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of OLED technologies (PHOLED, TOLED, FOLED, etc.) and materials, we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our OLED technologies and materials become more widely adopted by product manufacturers. We have incurred significant losses since our inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $145,356,626 as of December 31, 2006. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding: the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; the timing and volume of sales of our OLED materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes; the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities; and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees, valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation, as described below, are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. Revenue Recognition and Deferred License Fees Contract research revenue represents reimbursements by the U.S. government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts. Revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved. In order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period, we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved. Different estimates would result in different revenues for the period. We also receive non refundable advance license and royalty payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements. These payments are classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees, which represents the cash received and recorded as a liability until such time revenue can be recognized. Payments that are not creditable to a license are recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement. Payments that are creditable to a license are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party. If a license agreement is executed, these payments would be recorded as revenues over the expected life of the licensed technology; otherwise, they will be recorded as revenues at the time negotiations with the other party show that there is no appreciable likelihood of entering into a license agreement. If we used different estimates for the expected life of this licensed technology, reported revenue during the relevant period would differ. As of December 31, 2006, $10,894,768 was recorded as deferred revenue and deferred license fees. 28 Table of Contents A portion of our license and royalty revenue for 2004 was received from Aixtron AG based on OVPD equipment sold by Aixtron under our development and license agreement with them. This revenue was recognized upon our receipt of notification that the equipment was sold and an acknowledgement from Aixtron that royalties were due. Valuation of Acquired Technology We regularly review our acquired OLED technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies, particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use. As of December 31, 2006, we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for 2006, nor was such a revision needed in 2005 or 2004. If such a write down is required in the future, it could be for up to $6,319,488 the net book value of our acquired technology as of December 31, 2006. Valuation of Stock Based Compensation We account for our stock based compensation (see Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which addresses all forms of share based payment awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. It requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The statement eliminates the intrinsic value based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, that we used prior to 2006. We account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96 18 (EITF 96 18). SFAS No. 123R and EITF 96 18 require that we record an expense for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of making the disclosure required by SFAS No. 123R. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, assumptions are made for certain components of the model, including risk free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield rate and expected option life. Although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions, changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 We had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of $15,186,804 (or $0.49 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of $15,801,612 (or $0.56 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to: increased revenues of $1,773,297; and an increase in interest income of $749,075. The decrease in net loss was offset to some extent by an increase of $2,203,209 in operating expenses. Our revenues were $11,921,292 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $10,147,995 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in revenues was mainly due to: an increase in commercial chemical revenue of $1,844,676; an increase in royalty and license revenue of $2,166,624; and an increase in technology development revenue of $440,909. 29 Table of Contents The increase was offset by the following: a decrease in contract research revenue of $832,078; and a decrease in development chemical revenue of $1,846,834. We earned $3,821,903 in contract research revenue from the U.S. government in 2006, compared to $4,653,981 in 2005. The decrease was mainly attributable to the timing of revenue recognition under our government contracts. The number of government contracts we worked under and the level of effort performed under these contracts remained essentially constant from 2005 to 2006. We earned $1,656,851 from our sales of OLED materials for evaluation purposes in 2006, compared to $3,503,685 for corresponding sales in 2005. The decrease was mainly due to a customer that formerly purchased evaluation materials commencing the purchase of commercial materials instead. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such purchases from customers due to the early stage of the OLED industry. For 2006, our commercial chemical revenues and our royalty and license revenues were $1,876,071 and $2,400,179, respectively, compared to $31,395 and $233,555, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2005. The increase was due to purchases of our proprietary PHOLED materials for use in commercial OLED products by two new customers. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we began supplying one of our proprietary PHOLED materials to Samsung SDI for use in a commercial active matrix OLED display product. We cannot accurately predict how long these material sales will continue, as Samsung SDI is purchasing material from us on a purchase order basis. Continued sales of our PHOLED materials to Samsung SDI will depend on several factors, including, pricing, availability, continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings. For the first seven months of 2006, we also supplied one of our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics Corporation for use in a commercial active matrix OLED display product. Under this arrangement, we recognized both commercial chemical revenues and royalty and license revenue of $2,660,000 on account of our sales of these materials to AU Optronics. However, those sales ended when AU Optronics discontinued its manufacture of this display product, and we do not expect material sales to AU Optronics to resume in the foreseeable future. Commercial chemical revenues and royalty and license revenue from our sales of these materials to AU Optronics represented a substantial component of our revenues for 2006. Our royalty and license revenue for 2006 also included fees received under a patent license agreement executed with Samsung SDI in April 2005, and a cross license agreement executed with DuPont Displays, Inc. in December 2002. In connection with each of these agreements, we received upfront payments of license fees and of royalties, both of which have been classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees. The deferred license fees are being recognized as license fee revenue over the life of the agreement for Samsung SDI, and over 10 years for DuPont Displays. The deferred royalties in connection with the Samsung SDI agreement will be recognized as Samsung SDI commences sales of commercial OLED products and reports to us the royalties due on account of those sales. We expect to start receiving royalties based on Samsung SDIs sales of active matrix OLED display products in 2007. We recognized $2,166,288 in technology development revenue in 2006 in connection with technology development and evaluation agreements, compared to $1,725,379 for the same period in 2005. Although the number of contracts did not change, revenues increased due mainly to the timing of revenue recognition under a contract that commenced in the third quarter of 2005. The amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and evaluation services is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the OLED industry. We incurred research and development expenses of $19,864,944 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $19,183,390 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was mainly due to: an increase of $1,661,326 in personnel costs; and an increase of $1,464,059 attributable to increased operating costs associated with recent expansion of our New Jersey facility. 30 Table of Contents The increase was offset to some extent by the following: a refund by Princeton University for unspent research and development funds of $1,011,358; a decrease of $611,392 in amounts payable to PPG Industries due to the hiring of certain PPG employees as employees of ours; and a decrease of $563,203 in expenses related to the timing of recognition of the expense for stock issuances to non employee members of our Scientific Advisory Board. Included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of $513,487 and $97,353 for each of 2006 and 2005, respectively. These costs are associated with the Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) patent interference matter described in response to Item 3 of this report (Legal Proceedings). We anticipate that our patent defense costs may increase as active matrix OLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials enter the consumer marketplace. General and administrative expenses were $8,902,462 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $7,704,931 for the same period in 2005. The increase was due mainly to: an increase of $559,359 in costs relating to personnel due to salary increases and the recognition of stock based compensation under SFAS No. 123R; and an increase of $631,422 attributable to increased operating costs associated with our expanded facility. Royalty and license expenses were $687,436 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $610,098 for the same period in 2005. The increase was due to an increase accrual in royalties due to Princeton University of $67,338. Interest income increased to $2,168,933 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $1,419,858 for the year ended December 31, 2005. This was the result of higher rates of return on investments during 2006. During 2006, we sold approximately $7 million of our state related income tax net operating losses (NOLs) to New Jersey under the Technology Tax Certificate Transfer Program. In 2006, we received proceeds of $544,567 from the sale of these NOLs and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit. During 2005, we sold approximately $5 million of our state related income tax NOLs and received proceeds from these sales of $424,207. We expect to sell a similar quantity of NOLs in 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 We had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of $15,801,612 (or $0.56 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of $15,906,198 (or $0.59 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to: increased revenues of $3,141,082; and an increase in interest income of $624,238. The decrease in net loss was offset to some extent by an increase of $3,399,535 in operating expenses. Our revenues were $10,147,995 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $7,006,913 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in revenues was mainly due to: an increase in contract research revenue of $2,032,345; an increase in development chemical revenue of $1,019,615; and an increase in technology development revenue of $374,842. The increase was offset by the following: a decrease in commercial chemical revenue of $116,205; and a decrease in royalty and license revenue of $169,515. 31 Table of Contents We earned $4,653,981 in contract research revenue from the U.S. government in 2005, compared to $2,621,636 in 2004. The increase resulted mainly from our entering into several new government contracts during 2005. These contracts also involved additional prototyping work as compared to the more basic research we conducted under our government contracts in 2004. We earned $3,503,685 from our sales of OLED materials for evaluation purposes in 2005, compared to $2,484,070 for corresponding sales in 2004. The increase was mainly due to an increased volume of OLED materials purchased for evaluation by potential OLED display manufacturers, including our technology development and evaluation partners. For 2005, our commercial chemical revenues and our royalty and license revenues were $31,395 and $233,555, respectively, compared to $147,600 and $403,070, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2004. The decrease was due mainly to the timing of purchases of our proprietary PHOLED materials for use in a commercial OLED product by Tohoku Pioneer Corporation. All commercial chemical revenues in 2005 and 2004 were from this customer. Our royalty and license revenue for 2005 included fees received under our patent license agreement with Samsung SDI and our cross license agreement with DuPont Displays. Royalty and license revenue for 2004 also included $58,670 of royalty revenue from the sale of OVPD equipment by Aixtron AG, one of our licensees. Aixtron sold no such equipment in 2005. We recognized $1,725,379 in technology development revenue in 2005 in connection with technology development and evaluation agreements, compared to $1,350,537 for the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to new technology development and evaluation agreements entered into in 2005. We incurred research and development expenses of $19,183,390 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $16,651,335 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was mainly attributable to: an increase of $904,524 in our operating costs, associated in large part with the expansion of our New Jersey facility; an increase of $702,396 in charges in connection with our Development and License Agreement with PPG Industries (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an increase of $518,283 in expenses related to the timing of recognition of the expense for stock and option issuances to non employee members of our Scientific Advisory Board; and increased patent legal costs of $318,015. Included within research and development expenses are patent defense costs of $97,353 and $24,206 for each of 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs are associated with the SEL patent interference matter described in response to Item 3 of this report (Legal Proceedings). General and administrative expenses were $7,704,931 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $7,052,047 for the same period in 2004. The increase was due mainly to: an increase of $282,068 in personnel costs due to salary increases and increased healthcare costs; and an increase of $139,300 in expenses related to the timing of stock issuances to non employee members of our Board of Directors. Royalty expenses were $610,098 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $350,000 for the same period in 2004. The increase was mainly due to the minimum royalty requirement under our agreement with Motorola (Notes 5 and 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Under this agreement, we are required to make a minimum royalty payment at the end of the two year period ended December 31, 2006 of $1,000,000, as compared to a payment of $500,000 for the two year period ended December 31, 2004. Interest income increased to $1,419,858 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $795,620 for the prior year. This was mainly the result of increased cash balances throughout 2005, due to our March 2004 registered offering of common stock, together with higher rates of return on investments during 2005. 32 Table of Contents During 2005, we sold approximately $5 million of our state related income tax NOLs to New Jersey under the Technology Tax Certificate Transfer Program. In 2005, we received proceeds of $424,207 from the sale of these NOLs and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit. During 2004, we sold approximately $8 million of our state related income tax NOLs and received proceeds from these sales of $612,966. We recorded no deemed dividends for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $129,624 in deemed dividends recorded for the prior year. In 2004, we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and completed a registered offering of our common stock. These actions were deemed dilutive under the terms of a stock purchase warrant we had previously issued and resulted in the reduction of the exercise price of that warrant and an increase in the number of shares issuable under the warrant. We treated this occurrence as a deemed dividend of $46,176. In 2005, there were no actions deemed dilutive under the terms of this warrant. In 2004, the conversion price of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock we issued to Motorola, Inc. in September 2000 was adjusted in accordance with the Certificate of Designations for that stock. We accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature (CBCF). As a result, we recorded the CBCF as a deemed dividend in the amount of $83,448. There were no such deemed dividends in 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31,097,533, short term investments of $17,957,752 and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of $42,770, for a total of $49,098,055. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $30,654,249, short term investments of $17,190,242 and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of $1,828,708, for a total of $49,673,199, as of December 31, 2005. The small decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of $575,144 was primarily due to cash used in operating activities and purchases of equipment, offset to some extent by proceeds received from stock purchase warrant and stock option exercises. Cash used in operating activities was $4,703,792 for 2006, as compared to $345,059 for 2005. The increase was primarily due to changes in the following: increased recognition of deferred revenue and deferred license fees received in previous years; and the timing of billings to our customers and payments to our vendors during 2006 as compared to 2005. Cash used in investing activities was $1,134,692 for 2006, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $3,945,069 for 2005. The increase in cash used was due mainly to the partial use of proceeds from the sale of our investments for operating activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $6,281,769 for 2006, as compared to $8,123,658 for 2005. The cash provided by financing activities for both 2006 and 2005 consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase warrants and stock options. Working capital decreased to $37,422,740 as of December 31, 2006, from working capital of $38,347,913 as of December 31, 2005. The reduction was primarily due to an increase in current liabilities relating to the classification of deferred license fees as current liabilities. In 2006, we received $3,700,000 in non refundable payments under our development and technology evaluation agreements that are creditable against license fees under a license agreement, if executed. Therefore, we classify these advanced payments as current deferred license fees until a license agreement is executed or until there is no appreciable likelihood of entering into a license agreement. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance and defense of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations through at least 2008. 33 Table of Contents We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options. We have an effective shelf registration statement that would enable us to offer, from time to time, up to $44,725,524 of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities, subject to market conditions and other factors. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that this additional funding will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2006, we had the following contractual commitments: Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long term debt $ $ $ $ $ Operating lease obligations 4,000 4,000 Capital lease obligations Purchase obligations Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP Other Obligations: Sponsored research obligation 4,504,439 2,398,260 2,106,179 Minimum royalty obligation 600,000 100,000 300,000 200,000 $ 100,000/year(1 ) Total(2) $ 5,108,439 $ 2,502,260 $ 2,406,179 $ 200,000 $ 100,000/year(1 ) (1) Under our Amended License Agreement with Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan, we are obligated to pay minimum royalties of $100,000 per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect. (2) See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the Company. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not expect that the adoption of these recently accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk. Our 34 Table of Contents primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments.
