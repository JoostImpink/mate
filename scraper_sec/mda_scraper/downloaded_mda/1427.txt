We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements for such factors. Overview Pyramid Breweries Inc. is engaged in the brewing, marketing and selling of craft beers under the Pyramid and MacTarnahans labels. Until the end of 2006, we also produced a line of gourmet sodas under the Thomas Kemper Soda Company label, which we subsequently sold in January 2007 as more fully discussed below. We operate two alehouse restaurants adjacent to our full production breweries under the Pyramid Alehouse and MacTarnahan Taproom brand names in Berkeley, California and Portland, Oregon, respectively, and three alehouse restaurants located in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California and Seattle, Washington. As of December 31, 2006, our products were distributed in approximately 38 states within the U.S. through a network of selected independent distributors and brokers. Our revenues consist primarily of sales of beer and soda to third party distributors who distribute to independent retailers and retail sales of beer, soda, food, apparel and other items in our alehouse restaurants. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively, approximately 70%, 68% and 65% of our net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors, while total retail alehouse sales accounted for 30%, 32% and 35%, respectively. We sell our craft beers in bottles and kegs. Although bottled products normally sell for a higher per barrel selling price, gross margin on our draft products are typically higher as a percentage compared to bottled products. Changes in the proportion of sales of bottled and draft products therefore will affect our gross margin. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 60%, 60% and 57%, respectively, of our sales of craft beers were bottled products. On July 31, 2004, we completed our purchase of certain Portland Brewing Company (Portland Brewing) assets which included assets of the brewery and alehouse for total consideration, including transaction costs, of approximately $4.5 million, consisting of a combination of assumed liabilities, cash and 445,434 shares of Pyramid common stock valued at $3.26 per share. At the time of the acquisition, we entered into a contract brewing arrangement and other commercial arrangements with Portland Brewing whereby we subleased to Portland Brewing the premises on which the Portland Brewery is located and leased to Portland Brewing certain brewery equipment, engaged Portland Brewing to produce certain Company branded beers on those premises, provided employees to Portland Brewing for Portland Brewings use in brewery operations, subleased to Portland Brewing 19 Table of Contents the premises on which the MacTarnahans Taproom is located, and provided staffing and on site management of the alehouse. During the second quarter of 2005, we consolidated brewery operations by moving all Seattle production to the Portland Brewery operated by Portland Brewing in an effort to reduce production costs and streamline production and distribution. Subsequently, in August 2005, we sold substantially all equipment located in the Seattle, Washington brewing facility, resulting in a reported gain of approximately $415,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Seattle Alehouse restaurant continues to produce beer locally in its small, on site brewery. During 2006, the TTB concluded its audit of certain federal excise tax returns and related operations of the Company and the TTBs findings were presented to us. Among other things, the TTB reviewed our contract brewing arrangement with Portland Brewing. At the conclusion of the audit, the TTB asserted that we, not Portland Brewing, had legal control of the Portland brewery facility for purposes of the federal excise tax laws and consequently had underpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at that facility during the period January 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006. The TTB also concluded that since Portland Brewing was not the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility, it had overpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at the facility. Based on its findings in the audit, the TTB issued us a notice of proposed assessment asserting that we owed a total of approximately $2.1 million in excise taxes and interest for that period, which did not take into account the approximately $1 million in excise taxes paid by Portland Brewing on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility during the same period. After receiving the notice of proposed assessment, we engaged in discussions with the TTB relating to a possible compromise of the assessment and also voluntarily began to pay federal excise taxes on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at that facility (i.e., at a higher average rate per barrel). As a result of our discussions with the TTB, we reached an agreement with the TTB that we will pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by Portland Brewing for the period at issue, due to Portland Brewings waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an initial payment of $50,000, with the remaining balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at a variable interest rate estimated at 8%. In September 2006, based on our discussions with the TTB and Portland Brewing, we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with Portland Brewing to comply with the TTBs interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that Portland Brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility. Consequently, we elected to terminate the contract brewing and other commercial arrangements with Portland Brewing. In the fourth quarter 2006, after the receipt of all state and federal authorizations required, we formally assumed all brewery and alehouse operations at our brewery and alehouse facilities in Portland, Oregon. On January 2, 2007, we completed the sale of the Thomas Kemper Soda brand and related net assets and liabilities (TK Soda Assets) to The Kemper Company, a new company formed by Adventure Funds, a Portland based equity investment fund. Under terms of the transactions, we received $3.1 million for Thomas Kemper Soda assets including the brand and intellectual property, soda kegs, vehicles and point of sale materials. The transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which we will continue to manufacture Thomas Kemper Soda products for Kemper at its breweries in Portland, Oregon and Berkeley, California. Through this transaction, we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year. This includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth, and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross Sales. Gross sales increased 6.8%, or $3.4 million, to $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $50.9 million in 2005. Wholesale beverage segment sales increased 10.5%, or $3.7 million, to $39.3 million as a result of a 5.7% increase in total beverage shipments to 243,000 barrels as well as an average price increase of 5% for beer. Of the total beverage shipments, beer shipments increased by 7.0% to 198,000 barrels in 2006 from 185,000 barrels in 2005, primarily due to increased Pyramid brand shipments. Pyramid brand shipments increased 18.0% to 164,000 barrels for the year, driven by Pyramid Hefe Weizen, our top selling product, which was 20 Table of Contents up 16.7% in shipment volumes for the year. The increase in Pyramid brand shipments was offset by declines in other non core beer brand shipments, which were down 27.3% to 24,000 barrels due primarily to the discontinuation of certain product styles in the MacTarnahans and non core beer brands. Thomas Kemper Soda shipments were flat in 2006, at 45,000 barrels, as compared to barrels shipped during 2005. Alehouse sales of $15.1 million decreased 1.9% over a year ago, primarily due a decline in sales in the Portland MacTarnahans Taproom primarily due to reduced traffic resulting from inclement weather in the second and fourth quarters offset by single digit sales growth in our Walnut Creek location. Excise Taxes. Excise taxes were 10.1% and 7.1% of gross beverage sales for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in 2006 increased to $21.00 per beer barrel as compared to $14.30 for the same period in 2005. Federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments. For the first 60,000 barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like Pyramid is $7 per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an $18 per beer barrel rate. State taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis. The increase in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales is related primarily to the agreement reached with the TTB during the third quarter of 2006 (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) in which we agreed to pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the Portland Brewing Company for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Also contributing to the increase in excise taxes, we began paying federal excise taxes on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at the facility at the $18 per barrel rate. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased 12.0% to $11.6 million in 2006 from $10.4 million in 2005, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment at more favorable prices, offset by the one time impact of the $700,000 TTB excise tax assessment recorded in 2006, the effect of which was moderated by the fact that gross margin in 2005 benefited from a $415,000 gain on the sale of brewery equipment relating to the consolidation of production operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 21.4% in 2005. The following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): % of % of Segment Segment Gross Margin 2006 Net Sales 2005 Net Sales $ Change % Change Beverage Segment $ 10,843 30.7 % $ 9,911 30.0 % $ 932 9.4 % Alehouse Segment 752 5.0 % 446 2.9 % 306 68.6 % Total $ 11,595 23.0 % $ 10,357 21.4 % $ 1,238 12.0 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14.1%, or $1.6 million, to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $11.4 million in 2005. The additional expense was primarily attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million, to $5.4 million, due primarily to executive transition costs of approximately $432,000, increases in professional fees of $414,000 related primarily to legal fees associated with the TTB excise tax audit, rent expense associated with the vacant Seattle brewery of approximately $351,000, an increase in director and public company costs of $166,000, associated primarily with our compliance efforts with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and increased consulting fees of $206,000. Additionally, selling expenses for 2006 increased by $414,000 and totaled $5.6 million, or 15.7% of net beverage segment sales, compared to $5.1 million, or 15.6% of net beverage segment sales in 2005. Marketing expense decreased $400,000 to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $2.4 million in 2005 primarily due to decreases in package redesign costs as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits as a result of lower headcount. Other Expense, net. Other expense, net, increased to $190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $45,000 in 2005, primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with our capital lease agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). 21 Table of Contents Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2006, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. Net Loss. We reported a net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in 2005. The net loss in 2005 was positively impacted by the one time gain on the sale of brewery equipment of $415,000 relating to the consolidation of production operations in the third quarter of 2005. Aside from that factor, the increase in net loss of $506,000 is primarily due to the TTB excise tax settlement during the third quarter of 2006 and an increase in general and administrative expenses, offset by the incremental sales due to the beverage sales volume and price increases. Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Gross Sales. Gross sales increased 20.7%, or $8.7 million, to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $42.2 million in 2004. Wholesale beverage segment sales increased 26.1%, or $7.4 million, to $35.5 million as a result of a 25.7% increase in total beverage shipments to 230,000 barrels. Strong craft beer category sales in key West Coast markets contributed to increases in beer shipments of 30.3% over the prior year. Pyramid brands accounted for 14.9% of this increase with beer shipments of 139,000 barrels in 2005, compared to 121,100 barrels in 2004. Thomas Kemper Soda shipments increased 9.8% across all flavors in 2005, to 45,000 barrels, as compared to 41,000 barrels shipped during 2004. Also contributing to the growth in sales was a full year of sales from the MacTarnahans Brand Family, acquired in the 2004 asset purchase agreement with Portland Brewing. Alehouse sales of $15.4 million improved 9.7% over a year ago primarily due to a full year of sales in 2005 for the MacTarnahans Taproom, acquired in the 2004 asset purchase agreement with Portland Brewing. Excise Taxes. Excise taxes were 7.1% and 7.4% of gross beverage sales for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in 2005 decreased to $14.30 per barrel as compared to $15.49 for the same period in 2004. Federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments. For the first 60,000 barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like Pyramid is $7 per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an $18 per beer barrel rate. State taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis. The decrease in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales in 2005 is related to a greater portion of beverage sales to states with lower excise taxes and in which distributors pay the excise tax as well as contract brewing arrangements in which we incur lower costs. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased 42.2% to $10.4 million in 2005 from $7.3 million in 2004. The gross margin increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment and a corresponding decrease in per barrel costs, and a $415,000 gain on the sale of brewery equipment from consolidation of production operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 18.2% in 2004. The following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): % of % of Segment Segment Gross Margin 2005 Net Sales 2004 Net Sales $ Change % Change Beverage Segment $ 9,911 30.0 % $ 6,843 26.2 % $ 3,068 44.8 % Alehouse Segment 446 2.9 % 438 3.1 % 8 1.8 % Total $ 10,357 21.4 % $ 7,281 18.2 % $ 3,076 42.2 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.1%, or $1.3 million, to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $10.1 million in 2004. The additional expense was primarily attributed to a $1.0 million increase in selling and marketing expense for package redesign work released in the third quarter and an increase in the size of our sales force to support efforts to 22 Table of Contents grow the Pyramid brands. Selling and marketing expenses for the period ended December 31, 2005 totaled $5.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, or 15.6% and 7.3% of net beverage sales, respectively, in comparison to $4.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, or 17.1% or 8.2%, respectively for 2004. General and administrative expenses for the period ended December 31, 2005 were $3.8 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2004, primarily due to bonuses, executive stock based compensation, and professional and director fees. Other Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased to expense of $45,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from income of $44,000 in 2004, primarily due to an increase in interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $520,000 in comparison to $224,000 for 2004, largely due to the interest associated with the Berkeley facility mortgage and the interest on borrowings under our line of credit, partially offset by sublease income of $217,000. Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2005, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. Net Loss. We reported a net loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in 2004. The decrease in net loss of $1.6 million was primarily due to the $415,000 gain realized on the sale of excess production equipment from the Seattle brewery facility, as well as beverage sales volume increases, and the cost reduction initiatives relating to consolidating production operations, partially offset by increased freight costs and additional sales and marketing activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had a $227,000 balance of cash and cash equivalents and a $3.1 million accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, our working capital was negative at $1.4 million compared to a negative $972,000 at December 31, 2005. Our working capital was impacted negatively by executive transition costs, the excise tax settlement discussed below, as well as an increase in short term financing related to our capital lease keg financing agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $1.1 million from $1.3 million in 2005. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss of $506,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $891,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $198,000 in 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflect the fact that we sold brewery equipment assets in 2005 which generated $783,000 in cash. Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $364,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately $646,000 for 2005. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year was primarily due to payment to the TTB in connection with the excise tax settlement, no net payments or borrowings on the line of credit as of December 31, 2006 compared to $400,000 in cash paid in the prior year as well as a decrease of cash dividends paid. In March 2007, we renegotiated our line of credit agreement with First Mutual Bank which makes available through March 31, 2008, a $2.5 million line of credit. A portion of the line of credit, $345,000, has been reserved to support the standby letter of credit for the keg lease agreement (Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Any borrowings are subject to an interest rate of prime plus 0.5%, fully floating, with a 0.8% commitment fee. Under the terms of the agreement, we must limit capital expenditures to $3.25 million and adhere to certain financial performance covenants with a restriction on the payment of future dividends. The beverage segment operates with relatively short accounts receivable terms and the alehouse segment operates essentially as a cash business, as such we typically tend to collect within 30 days of a sale or immediately upon sale. Therefore, we generally do not require significant cash on hand to meet operating needs. 23 Table of Contents We settled with the TTB in 2006 (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) and agreed to pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the Portland Brewing Company for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an initial payment of $50,000, and the remaining balance will be payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at a variable interest rate estimated at 8%. In January 2007, we completed the sale of the TK Soda Assets to The Kemper Company, a new company formed by Adventure Funds, a Portland based equity investment fund. Under terms of the transaction, we received $2.8 million in cash for TK Soda Assets including the brand and intellectual property, soda kegs, vehicles and point of sale materials. The transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which Pyramid will continue to manufacture Thomas Kemper Soda products for The Kemper Company at its breweries in Portland, Oregon and Berkeley, California. Through this transaction, we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year. This includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth, and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies in our breweries to reduce costs and improve margins. We believe that our cash flow from operating activities, tighter management of capital spending and cash management in combination with various financing options, including the line of credit and capital asset leasing, should provide adequate working capital to meet our needs. Additionally, we believe that the cash provided from the sale of the TK Soda Assets will improve our liquidity by reducing our reliance on our line of credit during the seasonally slow first quarter of 2007, while allowing us to make these capital investments. However, it is possible that this cash infusion may be insufficient to meet our capital investment requirements, which would require us to seek additional capital from other sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2006, our commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows (in thousands): Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Operating leases(1) $ 5,013 $ 1,226 $ 1,955 $ 1,257 $ 575 Capital leases(2) 890 385 505 Note payable(3) 7,671 105 228 257 7,081 TTB excise tax assessment(4) 634 201 433 $ 14,208 $ 1,917 $ 3,121 $ 1,514 $ 7,656 (1) We have obligations in the form of revenue sharing provisions in certain alehouse lease agreements, based on the excess of the percentage of revenue over the minimum lease payment. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts owed under revenue sharing agreements. (2) In 2006, we acquired 14,500 of new kegs under our capital lease agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) for a total of $1.2 million, payable over a 30 month period. (3) The amounts are principal only payments as stated in securitized financing arrangement for the Berkeley Facility purchase. (4) In 2006, we settled with the TTB, resolving all issues arising from the audit including the federal tax assessments for the period at issue (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) for a total amount of $700,000, payable in monthly installments for a period of three years. In conjunction with the Portland Brewing asset purchase, we entered into a five year earn out agreement with Portland Brewing Company which may result in additional payments to Portland Brewing based on sales of Portland Brewing brands during the earn out period through December 31, 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts owed under the earn out. 24 Table of Contents Contingencies We concluded discussions with the TTB relating to the TTBs findings from its recently completed audit of the federal excise tax returns and operations of the Company. Upon completion of the audit the TTB had concluded that (a) notwithstanding our contractual arrangements with Portland Brewing relating to the production of beer at our Portland, Oregon brewery facility, we not Portland Brewing were the legal brewer at that facility and (b) that federal excise taxes on beer production at the Portland facility from January 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 had been underpaid. These contractual arrangements were originally premised on the understanding that they would result in Portland Brewing being deemed the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility, which would have resulted in lower federal excise tax costs on beer produced at that facility because Portland Brewing is a small brewer that pays excise taxes at a lower rate on the first 60,000 barrels it produces. After we were notified of the TTBs conclusions from the audit, we engaged in discussions with the TTB regarding a compromise of the TTBs proposed assessment relating to our underpayment of excise taxes and explored with the TTB whether our commercial relationship with Portland Brewing could be modified so that in the future we met the TTBs requirements for a valid contract brewing arrangement. As a result of our discussions with the TTB, we reached a settlement with the TTB that we would pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by Portland Brewing for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments (the Settlement). Under the terms of the Settlement, we were obligated to make an initial payment of $50,000, with the balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at an interest rate that is currently estimated to be approximately 8%. We recognized the $700,000 Settlement as a charge to earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. We anticipate that our current operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy the payment terms described above. In addition, based on our discussions with the TTB, we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with Portland Brewing to comply with the TTBs interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that Portland Brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility. Consequently, we elected to terminate the Production Agreement dated February 14, 2006 as amended July 31, 2006 between us and Portland Brewing (the Production Agreement) by written notice to Portland Brewing dated September 28, 2006. The termination of the Production Agreement was effective on November 30, 2006. In addition to the Production Agreement, certain related agreements between us and Portland Brewing will terminate per their respective terms when the Production Agreement terminates. In June 2005, Sound Beverages, a former distributor of ours, filed a suit in King County Superior Court against us. The suit alleged that we had violated Washingtons Wholesale Distributor/Supplier Equity Act, RCW 19.126, by unreasonably withholding consent to the transfer of distribution rights to Columbia Distribution. We contend that we were within our rights to reasonably withhold consent, and are contesting this matter including the $450,000 in damages claimed by Sound Beverages. This matter is in the early stages of arbitration. Management believes that the ultimate outcome to us will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the matter discussed above, we are involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any such claims, proceedings or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies To prepare financial statements that conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP), management must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our accounting estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 25 Table of Contents readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following: Inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first in, first out basis and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value. We regularly review our inventories for the presence of excess and obsolete inventory using criteria such as age, quality, seasonal demand forecasts and branding changes, and write off or adjust the inventory to carrying value. Long Lived Assets Impairment. We review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. Long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less the estimated costs to sell. Long lived assets are written down to their estimated net fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis in the event of an impairment. If circumstances related to our long lived assets change, our valuation of the long lived assets could materially change. Goodwill Impairment. We review our goodwill, which relates entirely to our previous acquisition of Thomas Kemper Soda, annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances occur. Goodwill was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2006, pending the sale of the Thomas Kemper Soda Brand, which occurred in January 2007. Allowance for Keg Deposits. We purchase kegs from vendors and record these assets in property, plant and equipment. When the kegs are shipped to the distributors, a keg deposit is collected based on, among other things, the size of the keg and the destination point and is refunded to the distributors upon return of the kegs to us. The keg deposit liability is recorded as a current liability. On a periodic basis, typically annually, management is required to make certain estimates regarding the physical count of kegs in the marketplace, estimated loss of kegs, expectations regarding keg returns and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of keg deposit liabilities and keg assets in property, plant and equipment at the date of the financial statements. Actual keg deposit liability could differ from the estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized at the time of shipment, when the title of our products passes to the customer in accordance with distributor sales agreements and collectibility is probable. We do not have standard terms that permit return of product. The cost for product returns are recorded in cost of sales and revenue is reduced at the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is returned. Beverage segment revenues under the commercial arrangements with the Portland Brewing Company were recorded on a gross basis pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent as it was a principal in accordance with the indicators which include the following: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) having latitude in establishing price; (iii) having discretion in supplier selection; (iv) determination of product or service specifications; and (v) having credit risk. Stock based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes option pricing method, which requires the input 26 Table of Contents of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures) and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the options for only the portion of options expected to vest. Therefore, we applied an estimated forfeiture rate that we derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from our estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. Additionally, the risk free interest rate used in the Black Scholes valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available in U.S. Treasury securities at maturity with an equivalent term. We have not provided for a dividend assumption in the Black Scholes valuation method for grants beginning in 2005 as we ceased paying any dividends in early 2005 and currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the future. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently, the related expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Realization of Deferred Tax Assets. We evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is based on existing deferred tax liabilities and an assessment of our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to the extent that recovery is not likely. If circumstances related to our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income change, our evaluation of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could materially change. Promotional Activities. Throughout the year, our sales force engages in promotional activities with our distributor and retail customers. In connection with financial statement preparation and other financial reporting, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures resulting from these activities. Actual expenditures incurred could differ from managements estimates and assumptions. If managements estimates and assumptions differ from the actual promotional activities incurred a timing difference could result either understating or overstating the actual promotional activity expense in a subsequent period. Because of the nature of promotional activities and the historical trends used in management analysis, management does not consider the potential timing differences to be a significant risk in the financial statement presentation. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment (Revised 2004), which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the fair value of all employee share based payments, including grants of employee stock options as well as compensatory employee stock purchase plans. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 which expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations. In April 2005, the SEC issued a press release that amends the required adoption date of SFAS No. 123R as no later than the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which was effective for our quarterly results as of and for the period ended March 31, 2006. We adopted the modified prospective transition method. During 2006, we recorded $321,000 of stock based compensation expenses including $69,000 stock based compensation associated with implementing SFAS No. 123(R). In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation), which states that a company may adopt a policy for presenting taxes on a gross or net basis. If taxes are significant, the accounting policy should be disclosed, and if taxes are presented gross, the amounts included in revenue should be disclosed. The consensus reached on this Issue is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2006 with early application permitted. As our accounting policy is to present excise taxes on a gross basis as described in the EITF 06 3, our policy and disclosure presentation are already in accordance with EITF No. 06 3. 27 Table of Contents In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions including whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The impact of adopting FIN No. 48 will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement (rollover) approach and a balance sheet (iron curtain) approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. We adopted SAB 108 effective January 1, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased beginning accumulated deficit by $258,000, and increased deferred rent by $174,000 (Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. The Statement permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements in order to facilitate comparisons between entities choosing different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 does not affect existing accounting requirements for certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value. This statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the impact on the financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We currently do not hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities, nor have we engaged in such activities in the past. Also, we did not have any outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2006 due to the fact that we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit. Further, we do not enter into significant transactions denominated in foreign currency. Accordingly, our direct exposure to risks arising from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments is not material. 28 Table of Contents

Overview Pyramid Breweries Inc. is engaged in the brewing, marketing and selling of craft beers under the Pyramid and MacTarnahans labels. Until the end of 2006, we also produced a line of gourmet sodas under the Thomas Kemper Soda Company label, which we subsequently sold in January 2007 as more fully discussed below. We operate two alehouse restaurants adjacent to our full production breweries under the Pyramid Alehouse and MacTarnahan Taproom brand names in Berkeley, California and Portland, Oregon, respectively, and three alehouse restaurants located in Walnut Creek and Sacramento, California and Seattle, Washington. As of December 31, 2006, our products were distributed in approximately 38 states within the U.S. through a network of selected independent distributors and brokers. Our revenues consist primarily of sales of beer and soda to third party distributors who distribute to independent retailers and retail sales of beer, soda, food, apparel and other items in our alehouse restaurants. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively, approximately 70%, 68% and 65% of our net sales were sales of beer and soda to third party distributors, while total retail alehouse sales accounted for 30%, 32% and 35%, respectively. We sell our craft beers in bottles and kegs. Although bottled products normally sell for a higher per barrel selling price, gross margin on our draft products are typically higher as a percentage compared to bottled products. Changes in the proportion of sales of bottled and draft products therefore will affect our gross margin. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 60%, 60% and 57%, respectively, of our sales of craft beers were bottled products. On July 31, 2004, we completed our purchase of certain Portland Brewing Company (Portland Brewing) assets which included assets of the brewery and alehouse for total consideration, including transaction costs, of approximately $4.5 million, consisting of a combination of assumed liabilities, cash and 445,434 shares of Pyramid common stock valued at $3.26 per share. At the time of the acquisition, we entered into a contract brewing arrangement and other commercial arrangements with Portland Brewing whereby we subleased to Portland Brewing the premises on which the Portland Brewery is located and leased to Portland Brewing certain brewery equipment, engaged Portland Brewing to produce certain Company branded beers on those premises, provided employees to Portland Brewing for Portland Brewings use in brewery operations, subleased to Portland Brewing 19 Table of Contents the premises on which the MacTarnahans Taproom is located, and provided staffing and on site management of the alehouse. During the second quarter of 2005, we consolidated brewery operations by moving all Seattle production to the Portland Brewery operated by Portland Brewing in an effort to reduce production costs and streamline production and distribution. Subsequently, in August 2005, we sold substantially all equipment located in the Seattle, Washington brewing facility, resulting in a reported gain of approximately $415,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Seattle Alehouse restaurant continues to produce beer locally in its small, on site brewery. During 2006, the TTB concluded its audit of certain federal excise tax returns and related operations of the Company and the TTBs findings were presented to us. Among other things, the TTB reviewed our contract brewing arrangement with Portland Brewing. At the conclusion of the audit, the TTB asserted that we, not Portland Brewing, had legal control of the Portland brewery facility for purposes of the federal excise tax laws and consequently had underpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at that facility during the period January 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006. The TTB also concluded that since Portland Brewing was not the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility, it had overpaid federal excise taxes on beer produced at the facility. Based on its findings in the audit, the TTB issued us a notice of proposed assessment asserting that we owed a total of approximately $2.1 million in excise taxes and interest for that period, which did not take into account the approximately $1 million in excise taxes paid by Portland Brewing on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility during the same period. After receiving the notice of proposed assessment, we engaged in discussions with the TTB relating to a possible compromise of the assessment and also voluntarily began to pay federal excise taxes on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at that facility (i.e., at a higher average rate per barrel). As a result of our discussions with the TTB, we reached an agreement with the TTB that we will pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by Portland Brewing for the period at issue, due to Portland Brewings waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an initial payment of $50,000, with the remaining balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at a variable interest rate estimated at 8%. In September 2006, based on our discussions with the TTB and Portland Brewing, we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with Portland Brewing to comply with the TTBs interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that Portland Brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility. Consequently, we elected to terminate the contract brewing and other commercial arrangements with Portland Brewing. In the fourth quarter 2006, after the receipt of all state and federal authorizations required, we formally assumed all brewery and alehouse operations at our brewery and alehouse facilities in Portland, Oregon. On January 2, 2007, we completed the sale of the Thomas Kemper Soda brand and related net assets and liabilities (TK Soda Assets) to The Kemper Company, a new company formed by Adventure Funds, a Portland based equity investment fund. Under terms of the transactions, we received $3.1 million for Thomas Kemper Soda assets including the brand and intellectual property, soda kegs, vehicles and point of sale materials. The transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which we will continue to manufacture Thomas Kemper Soda products for Kemper at its breweries in Portland, Oregon and Berkeley, California. Through this transaction, we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year. This includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth, and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Gross Sales. Gross sales increased 6.8%, or $3.4 million, to $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $50.9 million in 2005. Wholesale beverage segment sales increased 10.5%, or $3.7 million, to $39.3 million as a result of a 5.7% increase in total beverage shipments to 243,000 barrels as well as an average price increase of 5% for beer. Of the total beverage shipments, beer shipments increased by 7.0% to 198,000 barrels in 2006 from 185,000 barrels in 2005, primarily due to increased Pyramid brand shipments. Pyramid brand shipments increased 18.0% to 164,000 barrels for the year, driven by Pyramid Hefe Weizen, our top selling product, which was 20 Table of Contents up 16.7% in shipment volumes for the year. The increase in Pyramid brand shipments was offset by declines in other non core beer brand shipments, which were down 27.3% to 24,000 barrels due primarily to the discontinuation of certain product styles in the MacTarnahans and non core beer brands. Thomas Kemper Soda shipments were flat in 2006, at 45,000 barrels, as compared to barrels shipped during 2005. Alehouse sales of $15.1 million decreased 1.9% over a year ago, primarily due a decline in sales in the Portland MacTarnahans Taproom primarily due to reduced traffic resulting from inclement weather in the second and fourth quarters offset by single digit sales growth in our Walnut Creek location. Excise Taxes. Excise taxes were 10.1% and 7.1% of gross beverage sales for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in 2006 increased to $21.00 per beer barrel as compared to $14.30 for the same period in 2005. Federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments. For the first 60,000 barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like Pyramid is $7 per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an $18 per beer barrel rate. State taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis. The increase in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales is related primarily to the agreement reached with the TTB during the third quarter of 2006 (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) in which we agreed to pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the Portland Brewing Company for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Also contributing to the increase in excise taxes, we began paying federal excise taxes on beer produced at the Portland brewery facility as if we were the legal brewer at the facility at the $18 per barrel rate. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased 12.0% to $11.6 million in 2006 from $10.4 million in 2005, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment at more favorable prices, offset by the one time impact of the $700,000 TTB excise tax assessment recorded in 2006, the effect of which was moderated by the fact that gross margin in 2005 benefited from a $415,000 gain on the sale of brewery equipment relating to the consolidation of production operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 21.4% in 2005. The following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): % of % of Segment Segment Gross Margin 2006 Net Sales 2005 Net Sales $ Change % Change Beverage Segment $ 10,843 30.7 % $ 9,911 30.0 % $ 932 9.4 % Alehouse Segment 752 5.0 % 446 2.9 % 306 68.6 % Total $ 11,595 23.0 % $ 10,357 21.4 % $ 1,238 12.0 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14.1%, or $1.6 million, to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $11.4 million in 2005. The additional expense was primarily attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million, to $5.4 million, due primarily to executive transition costs of approximately $432,000, increases in professional fees of $414,000 related primarily to legal fees associated with the TTB excise tax audit, rent expense associated with the vacant Seattle brewery of approximately $351,000, an increase in director and public company costs of $166,000, associated primarily with our compliance efforts with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and increased consulting fees of $206,000. Additionally, selling expenses for 2006 increased by $414,000 and totaled $5.6 million, or 15.7% of net beverage segment sales, compared to $5.1 million, or 15.6% of net beverage segment sales in 2005. Marketing expense decreased $400,000 to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $2.4 million in 2005 primarily due to decreases in package redesign costs as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits as a result of lower headcount. Other Expense, net. Other expense, net, increased to $190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, from $45,000 in 2005, primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with our capital lease agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). 21 Table of Contents Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2006, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. Net Loss. We reported a net loss of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in 2005. The net loss in 2005 was positively impacted by the one time gain on the sale of brewery equipment of $415,000 relating to the consolidation of production operations in the third quarter of 2005. Aside from that factor, the increase in net loss of $506,000 is primarily due to the TTB excise tax settlement during the third quarter of 2006 and an increase in general and administrative expenses, offset by the incremental sales due to the beverage sales volume and price increases. Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Gross Sales. Gross sales increased 20.7%, or $8.7 million, to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $42.2 million in 2004. Wholesale beverage segment sales increased 26.1%, or $7.4 million, to $35.5 million as a result of a 25.7% increase in total beverage shipments to 230,000 barrels. Strong craft beer category sales in key West Coast markets contributed to increases in beer shipments of 30.3% over the prior year. Pyramid brands accounted for 14.9% of this increase with beer shipments of 139,000 barrels in 2005, compared to 121,100 barrels in 2004. Thomas Kemper Soda shipments increased 9.8% across all flavors in 2005, to 45,000 barrels, as compared to 41,000 barrels shipped during 2004. Also contributing to the growth in sales was a full year of sales from the MacTarnahans Brand Family, acquired in the 2004 asset purchase agreement with Portland Brewing. Alehouse sales of $15.4 million improved 9.7% over a year ago primarily due to a full year of sales in 2005 for the MacTarnahans Taproom, acquired in the 2004 asset purchase agreement with Portland Brewing. Excise Taxes. Excise taxes were 7.1% and 7.4% of gross beverage sales for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Per beer barrel shipped excise taxes in 2005 decreased to $14.30 per barrel as compared to $15.49 for the same period in 2004. Federal taxes paid on beer shipments are determined by the level of shipments. For the first 60,000 barrels of production the federal excise tax rate for small brewers like Pyramid is $7 per barrel resulting in incremental volume being taxed at an $18 per beer barrel rate. State taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis. The decrease in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales in 2005 is related to a greater portion of beverage sales to states with lower excise taxes and in which distributors pay the excise tax as well as contract brewing arrangements in which we incur lower costs. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased 42.2% to $10.4 million in 2005 from $7.3 million in 2004. The gross margin increased primarily as a result of higher sales volumes in the beverage segment and a corresponding decrease in per barrel costs, and a $415,000 gain on the sale of brewery equipment from consolidation of production operations. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 18.2% in 2004. The following table represents the gross margin comparisons and changes by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): % of % of Segment Segment Gross Margin 2005 Net Sales 2004 Net Sales $ Change % Change Beverage Segment $ 9,911 30.0 % $ 6,843 26.2 % $ 3,068 44.8 % Alehouse Segment 446 2.9 % 438 3.1 % 8 1.8 % Total $ 10,357 21.4 % $ 7,281 18.2 % $ 3,076 42.2 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.1%, or $1.3 million, to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, from $10.1 million in 2004. The additional expense was primarily attributed to a $1.0 million increase in selling and marketing expense for package redesign work released in the third quarter and an increase in the size of our sales force to support efforts to 22 Table of Contents grow the Pyramid brands. Selling and marketing expenses for the period ended December 31, 2005 totaled $5.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, or 15.6% and 7.3% of net beverage sales, respectively, in comparison to $4.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, or 17.1% or 8.2%, respectively for 2004. General and administrative expenses for the period ended December 31, 2005 were $3.8 million compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2004, primarily due to bonuses, executive stock based compensation, and professional and director fees. Other Income (Expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased to expense of $45,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, from income of $44,000 in 2004, primarily due to an increase in interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $520,000 in comparison to $224,000 for 2004, largely due to the interest associated with the Berkeley facility mortgage and the interest on borrowings under our line of credit, partially offset by sublease income of $217,000. Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2005, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards offset against certain deferred tax liabilities. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We do not believe that our net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established. We will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. Net Loss. We reported a net loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to a net loss of $2.7 million in 2004. The decrease in net loss of $1.6 million was primarily due to the $415,000 gain realized on the sale of excess production equipment from the Seattle brewery facility, as well as beverage sales volume increases, and the cost reduction initiatives relating to consolidating production operations, partially offset by increased freight costs and additional sales and marketing activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had a $227,000 balance of cash and cash equivalents and a $3.1 million accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, our working capital was negative at $1.4 million compared to a negative $972,000 at December 31, 2005. Our working capital was impacted negatively by executive transition costs, the excise tax settlement discussed below, as well as an increase in short term financing related to our capital lease keg financing agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased to $1.1 million from $1.3 million in 2005. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss of $506,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $891,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $198,000 in 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities primarily reflect the fact that we sold brewery equipment assets in 2005 which generated $783,000 in cash. Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $364,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to approximately $646,000 for 2005. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year was primarily due to payment to the TTB in connection with the excise tax settlement, no net payments or borrowings on the line of credit as of December 31, 2006 compared to $400,000 in cash paid in the prior year as well as a decrease of cash dividends paid. In March 2007, we renegotiated our line of credit agreement with First Mutual Bank which makes available through March 31, 2008, a $2.5 million line of credit. A portion of the line of credit, $345,000, has been reserved to support the standby letter of credit for the keg lease agreement (Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Any borrowings are subject to an interest rate of prime plus 0.5%, fully floating, with a 0.8% commitment fee. Under the terms of the agreement, we must limit capital expenditures to $3.25 million and adhere to certain financial performance covenants with a restriction on the payment of future dividends. The beverage segment operates with relatively short accounts receivable terms and the alehouse segment operates essentially as a cash business, as such we typically tend to collect within 30 days of a sale or immediately upon sale. Therefore, we generally do not require significant cash on hand to meet operating needs. 23 Table of Contents We settled with the TTB in 2006 (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) and agreed to pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by the Portland Brewing Company for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its rights to receive a refund of those excise tax payments. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an initial payment of $50,000, and the remaining balance will be payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at a variable interest rate estimated at 8%. In January 2007, we completed the sale of the TK Soda Assets to The Kemper Company, a new company formed by Adventure Funds, a Portland based equity investment fund. Under terms of the transaction, we received $2.8 million in cash for TK Soda Assets including the brand and intellectual property, soda kegs, vehicles and point of sale materials. The transaction includes a five year supply agreement under which Pyramid will continue to manufacture Thomas Kemper Soda products for The Kemper Company at its breweries in Portland, Oregon and Berkeley, California. Through this transaction, we are further increasing our strategic focus on our beer business and are making a number of investments in our brewing infrastructure in the coming year. This includes investments in new kegs and fermentation tanks to handle additional growth, and improvements to our packaging processes to enhance production efficiencies in our breweries to reduce costs and improve margins. We believe that our cash flow from operating activities, tighter management of capital spending and cash management in combination with various financing options, including the line of credit and capital asset leasing, should provide adequate working capital to meet our needs. Additionally, we believe that the cash provided from the sale of the TK Soda Assets will improve our liquidity by reducing our reliance on our line of credit during the seasonally slow first quarter of 2007, while allowing us to make these capital investments. However, it is possible that this cash infusion may be insufficient to meet our capital investment requirements, which would require us to seek additional capital from other sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2006, our commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows (in thousands): Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Operating leases(1) $ 5,013 $ 1,226 $ 1,955 $ 1,257 $ 575 Capital leases(2) 890 385 505 Note payable(3) 7,671 105 228 257 7,081 TTB excise tax assessment(4) 634 201 433 $ 14,208 $ 1,917 $ 3,121 $ 1,514 $ 7,656 (1) We have obligations in the form of revenue sharing provisions in certain alehouse lease agreements, based on the excess of the percentage of revenue over the minimum lease payment. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts owed under revenue sharing agreements. (2) In 2006, we acquired 14,500 of new kegs under our capital lease agreement (Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) for a total of $1.2 million, payable over a 30 month period. (3) The amounts are principal only payments as stated in securitized financing arrangement for the Berkeley Facility purchase. (4) In 2006, we settled with the TTB, resolving all issues arising from the audit including the federal tax assessments for the period at issue (Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) for a total amount of $700,000, payable in monthly installments for a period of three years. In conjunction with the Portland Brewing asset purchase, we entered into a five year earn out agreement with Portland Brewing Company which may result in additional payments to Portland Brewing based on sales of Portland Brewing brands during the earn out period through December 31, 2008. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts owed under the earn out. 24 Table of Contents Contingencies We concluded discussions with the TTB relating to the TTBs findings from its recently completed audit of the federal excise tax returns and operations of the Company. Upon completion of the audit the TTB had concluded that (a) notwithstanding our contractual arrangements with Portland Brewing relating to the production of beer at our Portland, Oregon brewery facility, we not Portland Brewing were the legal brewer at that facility and (b) that federal excise taxes on beer production at the Portland facility from January 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 had been underpaid. These contractual arrangements were originally premised on the understanding that they would result in Portland Brewing being deemed the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility, which would have resulted in lower federal excise tax costs on beer produced at that facility because Portland Brewing is a small brewer that pays excise taxes at a lower rate on the first 60,000 barrels it produces. After we were notified of the TTBs conclusions from the audit, we engaged in discussions with the TTB regarding a compromise of the TTBs proposed assessment relating to our underpayment of excise taxes and explored with the TTB whether our commercial relationship with Portland Brewing could be modified so that in the future we met the TTBs requirements for a valid contract brewing arrangement. As a result of our discussions with the TTB, we reached a settlement with the TTB that we would pay $700,000 to resolve all issues arising from the audit, including the federal tax assessment for the period at issue, which includes a credit for the excise taxes previously paid by Portland Brewing for the period at issue due to Portland Brewings waiver of its right to receive a refund of those excise tax payments (the Settlement). Under the terms of the Settlement, we were obligated to make an initial payment of $50,000, with the balance payable in monthly installments of principal and interest for a period of three years, at an interest rate that is currently estimated to be approximately 8%. We recognized the $700,000 Settlement as a charge to earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. We anticipate that our current operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy the payment terms described above. In addition, based on our discussions with the TTB, we concluded that it was not practical to modify our relationship with Portland Brewing to comply with the TTBs interpretations of federal excise tax laws so that Portland Brewing would be respected as the legal brewer at the Portland brewery facility. Consequently, we elected to terminate the Production Agreement dated February 14, 2006 as amended July 31, 2006 between us and Portland Brewing (the Production Agreement) by written notice to Portland Brewing dated September 28, 2006. The termination of the Production Agreement was effective on November 30, 2006. In addition to the Production Agreement, certain related agreements between us and Portland Brewing will terminate per their respective terms when the Production Agreement terminates. In June 2005, Sound Beverages, a former distributor of ours, filed a suit in King County Superior Court against us. The suit alleged that we had violated Washingtons Wholesale Distributor/Supplier Equity Act, RCW 19.126, by unreasonably withholding consent to the transfer of distribution rights to Columbia Distribution. We contend that we were within our rights to reasonably withhold consent, and are contesting this matter including the $450,000 in damages claimed by Sound Beverages. This matter is in the early stages of arbitration. Management believes that the ultimate outcome to us will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the matter discussed above, we are involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any such claims, proceedings or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies To prepare financial statements that conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP), management must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our accounting estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 25 Table of Contents readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following: Inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first in, first out basis and market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value. We regularly review our inventories for the presence of excess and obsolete inventory using criteria such as age, quality, seasonal demand forecasts and branding changes, and write off or adjust the inventory to carrying value. Long Lived Assets Impairment. We review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Our evaluation is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. Long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less the estimated costs to sell. Long lived assets are written down to their estimated net fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis in the event of an impairment. If circumstances related to our long lived assets change, our valuation of the long lived assets could materially change. Goodwill Impairment. We review our goodwill, which relates entirely to our previous acquisition of Thomas Kemper Soda, annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances occur. Goodwill was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2006, pending the sale of the Thomas Kemper Soda Brand, which occurred in January 2007. Allowance for Keg Deposits. We purchase kegs from vendors and record these assets in property, plant and equipment. When the kegs are shipped to the distributors, a keg deposit is collected based on, among other things, the size of the keg and the destination point and is refunded to the distributors upon return of the kegs to us. The keg deposit liability is recorded as a current liability. On a periodic basis, typically annually, management is required to make certain estimates regarding the physical count of kegs in the marketplace, estimated loss of kegs, expectations regarding keg returns and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of keg deposit liabilities and keg assets in property, plant and equipment at the date of the financial statements. Actual keg deposit liability could differ from the estimates. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized at the time of shipment, when the title of our products passes to the customer in accordance with distributor sales agreements and collectibility is probable. We do not have standard terms that permit return of product. The cost for product returns are recorded in cost of sales and revenue is reduced at the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is returned. Beverage segment revenues under the commercial arrangements with the Portland Brewing Company were recorded on a gross basis pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent as it was a principal in accordance with the indicators which include the following: (i) being the primary obligor in the arrangement; (ii) having latitude in establishing price; (iii) having discretion in supplier selection; (iv) determination of product or service specifications; and (v) having credit risk. Stock based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes option pricing method, which requires the input 26 Table of Contents of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures) and, ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the options for only the portion of options expected to vest. Therefore, we applied an estimated forfeiture rate that we derived from historical employee termination behavior. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from our estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. Additionally, the risk free interest rate used in the Black Scholes valuation method is based on the implied yield currently available in U.S. Treasury securities at maturity with an equivalent term. We have not provided for a dividend assumption in the Black Scholes valuation method for grants beginning in 2005 as we ceased paying any dividends in early 2005 and currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the future. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently, the related expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Realization of Deferred Tax Assets. We evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is based on existing deferred tax liabilities and an assessment of our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income. We record a valuation allowance to the extent that recovery is not likely. If circumstances related to our ability to generate future U.S. taxable income change, our evaluation of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could materially change. Promotional Activities. Throughout the year, our sales force engages in promotional activities with our distributor and retail customers. In connection with financial statement preparation and other financial reporting, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures resulting from these activities. Actual expenditures incurred could differ from managements estimates and assumptions. If managements estimates and assumptions differ from the actual promotional activities incurred a timing difference could result either understating or overstating the actual promotional activity expense in a subsequent period. Because of the nature of promotional activities and the historical trends used in management analysis, management does not consider the potential timing differences to be a significant risk in the financial statement presentation. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment (Revised 2004), which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the fair value of all employee share based payments, including grants of employee stock options as well as compensatory employee stock purchase plans. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 which expresses the views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations. In April 2005, the SEC issued a press release that amends the required adoption date of SFAS No. 123R as no later than the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which was effective for our quarterly results as of and for the period ended March 31, 2006. We adopted the modified prospective transition method. During 2006, we recorded $321,000 of stock based compensation expenses including $69,000 stock based compensation associated with implementing SFAS No. 123(R). In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation), which states that a company may adopt a policy for presenting taxes on a gross or net basis. If taxes are significant, the accounting policy should be disclosed, and if taxes are presented gross, the amounts included in revenue should be disclosed. The consensus reached on this Issue is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2006 with early application permitted. As our accounting policy is to present excise taxes on a gross basis as described in the EITF 06 3, our policy and disclosure presentation are already in accordance with EITF No. 06 3. 27 Table of Contents In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions including whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The impact of adopting FIN No. 48 will not be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement (rollover) approach and a balance sheet (iron curtain) approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2007 annual financial statements. We adopted SAB 108 effective January 1, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased beginning accumulated deficit by $258,000, and increased deferred rent by $174,000 (Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. The Statement permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements in order to facilitate comparisons between entities choosing different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 does not affect existing accounting requirements for certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value. This statement is effective for us as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the impact on the financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We currently do not hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities, nor have we engaged in such activities in the past. Also, we did not have any outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2006 due to the fact that we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit. Further, we do not enter into significant transactions denominated in foreign currency. Accordingly, our direct exposure to risks arising from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments is not material. 28 Table of Contents
