ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Critical accounting policies and estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 17 Goodwill We account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the book value to the market value (market capitalization plus a control premium). If the market value exceeds the book value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If our book value exceeds the market value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis. Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed. We completed the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2006, in which no impairment was identified. Goodwill was $11,200,000 as of December 31, 2006. Equity based compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified prospective transition method, and therefore have not restated prior periods results. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all equity based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006 and prior to but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), we recognize equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award. Prior to SFAS No.123(R) adoption, we accounted for equity based payments under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly did not recognize equity based compensation related to these options, as the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The Black Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility, the risk free interest rate, the options expected life and the dividend yield on the underlying stock. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors. Risk free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded risk free rates for the appropriate term. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards require the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards represent managements best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. Revenue Recognition We expect to earn our revenue primarily from software licenses and related services. Our revenue will be recognized in accordance with Statement of Position 97 2 (SOP 97 2), as amended by Statement of Position 98 9. 18 The Companys revenues were derived from its discontinued scanning services operated by Lifesyne. Scan revenue is recognized when the service is delivered. The recognition of revenues from software licenses and related services will require difficult and complex judgments. The terms of the license contract, such as whether the contract is long term (over 12 months) or short term, cancelable or non cancelable and the basis on which the licensee is charged , for example, will affect the recognition of revenues from services, such as up front fees on installation, activation and up front license fees, on going license fees, termination fees and maintenance fees. Where fees are received prior to any service being delivered, the recognition of the fees is deferred until the related service has been delivered successfully. Recognition of fees that relate to any milestone is deferred until the milestone has been achieved. The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue and establishment of reserves for uncollectable amounts in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) it requires management to make assumptions about future collections, and (2) the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates on the accounts receivable balance reported on our consolidated balance sheets and the results reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material. Further the Company has no history of uncollectable amounts and therefore must initially look to the estimates for the industry or particular companies that the management feels operate in a similar environment in addition to any current market indicators about general economic conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts. Research and Development Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products that are intended for sale are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Costs incurred prior to technological feasibility being established for the product are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detail program design or, in its absence, completion of a working model. Thereafter, all software production costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to the straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Amortization commences when the product is available for general release to customers. The Company concluded that capitalizing such expenditures on completion of a working model was inappropriate because the Company did not incur any material software production costs and therefore has decided to expense all research and development costs. The Companys research and development costs are comprised of staff and consultancy costs expensed on the Medicsight products. Impairment of Long lived Assets and Long lived Assets To Be Disposed of The Company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Companys assessment for impairment of an asset involves estimating the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. An impairment loss recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Calculating the estimated fair value of an asset involves significant judgments and a variety of assumptions. Judgments that the Company makes concerning the value of its intangible assets include assessing time and cost involved for development, time to market, and risks of regulatory failure or obsolescence, (due to market, environmental or technological advances for example). For calculating fair value based on discounted cash flows, we forecast future operating results and future cash flows, which include long term forecasts of revenue growth, gross margins and capital expenditures. An impairment analysis was performed as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the Company concluded there was no impairment loss. 19 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the operation of our international subsidiaries. Our main operating currency is UK sterling().We also have subsidiary operations in Japan and China who operate in their local currencies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 Research and Development The Companys research and development expenses for Fiscal 2006 were $2,870,000 as compared to $2,363,000 for Fiscal 2005. The Companys research and development costs were comprised of staff, staff related, consultancy, stock options, and product development software costs expensed on the research and development of Medicsights PLCss products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for Fiscal 2006 were $12,842,000 as compared to $9,300,000 for Fiscal 2005, the significant items being (in thousands): 2006 2005 Salaries and directors compensation (including payroll taxes) $ 3,938 $ 3,884 Contractors and consultants 687 266 People costs 4,625 4,150 Stock options 403 Professional fees 1,087 507 Property rent and rates 1,165 892 Travel 565 458 Software and related 450 72 Marketing, conferences and public relations 2,384 1,569 Recruitment fees 273 118 Points to note are: People related costs increased by $475,000 (11%) as we expanded our operations in Medicsight and Medicexchange in Japan and China respectively. Recruitment fees also increased year on year as a result. Professional fees increased $580,000 (114%) due to international expansion and increased work on commercial agreements. Software and related increased $378,000 (525%) as we expensed the initial website build costs and ongoing hosting fees of medicexchange.com Marketing, conferences and public relations increased $815,000 (52%) as a result of supporting our Medicsight partners, promoting our international presence and building the Medicexchange business and brand. 20 Income Tax Benefit Realized In Fiscal 2005, Medicsight PLC received a tax credit of $858,000 from the United Kingdom taxation authorities under its Research & Development tax relief scheme for small and medium sized enterprises. The tax credit relates to expenditures incurred between November 2001 and December 2003. The Company has not accrued for any subsequent tax credits as it has determined that the completion date (under rules of the scheme) of the new technology occurred at the end of Fiscal 2003. Net Loss and Net Loss per Share Net loss was $14,935,000 for Fiscal 2006 compared to a net loss of $12,216,000 for Fiscal 2005. Net loss per share for Fiscal 2006 was $0.39 (based on weighted average shares outstanding of 38,092,965), compared to $0.36 for Fiscal 2005 (based on weighted average shares outstanding of 34,224,023). The increase net loss for Fiscal 2006 is principally due to the increase in selling, general and administrative costs and reduction in realized income tax benefit. Operational currency The Companys main operating currency is UK sterling (). Its results of operations are affected by changes in the $: rates used to translate the operational result. For Fiscal 2006, the average rate was $1.85:1.00 and for Fiscal 2005 the rate was $1.80:1.00, an increase of 2.8%. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Companys corporate offices are at the Kensington Centre, 66 Hammersmith Road, London W14 4UD, UK. This property is leased on a 10 year agreement with a right to terminate on the expiry of the fifth year of the lease. The Company has offices in New York, Tokyo (Japan) and Beijing (China) with notice periods of between one and three months to cancel. Our minimum annual lease commitments under these arrangements are (in thousands): Year Ending 2007 $ 480 2008 649 2009 475 2010 448 2011 178 Later Years 1,865 Total $ 4,095 As of December 31, 2006, the Company was party to a capital lease obligation in the amount of $7,000 for motor vehicles. The obligation for the vehicle lease requires monthly payments of $1,700, including interest, through April 2007. The underlying vehicles secure the lease. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2005 vs. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2004 Research and Development The Companys research and development expenses for Fiscal 2005 were $2,363,000 as compared to $2,972,000 for Fiscal 2004. The decrease of $609,000 was due to reduction in the numbers of staff required for the development of the products. The Companys research and development costs were comprised of staff and consultancy costs expensed on the development of Medicsight PLCs software products. 21 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for Fiscal 2005 were $9,300,000 as compared to $10,578,000 for Fiscal 2004. The decrease of approximately $1,300,000 was due to a number of factors: Salaries and directors and sub contractors compensation declined from $5,009,000 in Fiscal 2004 to $4,595,000 in Fiscal 2005 due to reduction in staff numbers and the reduction of sub contractors costs (re structuring of the medical boards). Rent, rates and service charges declined from $1,623,000 in Fiscal 2004 to $1,418,000 due to the Company requiring less space in 46 Berkeley Square in 2005. Other savings include travel (due to Companys review of its requirements in 2005 $154,000), the cessation of the clinical trial in 2004 and subsequent reduction in medical images costs ($440,000) and a reduction in depreciation following 2004s impairment review ($348,000). For Fiscal 2005, the Company did not record an impairment charge from continuing operations. For Fiscal 2004, the Company recorded an impairment to Medicsight Asset Managements property and equipment of $386,000 which relates to the closure of the Ravenscourt centre. This was as a result of the decision to transfer Medicsight Asset Managements assets to Medicsight PLC and Lifesyne or sell to independent third parties at open market value or fully impair, as its business opportunities were limited due to the change in strategy by Lifesyne. Impairment Loss on Investments For Fiscal 2005 there was no impairment charge on investments as compared to Fiscal 2004 where the Company incurred an impairment loss on investments of $70,000 relating to the impairment in the carrying value of Eurindia PLC (Eurindia). The Company based this impairment on information provided by Eurindias management. Income Tax Benefit Realized In Fiscal 2005, Medicsight PLC received $858,000 relating to a tax credit paid by the United Kingdom taxation authorities under its R&D tax relief scheme for small and medium businesses. The basis for the R&D relief is to encourage the development of new technologies and is only applicable to the research and development of a new technology and not a product. The tax credit relates to expenditures incurred between November 2001 and December 2003. The Company did not accrue for any potential tax credit for Fiscal 2004 as it has determined that the completion date of the new technology occurred at the end of Fiscal 2003. Discontinued operations The revenue from the Companys discontinued Lifesynes scanning operations for Fiscal 2005 was $427,000 as compared to $538,000 for Fiscal 2004. The reduction was due mainly to the 10 month trading period in Fiscal 2005. The selling, general and administrative expenses from the Companys discontinued Lifesynes scanning operations for Fiscal 2005 was $1,511,000 as compared to $2,101,000 for Fiscal 2004. The reduction was mainly due to a reduction in staff and the 10 month trading period in Fiscal 2005. For Fiscal 2005, the Company recorded impairment of $394,000 against property and equipment related to the discontinued Lifesyne operations. For Fiscal 2004, the Company recorded impairment of $582,000 against property and equipment related to the discontinued Lifesyne operations. 22 Operational currency As the Companys operating currency is UK sterling () its results of operations are affected by changes in the $: rates used to translate the revenues and costs. For Fiscal 2005 the average rate was $1.80: 1.00 and for Fiscal 2004 the rate was $1.83: 1.00, a decrease of 1.7%. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of December 31, 2005, the Company was party to a capital lease obligation in the amount of $25,000 for motor vehicles. The obligation for the vehicle lease requires monthly payments of $1,700, including interest, through April 2007. The underlying vehicles secure the lease. On May 25, 2005, the Companys discontinued Lifesyne operations settled the outstanding capital lease obligation for its scanner which was subsequently sold. The outstanding capital lease obligation was $286,000 as of December 31, 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working Capital information as at December 31 (in thousands unless stated): 2006 2005 2004 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities $ 24,735 $ 11,249 $ 5,276 Current Assets 25,306 11,867 6,515 Current Liabilities (3,378 ) (2,746 ) (2,353 ) Working Capital Surplus $ 21,928 $ 9,121 $ 4,162 Ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities 7.5 4.3 2.8 Net change in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2006 we had $19,757,000 in cash and cash equivalents (compared to $7,249,000 at December 31, 2005) and $24,735,000 in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash for common stock subscribed but unissued, compared to $11,249,000 at December 31, 2005. Net cash used in operating activities was $13,990,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 ($8,998,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005). This resulted primarily from: a. our net loss of $14,935,000 ($10,738,000 for Fiscal 2005), after Minority Interest of $477,000 (nil in Fiscal 2005); b. adjusted for depreciation and stock based compensation expenses (non cash items) of $718,000 ($237,000 for Fiscal 2005); c. losses on disposal of fixed assets were $13,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $219,000 in the year ended December 31, 2005; d. an overall net reduction in the movement on current assets (excluding cash items and marketable securities) and current liabilities of $691,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006 (compared to $1,284,0000 in Fiscal 2005) primarily due to the payment of commissions to Asia IT Capital 23 Investments Limited (a related party) and the timing of payments in the year ended December 31, 2006; e. $nil impact of the losses of the Lifesyne (discontinued) business activities in the year ended December 31, 2006 versus a $1,478,000 loss from Lifesyne activities in the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in investing activities of $1,255,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006 (compared to $3,388,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005), which consisted primarily of: a. a $4,000,000 decrease in cash held for common stock subscribed but unissued; b. a cash outflow of $4,533,000 for the purchase of available for sale marketable securities in the year ended December 31, 2006; c. a cash outflow of $722,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006 from the purchase of fixed assets. In the year ended December 31, 2005 we had a net $169,000 cash inflow from the sale of fixed assets; Net cash flows from financing activities were $27,586,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 (compared to $15,346,000 December 31, 2005), consisting mainly of: a. $27,604,000 net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in MGT Capital Investments Inc (formerly Medicsight Inc), Medicsight PLC and Medicexchange PLC being $31,204,000 of total new money received in the year ended December 31, 2006 less the $3,600,000 net movement of monies received for common stock subscribed but unissued. For the year ended December 31, 2005 we received $12,035,000 net new money plus $3,600,000 of monies received from common stock subscribed but unissued at December 31, 2005. b. A reduction in our principal payments under our capital lease obligations in the year ended December 31, 2006 we paid $18,000 compared to $289,000 paid in the year ended December 31, 2005. In the nine months ended December 31, 2006 we had $nil cash flows from the discontinued Lifesyne activities. In the nine months ended December 31, 2005 we had cash outflows of $1,122,000 from Lifesyne activities. Additional capital funding requirements To date we have primarily financed our operations through private placements of equity securities. At December 31, 2006 we had issued 38,900,383 of our 40,000,000 authorized share capital. We have also raised finance through the sale of the common stock of our principal subsidiaries Medicsight PLC and Medicexchange PLC. In addition to the above, we still have the two lines of credit facilities (together totaling $38 million) available from Asia IT Capital Investments Limited (a related party). We do not anticipate having to use any part of these credit lines. Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Future Capital Requirements To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or equity related securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to the Companys stockholders. No assurance can be given, however, that we will have access to the capital markets in the future, or that financing will be available on acceptable terms to satisfy the Companys cash requirements to implement its business strategies. 24 If we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain acceptable financing, our results of operations and financial conditions could be materially and adversely affected. We may be required to raise substantial additional funds through other means. Our technology has not yet been fully commercialized and we have not begun to receive any significant revenues from commercial operations. We cannot assure our stockholders that our technology and products will be commercialized successfully, or that if so commercialized, that revenues will be sufficient to fund our operations. If adequate funds are not available to us, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products that we would not otherwise relinquish. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle must be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company has completed its initial evaluation of the impact of the January 1, 2007 adoption of FIN No. 48 and determined that such adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, it does not require any new fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on its financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No.159 will have on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 108 regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. The provisions of this statement will be effective for the year ended December 31, 2006. The impact on the financial statements for 2006 is immaterial. 25 ITEM 7A QUANTATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We place our investments in a mixture of (a) cash deposits on either overnight or 30 day rates; (b) highly liquid blue chip available for sale market securities. A decline in interest rate would have an advserse impact on interest income. We do not have any debt and we do not use derivative financial instruments. The Company has the following debt facilities all repayable on demand: Debt Holder Facility Draw Down Interest rate At December 31, 2006 Asia IT Capital Investments Ltd $ 20,000,000 $ 0 US LIBOR + 2 % 7.34 % Asia IT Capital Investments Ltd $ 19,600,000 $ 0 Sterling LIBOR + 2 % 7.28 % Since the Company has not drawn down funds under either facility, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not increase the Companys interest costs, assuming no draw downs are made which the Company does not anticipate having to use. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the operation of our international subsidiaries. Our main operating currency is UK sterling (). We also have subsidiary operations in Japan and China who operate in their local currencies. At the end of each reporting period, expenses of the subsidiaries are converted into U.S. dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period and assets and liabilities are converted into U.S. dollars using either historical rates or the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to payments we make to vendors and suppliers using foreign currencies. We currently do not hedge against this foreign currency risk. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact our financial condition and results of operations. 26
