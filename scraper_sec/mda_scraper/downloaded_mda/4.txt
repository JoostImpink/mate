Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." Product Development The Company expended approximately $2.5, $2.2 and $1.9 million for Company sponsored research and development, both hardware and software, during fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Software is becoming a greater portion of the total development effort as the complexity of the product increases with the use of integrated circuits and microprocessors. The Companys current efforts are directed at improving and enhancing its product line through the introduction of successor models with higher performance levels, greater capacity and more attractive packaging and lower costs through miniaturization and the increased use of integrated circuitry. 4 6 For 1996, the Company has introduced three new product offerings. These are the OMNI CIX M(TM), a mini omni directional scanner, the CiMAX 7800, a high performance fixed position laser scanner with auto focus capabilities, and the CiMAX 6100 Controller, an open systems terminal which provides both decoding and code reconstruction functions. Two significant product introductions for 1995 were the CiMAX 7500, an intelligent, fixed position laser scanner, and the CiMAX 6000, an open systems based data collection terminal. Government Regulation The Office of Radiological Health (ORH) of the Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations applicable to manufacturers of laser products. Such regulations classify laser products by assessable radiation levels and establish standards for protective housing, safety interlocks and the affixing of labels alerting users not to stare into the laser beam. ORH also requires manufacturers to file annual laser product reports. The Company believes that it has complied with these regulations. While the nature and scope of these regulations could change in the future, the Company would not expect the same to have a material affect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Employees As of December 31, 1995, the Company had 138 full time employees and 6 part time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements with the Company. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be excellent.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income for 1995 was $683,000 and represents the Companys first profitable year since 1992. The last two years, 1994 and 1993, reflected significant changes within the Company. A new President and Chief Executive Officer was appointed in 1993 and a cost savings and reduction in work force program was accomplished in 1994. These efforts resulted in one time separation charges of $469,000 and $541,000 for 1994 and 1993, respectively. The net loss was $510,000 and $1,026,000 for 1994 and 1993, respectively. Revenues for 1995 were 7% above 1994 results. European and Rest of World revenues in 1995 increased by 24% and 22%, respectively. North America revenue declined by 11% in 1995 as compared to 1994. Revenues for 1994 were 19% above 1993 results and excluding the substantial 1993 Canada Post contract, revenue would have increased 30% on a year to year comparative basis. The 1994 revenue gains were reflected in all three geographic areas of the Company. Bookings increased 10% for 1995 and 1994 compared to the prior year. Backlog at December 31 was $3.5, $3.1 and $3.7 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Revenue growth is primarily attributable to: a broader product line; recovery of the European economy; increased penetration in the Far East/Asia market; and improved sales productivity in North America in 1994. Service revenue increased 5% in 1995 as compared to 1994. Service revenue in 1994 was 25% below 1993 levels primarily due to two factors: first, a 20% one time increase in service revenues in 1993 due to the Canada Post contract and second, the elimination from the service base of those older products that have been removed from the Companys product line. Sales by the Companys four European subsidiaries, the Canadian subsidiary, and exports to the Rest of the World were 60%, 52% and 57% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The high 1993 level is due to the Canada Post contract, which accounted for almost 10% of the total worldwide revenue. The significantly high 1995 level is due to the 20% plus revenue growth in Europe and Rest of World coupled with a softening in the North American market. Since more than half of the Companys revenue is derived from foreign sources, its operating results can be sensitive to foreign currency fluctuations. In 1995, these foreign currency fluctuations worked in the Companys favor. The Company has available through a domestic commercial bank a program available to hedge its foreign denominated accounts receivable in an effort to minimize foreign currency exposure. These hedging activities are basic, straightforward arrangements and do not involve the use of any other unusual forms of derivatives. At December 31, 1995, the Company did not have any hedging contracts outstanding. Gross margin from product and services was 49%, 48% and 46% for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Product gross margin was 50%, 48% and 47% for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The increase in 1995 product gross margin to 50% reflects manufacturing efficiencies, primarily due to subcontracting components such as circuit boards on a complete turnkey basis. Service gross margin in 1995 and 1994 was 45% and 46%, respectively. These two years were both higher than the 44% level in 1993 and reflect two factors: first, the elimination from the service base of those older products that have been removed from the Companys product line, and second, cost reductions from the 1994 restructuring program. The Company has implemented a change in distribution strategy in the North American business from direct to lower margin indirect channels. To achieve the Companys goals of a continued 9 11 positive gross margin trend will require further material and labor cost reductions in manufacturing which must more than offset the effect of the larger mix of international revenues with lower margins and the change in distribution strategy in North America. Selling, General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 38%, 40% and 40% in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Gross spending for these expenses in 1995 were held constant while revenue increased by 7%. Research and development expenses were 9% of revenue in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively as the Company continued its planned program of spending on new product development. The Companys provisions for income taxes were $13,000, $64,000, and $63,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Due to the Companys ability to use its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, the provision for income taxes is comprised primarily of state and foreign income taxes for which net operating loss carryforwards are not available. The Companys revenue reflects no significant inflationary impact during the period since prices have either been constant or slightly reduced. While the exact impact is not quantifiable, inflation has increased labor costs as a component of sales and selling costs and general and administrative expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management believes that continued profitable operations and the current level of working capital are sufficient to finance its needs through 1996. From a capital expenditures viewpoint, the only material capital expenditure planned for 1996 is a new management information system which has been purchased for approximately $200,000. The liquidity results over the periods under discussion are: December 31, December 31, December 31, 1995 1994 1993 Working Capital $6,335,000 $5,299,000 $5,143,000 Current Ratio 2.2 to 1 2.1 to 1 2.2 to 1 Total Liability to Net Worth Ratio .8 to 1 .8 to 1 .7 to 1 Each of the liquidity factors listed have remained relatively stable as of the dates listed. Working capital has increased by $1 million in 1995 compared to 1994, primarily resulting from an increase in inventory of $521,000 and a decrease in other current liabilities of $495,000. The Company currently has two bank lines of credit available. A small line of credit is held with a Belgium bank for 5 million Belgium Francs (approximately $170,000). The principal line of credit, in the amount of $1 million, is held with a commercial bank. Computer Identics GmbH, a wholly owned German subsidiary, borrowed in DM the entire $1 million line of credit from this commercial bank. The loan is a demand note at an interest rate of 7%. These funds were used to pay down their intercompany accounts payable balance due to the Company. The Companys cash balance at 10 12 December 31, 1995 reflects the proceeds from the draw down of the $1 million line of credit. The Company also has available a program to hedge its foreign denominated accounts receivable in an effort to minimize foreign currency exposure. At December 31, 1995, the Company did not have any hedging contracts outstanding, but may utilize limited hedging in the future should the Company foresee the need.
