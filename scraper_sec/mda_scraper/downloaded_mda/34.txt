ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of the consolidated results of operation and financial condition of the company for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 1996 should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere herein. GENERAL The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and gas properties. The Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration, and development costs incurred. Proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties are credited to the full cost pool. Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on an overall unit of production method using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers. Costs amortized include all capitalized costs (less accumulated amortization); the estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and estimated dismantlement, restoration, and abandonment costs. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes of, average sales prices received for, and average production costs associated with, and depletion rate associated with the Companys sales of oil and gas for the periods indicated. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 1995 1996 Net Production: Gas (MMcf)...................................... $ 3,940 10,403 10,215 Oil (MBbls)..................................... 100.1 430.8 273.5 Average Sales Price: Gas (per Mcf)(1)(2)............................. $ 1.99 $ 1.70 $ 2.35 Oil (per Bbl)................................... $ 14.35 $ 18.14 $ 21.41 Average Production Cost: (per MCFE)(3)................................... $ 0.50 $ 0.24 $ 0.31 Depletion Rate: (per MCFE)...................................... $ 0.94 $ 1.04 $ 1.33 (1) Includes natural gas liquids. (2) $2.35 per Mcf in 1996 is the price net of hedging transactions. The average price per Mcf excluding hedging transactions was $2.58 per Mcf. (3) Includes direct lifting costs (labor, repairs and maintenance, materials and supplies) and the administrative costs of production offices, insurance and property and severance taxes. 1996 COMPARED WITH 1995 Revenues. Total revenues increased $4.3 million (17%) to $30.3 million for 1996 from $26.0 million for 1995. The increase in revenues was due to higher average oil and gas prices in 1996, partially offset by decreases in production. The decreases in production resulted from the natural production rate decline in the Companys properties developed prior to 1996 exceeding new production from wells brought online in 1996. CORPDAL:61486.5 15467 00006 16 Expenses. Total expenses increased $3.0 million (14%) to $23.7 million for 1996 from $20.7 million for 1995. An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") is the primary source for the increase in expenses. DD&A increased $2.4 million (17%) to $16.0 million for 1996 from $13.6 million in 1995 due to an increase in the depletion rate partially offset by the decrease in production. Lease operating costs and production taxes increased $630,000 (20%) to $3.7 million for 1996 compared with $3.1 million for 1995 due primarily to pipeline transportation fees related to the production from Mustang Island Block 858, Vermilion Block 203 and Main Pass Block 262. Changes in administrative costs and interest expense were insignificant. Net Income. Net income increased $1.4 million (27%) to $6.6 million for 1996 from $5.2 million in 1995. The primary reason for the increase in net income was increased oil and gas prices. 1995 COMPARED WITH 1994 Revenues. Total revenues increased $16.3 million (168%) to $26.0 million for 1995 from $9.7 million for 1994. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the new production from the Companys interest in East Cameron Blocks 331/332, Matagorda Block 710 and Ship Shoal Block 251 coupled with higher average oil prices in 1995 partially offset by lower average gas prices in 1995. Expenses. Total expenses increased $11.6 million (129%) to $20.7 million for 1995 from $9.1 million for 1994. An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") is the primary source for the increase in expenses. DD&A increased $9.3 million (215%) to $13.6 million for 1995 from $4.3 million in 1994 due to increased production coupled with an increase in the depletion rate. Interest expense increased $1.4 million (124%) to $2.5 million for 1995 from $1.1 million for 1994 because of an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. Lease operating costs and production taxes increased $827,000 (36%) to $3.1 million for 1995 compared with $2.3 million for 1994. Lease operating expenses increased because of increased production. Reflected in the 1994 lease operating expense amount are expenses related to the Texas Panhandle properties that were sold in August 1994. Production costs on a per unit basis decreased significantly because East Cameron Blocks 331/332, Matagorda Block 710 and Ship Shoal Block 251 all have a low per unit operating cost, while the Texas Panhandle properties sold in August 1994 had a high per unit operating cost. Administrative expenses increased $177,000 (13%) to $1.5 million in 1995 from $1.3 million in 1994 principally due to an increase in legal, salary and printing expenses partially offset by increased overhead capitalization relating to technical staff associated with exploration activity. Net Income. Net income increased $4.6 million (700%) to $5.2 million for 1995 from $654,000 in 1994. The primary reason for the increase in net income was the increase in production. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY At December 31, 1996, the Company had existing cash and cash investments of $6.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.0 million for 1996, compared with $15.8 million for 1995. The primary reason for this increase in cash provided by operating activities was higher results of operations (or earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization) coupled with decreased working capital requirements. Net cash used in investing activities for 1996 was $49.9 million compared with $23.1 million in 1995. This increase was principally due to expenditures for exploration and development prospects. Net cash provided by financing activities for 1996 was $25.8 million compared with $8.6 million in 1995. The cash provided by financing activities during 1996 was from net borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility. In general, because the Companys oil and gas reserves are depleted by production, the success of its business strategy is dependent on a continuous exploration and development program. Therefore, the Companys capital requirements relate primarily to the acquisition of undeveloped leasehold acreage and exploration and development activities. The Company is currently pursuing a number of existing exploration prospects and plans to participate in Gulf of Mexico lease sales during 1997. CORPDAL:61486.5 15467 00006 17 The Companys operating needs and capital spending programs have been funded by borrowing under its bank credit facilities, proceeds from public offerings of its Common Stock and cash flow from operations. The Company expects to continue with an active exploration program and plans to drill ten additional exploration wells and six development wells in 1997. The Company expects capital expenditures during 1997 to total approximately $47 million. At December 31, 1996, the Companys capital resources consisted primarily of cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under the INCC Credit Agreement. Management believes that cash flow from operations along with the amount available under the INCC Credit Agreement will be sufficient to finance the currently planned capital expenditures through December 1997. If the Company is successful in substantially all of its currently scheduled exploration prospects, additional funds may be required in order to conduct the necessary development activities. Additionally, if the Company is unsuccessful in its currently scheduled exploration program, additional funds may be required in order to continue the exploration and development program. If necessary, the Company may seek to raise additional capital in public or private equity or debt markets. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to raise such capital if needed or on terms that are favorable to the Company. Any resulting lack of sufficient capital may require the Company to reduce its interest in such properties or to forego developing such reserves and may require the Company to curtail its exploration and development program. In addition, the Company does not act as operator with respect to a majority of its properties. The Company may not be able to control the exploration or development activities or the associated costs with respect to properties operated by other parties. Credit Facility. The Company has a credit agreement as amended (the INCC Credit Agreement) with ING (U.S.) Capital Corporation, f/k/a Internationale Nederlanden (U.S.) Capital Corporation (INCC), Mees Pierson, N.V. (Mees Pierson) and Credit Lyonnais (Credit Lyonnais) (together, the bank group). The INCC Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Companys assets. It contains financial covenants which require the Company to maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities (excluding the current portion of related debt) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a tangible net worth of not less than $40 million. The Company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants. Prior to June 28, 1996, outstanding borrowings accrued interest at either INCCs fluctuating base rate or INCCs reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate plus 1.5% at the Companys option. On June 28, 1996, the INCC Credit Agreement was amended (the Third Amendment) to decrease the addition to the INCC reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate from 1.5% to 1.25% as long as outstanding borrowings are less than 75% of the borrowing base. The borrowing base was also increased from $45 million to $50 million. On November 7, 1996 the Company further amended (the Fourth Amendment) the INCC Credit Agreement. Under the Fourth Amendment, Credit Lyonnais joined as a lender under the INCC Credit Agreement. Also under the Fourth Amendment, the original facility under the INCC Credit Agreement was designated as Facility A and the maximum amount of the facility was increased in amount from $50 million to $75 million; provided, however, that the maximum amount available to the Company cannot exceed the borrowing base of its properties as determined from time to time by the lenders. The borrowing base under Facility A was reconfirmed as of November 7, 1996 as $50 million. The revolving period of borrowings under Facility A was extended from March 31, 1997 to September 30, 1997. On September 30, 1997 the borrowings outstanding under Facility A will be converted to a term loan that requires quarterly repayments of principal on a revised schedule through March 31, 2001. The Companys ability to borrow under Facility A is dependent upon the reserve value of its oil and gas properties. If the reserve value of the Companys borrowing base declines, the amount available to the Company under Facility A will be reduced and, to the extent that the borrowing base is less than the amount then outstanding under Facility A, the Company will be obligated to repay such excess amount on 30 days notice from INCC or to provide additional collateral. INCC, Mees Pierson, N.V., and Credit Lyonnais have substantial discretion in determining the reserve value of the borrowing base. In addition, a second facility was created under the Fourth Amendment. This new standby credit facility, Facility B, is for the amount of $14 million. Facility B provides for three levels of borrowings by the Company, two of $5 million each and one of $4 million. There are no restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow the first $5 million under Facility B and the amount borrowed may be used for general corporate purposes. The Companys ability to borrow under the further two levels of borrowings of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, under Facility B is dependent upon the Company establishing total proved reserves at certain levels and appropriate ratios between the Companys outstanding debt and the value of its proved reserves. The Company must also CORPDAL:61486.5 15467 00006 18 submit detailed proposals, acceptable to its lenders, outlining the manner in which the second two levels of borrowings under Facility B will be used in the development of the Companys oil and gas properties. Facility B is repayable on December 31, 1997. The interest margin over INCC reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate for Facility B varies from 3.25% to 3.75%, depending upon the ratio of the amount of the outstanding loans to the value of the Companys proved reserves. Under the INCC Credit Agreement, interest is payable quarterly on any base rate borrowings and payable on maturity of any Eurodollar borrowings or at the end of three months if the maturity of the Eurodollar borrowing is in excess of three months. The Company is currently negotiating with the bank group regarding a further amendment to the INCC Credit Agreement. The Company has requested that the borrowing base under Facility A of the INCC Credit Agreement be increased from $50 million to $65 million. At the same time, the amount of Facility B would be reduced from $14 million to $10 million and certain changes would be made to the conditions attaching to Facility B. No assurance can be given that the bank group will agree to such requests and any such agreement with respect to such request will be subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive amendment to the INCC Credit Agreement. The INCC Credit Agreement does not permit the Company to pay or declare any cash or property dividends or otherwise make any distribution of capital. On Facility A the Company is obligated to pay a quarterly fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the unused portion of the borrowing base under the facility and a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit in the amount of 1.5% per annum of the face amount of such Letter of Credit. On Facility B the Company is obligated to pay a drawdown fee for each $5 million borrowed equal to 0.3% for the first $5 million, 1.15% for the second $5 million and 1.6% for the last $4 million. Also, the Company must pay 0.5% per annum on the undrawn portion of Facility B. The Company expects to have to negotiate an extension of the revolving nature of the credit facility or to negotiate a new credit facility before the end of the year. The carrying value of the Companys long term debt approximates fair value. The following table illustrates the borrowing base, the outstanding borrowings and the available borrowings under the INCC Credit Agreement at December 31, 1996. BORROWING OUTSTANDING AVAILABLE BASE BORROWINGS BORROWINGS Credit Facility Facility A......................................... $ 50,000,000 $ 42,000,000 $ 8,000,000 Facility B......................................... 14,000,000 14,000,000 $ 64,000,000 $ 42,000,000 $ 22,000,000 The Company believes that available borrowings under the INCC Credit Agreement combined with cash flows from the operations will be sufficient to fund its currently anticipated development and exploration expenses. If the Company is successful in substantially all of its currently scheduled exploration prospects, additional funds will be required in order to conduct the necessary development activities. Any resulting lack of sufficient capital may require the Company to reduce its interest in such properties or to forego developing such reserves. In addition, the Company does not act as operator with respect to most of its properties. Therefore, the Company may not be able to control the development activities or the associated costs with respect to properties operated by other parties. Net Operating Losses. At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $48 million. The net operating losses will expire principally in 2005 through 2010, if not previously utilized. Utilization of approximately $26 million of net operating loss is subject to limitations because of previous changes in ownership of the Company, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Additional net operating loss limitations may be imposed because of subsequent changes in stock ownership of the Company. CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION The Companys revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have CORPDAL:61486.5 15467 00006 19 been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices. The Companys ability to maintain its current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the Companys ability to control or predict. Although certain of the Companys costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation, inflation has not had a significant effect on the Companys results of operations during 1994, 1995 or 1996. In an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and gas on the Companys operations, management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and gas prices, usually when such prices are at or in excess of the prices anticipated in the Companys operating budget, through the use of commodity futures, options, forward contracts and swap agreements. Hedging transactions are limited by the Board of Directors such that no transaction may fix an oil and gas price for a term of more than 12 months, and the aggregate oil and gas production covered by all transactions may not exceed 50% of the Companys budgeted production for any 12 month period from the date of the transaction or 75% of the Companys budgeted production for any single month from the date of the transaction. By hedging its oil and gas prices, the Company intends to mitigate the risk of future declines in oil and gas prices. Under certain contracts should oil or gas prices increase above the contract rate, the Company will not participate in the higher prices for the production. The Company has entered into a number of gas price swap transactions under which the Company receives a fixed price per MMBtu and pays a floating price based on the settlement prices for the NYMEX Natural Gas futures contract for the delivery month. In total under these contracts the Company fixed the price of 4,065,000 MMBtu of gas for 1996 at an average price of $2.018 per MMBtu. Gas revenues were reduced $2.4 million and increased $323,000 in 1996 and 1995, respectively, as a result of hedging transactions. The Company has fixed the price of 630,000 MMBtu of gas for the period January to March 1997 at an average price of $3.32 per MMBtu. The Company may enter into certain interest rate hedging contracts. By hedging its interest rate under its credit facility, the Company would intend to mitigate the risk of future increases in interest rates. Should interest rates decrease below the contract rate, the Company will not participate in the lower interest rate for the portion of the credit facility under the hedging contract. The Company currently has no interest rate hedging contracts in place.
