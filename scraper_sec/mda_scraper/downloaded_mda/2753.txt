Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, describe certain business risks. Consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the Safe Harbor Statement at the beginning of this Form 10 K, in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this Form 10 K. 5 Table of Contents A significant portion of our revenues from product sales and services are dependent on significant customers and specific industries. Sales to Sun and Citrix combined accounted for approximately 43% and 19% of our fiscal 2006 and 2005 revenues. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, sales directly to Sun accounted for 20%, 9% and 8% of our total net revenues, respectively. Sales to Citrix accounted for 23%, 10% and 0% of our fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 total net revenues, respectively. A significant reduction in sales to either customer, or significant pricing and additional margin pressures exerted on us by either customer, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if either customer delays or cancels purchases of our products, our operating results would be harmed and our ability to accurately predict revenues, profitability and cash flows would decrease. In addition, we are dependent on the computer and networks, telecommunications, medical and imaging industries for a significant portion of our revenues. Our revenues are directly dependent on the level of capital spending for technology in the U.S. and international economies. If spending for technology declines in any of these industries over an extended period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success in business strategy is dependent upon our ability to generate significant revenues from world leading OEMs and ISVs development relationships. We believe we must continue to diversify our revenues, and a major component of our business strategy is to form product and services development relationships with world leading OEMs and ISVs. We market our customized services and products to specific customers and niche industries. This reduces competition from larger CMs because of the costs involved for them to run the smaller manufacturing volumes typical of these orders. The level of engineering complexity and after the sale service and support on some products reduce competition for VARs of all levels of size and geographic coverage. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other competitors through the strength of our close relationships with our very large OEM partners (Sun, Intel, AMD, HP and others), our ability to offer and deliver complete turnkey solutions in relatively short development cycles, our unique product set and our full service after the sale offering. Our future success will depend on our ability to establish relationships with new customers, as well as expanding sales to our existing customers. If we are unable to expand our sales to existing customers and develop relationships with new customers, our revenues and operating results could suffer. If we are unable to grow our international revenues and successfully overcome the risks inherent in international business activities, the growth of our business may be limited. The Companys ability to grow will depend in part on the growth of its international revenues. If our professional services around the development, deployment and support of sophisticated computer systems are not accepted across international regions, our ability to increase our revenues in this region would be limited. In addition, our international sales are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including: cost of customizing products for foreign countries; export and import restrictions, such as those affecting encryption commodities and software or those requiring local content; difficulties in providing customer support; reduced protection of intellectual property rights and increased liability exposure; regional economic and political conditions; and unique product requirements of certain foreign countries which may limit sales and or require significant additional research and development investments. The majority of our international sales currently are U.S. dollar denominated. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products less competitive in international markets. Because of this our revenues may be adversely affected, or we may be required to denominate more of our sales in foreign currencies at some point in the future to remain competitive. In addition, because certain of our operating expenses related to our international sales are denominated in foreign currency, we may have difficulty controlling expenses in the event of significant currency fluctuations. 6 Table of Contents If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements, including those related to: revenue recognition inventory write downs accounts receivable collections termination accruals income tax accruals stock based compensation; and warranty reserves. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate which could cause our results from operations to fall below expectations and thus impact the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. None of our customers are obligated to purchase any quantity of our products in the future nor are they obligated to meet forecasts of their product needs. Our operating expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and gross profits, which are partially dependent on our customers ability to accurately forecast and communicate their future product needs. If revenues or gross profits in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, operating results could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline. Factors affecting quarterly operating results include: the timing and size of orders from customers, particularly our largest customers; the product mix of our sales; the timing of new product introductions by our OEM customers; the availability and or price of products from suppliers; the loss of key suppliers or customers; price competition; Competition in professional services around the development, deployment and support of sophisticated computer systems market is significant and if we fail to compete effectively, our financial results will suffer. In the market of custom engineered computer system products, we face significant competition from a number of different types of sources. Our competition includes: (1) other CMs that provide similar engineering and manufacturing services, (2) other VARs and (3) less expensive off the shelf products. Many of these companies are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do, as well as significant distribution capabilities and larger, more established service organizations to support their products. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their existing resources, including their extensive distribution capabilities and service organizations, to provide a wider offering of products and services and higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can. If we fail to compete successfully in this market, the demand for our product and services would decrease. Customers make buying decisions based on many factors, including among other things, product performance and quality; availability and quality of support and other services; price; interoperability; ease of doing business; a vendors ability to adapt to customers changing requirements; responsiveness; contractual terms and conditions; vendor reputation and vendor viability. As competition increases, each factor on which we compete becomes more important and the lack of competitive advantage with respect to one or more of these factors could lead to a loss of competitive position, resulting in fewer customer orders, reduced revenues, reduced margins, reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share. These competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 7 Table of Contents Reliance on a single source supplier could delay product shipments and increase our costs. We depend on many suppliers for the necessary parts and components to manufacture and repair products. There are a number of vendors producing the parts and component that we need. However during fiscal year 2006, we purchased approximately 13% of all inventory directly from Sun or through Suns distribution channel. We believe all critical production components and service parts, or suitable substitutes, are readily available in the marketplace from multiple manufacturers and or suppliers, new or refurbished, as required by our current customers demands. If we were unable to purchase on acceptable terms or experienced significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts and or components from a particular vendor and we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components, our new and existing product or repair shipments could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our products may have quality issues that could adversely affect our sales and reputation. In the course of conducting our business, we experience and address quality issues. Some of our products and repairs contain defects, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third party components included in repair or product builds, which may be beyond our control. Often defects are identified during our design, development and manufacturing processes and we are able to correct many of these. When a quality issue is identified, we work extensively with our customers to remedy such issues. We may test the affected product to determine the root cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. If we are unable to determine the root cause or find an appropriate solution, we may delay shipment to customers. Defects in our repair or product builds can harm our reputation, delay or prevent sales, result in significant expense and could materially and adversely affect our business. If we fail to attract and retain appropriate levels of qualified employees and members of senior management, we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering, sales, customer service, and managerial personnel. If we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel, particularly personnel knowledgeable in software engineering and product management, we may not be able to meet key objectives such as developing, upgrading, or producing our repair and product builds in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business and could hinder any future growth. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a negative market reaction. Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting starting in 2008 with managements report on internal controls required for the 2007 fiscal year. We are in the process of establishing a program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. As a result, we will incur increased expense and will devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. If the site of our production and service operations were to experience a significant disruption in its operations, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our production and service facilities and headquarters are located in two buildings within two miles of each other. If the operations in either facility were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage or other similar event, our business could be seriously harmed as a result of interruptions or delays in our manufacturing, engineering, services or other post sales support operations. 8 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We lease approximately 113,000 square feet of office, warehouse, laboratory, and production space in a building located at 6600 Port Road, Groveport, Ohio. We entered into a ten year lease commencing May 1, 1999. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years. In addition, the Company leased an additional 51,609 square feet of warehouse and production space in a building located at 6295 Commerce Center Drive, Groveport, Ohio, within two miles of our other Groveport facility. This three year lease will expire on October 31, 2009. We also lease approximately 56,000 square feet of office, warehouse, laboratory and production space in a building located at 555 E. Huntington Drive, Monrovia, California. We assumed a five year lease on this property with our acquisition of the assets of GNP Computers, Inc. The lease terminates on January 31, 2010. This property was vacated, with no production as of September 30, 2006. We still maintain some offices and a small laboratory in this facility today. The Company has sales offices in Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Groveport, Ohio; Monrovia, California; San Francisco, California; Tiel, The Netherlands and Singapore. The Companys facilities are well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted. The productive capacity of our plants is adequate for the current requirements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings In September 2005, Syntegra (USA), Inc. filed a complaint against the Company and against one of our customers, Silicon Graphics, Inc., in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. Syntegra alleged that Silicon Graphics, who is also a former customer of Syntegra, misappropriated certain trade secrets of Syntegra, and that we unfairly benefited from the alleged misappropriation through the Companys relationship with Silicon Graphics. Syntegra, also asserted certain contract claims against Silicon Graphics. In September 2006, the Company and Silicon Graphics executed an Assumption and Cure Agreement for services to be performed, as Silicon Graphics emerged from a reorganization plan, filing a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a part of the Assumption and Cure Agreement, the Company was reimbursed for all out of pocket expenses incurred with the defense of the Syntegra claim. In December 2006, the claim against the Company and Silicon Graphics was dismissed with prejudice. There is no further exposure to the Company with this claim. From time to time, PDSi becomes involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. None of the pending litigation, individually or collectively, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders No matters were submitted to a vote of shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2006. 9 Table of Contents PART II Item 5.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes contained herein. This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the following sections, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the Company achieving its financial growth and profitability goals, or its sales, earnings and profitability expectations for fiscal year 2007. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, should, intend, plan, seek, may, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements that speak only as of the date thereof. Investors are cautioned that such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results due to many factors. These factors include changes in general economic conditions, changes in the specific markets for our products and services, adverse business conditions, changes in customer order patterns, increased competition, changes in our business or our relationship with major technology partners or significant customers, pricing pressures, lack of adequate financing to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, lack of success in technological advancements, risks associated with our new business practices, processes and information systems, and other factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A. of this report. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The Company provides professional services around the development, deployment, and support of sophisticated computer systems that are, or are in, the products of the Companys customer base that includes world leading OEM and ISV customers in the computer and network, imaging, medical, telecommunications, and aerospace equipment industries, among others. The Company offers a full range of engineering, product development, project and program management, integration, manufacturing, and lifecycle support services designed to increase its customers products speed to market and engineered product life while decreasing overall costs to develop, deploy, and service their products. The Companys business strategy is to collaborate with world leading OEMs and ISVs by managing the critical business activities required to successfully deploy information technology (IT) solutions. The Companys approach includes redefining the outsourced IT solution through offering comprehensive, global, and information laden solutions to fill critical supply chain, engineering, and logistics needs to OEMs that embed information technologies in products and to ISVs who distribute their software on information technology hardware. On August 15, 2005, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of GNP Computers, Inc. (the 2005 acquisition or GNP). The assets totaled approximately $8.7 million, of which $8.3 million was receivables and inventory. The liabilities assumed upon the acquisition consisted of a $2.3 million asset based line of credit, payables, and other accrued liabilities of approximately $6.4 million, which included the transaction fees for both parties. Simultaneously with the 2005 acquisition, the Company paid off the asset based line of credit. On August 9, 2005, in order to support the acquired business, the Company increased the asset based line of credit with KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) to $11 million from $6 million. The market value of the assets was essentially equal to the value of the assumed liabilities and capitalized transaction expenses. As a result, no goodwill was recorded on the transaction and no long term debt was assumed or incurred. The results of the operations of the GNP operation subsequent to August 15, 2005 are included in the Companys Statements of Operations. On June 2, 2006, the Company announced an operational improvement plan (the Plan) to upgrade its headquarters facility in Groveport, Ohio, open a warehouse and logistics facility in Groveport, Ohio, and consolidate the Companys Monrovia, California operations into the Groveport, Ohio facilities. The Company has invested approximately $0.4 million in 2006 to increase and improve its production, warehouse, and logistics capabilities in Ohio. In 2006, the Company incurred $1.6 million in costs associated with executing the Plan and consolidating its production in Groveport, Ohio. The costs included $0.2 million for termination and severance benefits for associates, an accrual of $1.2 million for the estimated outstanding lease costs for the facility in Monrovia, California that provides no future economic benefit to the Company, and $0.2 million for other closure costs including travel, training, and relocation of associates and production lines. The timing of finding a tenant, or multiple tenants, and vacating the Monrovia facility could alter the estimated lease contract termination costs. Additional lease termination costs for the Companys pro rata share of broker fees and tenant improvements, net of rent adjustments, may create additional charges in future periods, which cannot be estimated at this time. 13 Table of Contents As a result of the Plan, the Company is working towards gaining efficiencies in its operational areas that the Company believes will result in favorable operating results. The Company continues to address its scalability needs to meet customer requirements and to achieve profitable sales growth. In addition, the Company is evaluating and challenging existing business that consistently performs below expected results and is taking a more strategic approach to new opportunities. The Company is focused on opportunities where the customer recognizes and values the Company as a partner and enabler to the customers specialized product and services needs. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate viable acquisition opportunities that meet the Companys established criteria, which include strategic fit, complementary, additive, or synergistic to the Companys business, and projected accretive performance within less than a year. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATING RESULTS The following discusses and analyzes the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 (2006), December 31, 2005 (2005), and December 31, 2004 (2004). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Item 8 Financial Statement s and Supplementary Data. SALES Sales by segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Total sales $ 75,920 $ 44,606 $ 34,397 Product $ 65,344 $ 34,444 $ 28,351 Services $ 10,576 $ 10,162 $ 6,046 Sales for 2006 were $75.9 million compared to $44.6 million in 2005, an increase of 70%. The product sales totaled $65.3 million in 2006 compared to $34.4 million in 2005, an increase of 90%. The services sales totaled $10.6 million in 2006 compared to $10.2 million in 2005, an increase of 4%. The significantly higher 2006 sales compared to 2005 were due to solid organic growth in programs with existing customers coupled with the business acquired with the 2005 acquisition. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased production and shipments in substantially all customer markets, including medical, telecommunications, computer and imaging. During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced an unusually high level of orders from our two largest customers, Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Citrix Systems, Inc. (Citrix), which accounted for 58% of our fourth quarter revenues and 43% of our 2006 revenues. The high level of product sales from Citrix in 2006 was at a margin too low for the Company to accept in the future. Therefore, the Companys revenues from Citrix in 2007 will be lower. The increase in sales from 2004 to 2005 was $10.2 million, or an increase of 30%. The product sales increased $6.1 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 21%. The increase in product sales was due to increased shipments to medical, telecommunications and defense customers, which more than offset lower shipments to imaging and industrial control customers. The service sales increased $4.1 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 68%. The increase in service sales, primarily test and repair services, resulted from the 2005 acquisition. Both segments increased in sales from organic growth in the second half of 2005. The Company anticipates sales in first half of 2007 to be comparable to the first half of 2006. In 2006, we had three customers that generated revenues of approximately $17.4 million, $15.0 million, and $5.9 million or 23%, 20%, and 8% respectively, of total revenues. In the statements of operations, approximately 2% of the revenues from these customers were included in service sales and 98% were included in product sales. In addition, these customers represented 24%, 33%, and 8%, respectively, of accounts receivable at December 31, 2006. While the Company continues to seek new opportunities with existing customers, it anticipates growth from new customers, including international customers, leading to additional customer diversification over time. 14 Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT Gross profits for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Total gross profit $ 14,317 $ 10,547 $ 8,015 Product $ 8,761 $ 4,289 $ 5,698 Services $ 5,556 $ 6,258 $ 2,317 The gross profit margin percentage for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Total gross profit 19 % 24 % 23 % Product 13 % 12 % 20 % Services 53 % 62 % 38 % The gross profit in 2006 was $14.3 million compared to $10.5 million in 2005, an increase of 36%. The product gross profit totaled $8.8 million in 2006 compared to $4.3 million in 2005, an increase of 104%. The services gross profit totaled $5.6 million in 2006 compared to $6.3 million in 2005, a decrease of 11%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to 19% in 2006 from 24% in 2005. This decline is due, in part, to inefficiencies caused by the transition of production from the Monrovia facility to Groveport, start up of major new programs, completing lower margin product business, higher costs associated with producing record shipments, and change in mix of products produced and services provided. Services gross profit margins are consistently higher than product gross profit margins. As the mix of revenues has become more concentrated with product revenues, the overall gross margin has declined. Overall, service gross profit margins declined from 2005 to 2006 as the Company experienced a higher than usual margin on services delivered in the latter half of 2005. In addition, the decline in gross profit was due to incremental costs associated with redesigning the Groveport facilities for improved scalability, establishing a new logistics hub facility in Groveport, higher volume of non recurring engineering services, as well as the write off of certain inventories. The increase in gross profit from 2004 to 2005 was $2.5 million, or an increase of 32%. The product gross profit decreased by $1.4 million from 2004 to 2005, or a decrease of 25%. The services gross profit increased by $3.9 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 170%. The decrease in gross profit dollars and percentage on product sales in 2005 was due to sales mix as we implemented first time programs with large medical, imaging and network equipment customers during the year. The volume in these programs and the resulting increases in operating efficiency and gross profit contribute significantly to bottom line profitability. The increase in the gross profit dollars and percentage for service sales in 2005 was attributable to the organic growth in service sales as well as the addition of acquired customer programs. Gross margins will vary from program to program, and the mix of programs will vary from quarter to quarter causing the gross margin percentages to vary from quarter to quarter. Consequently, it is difficult to predict gross margin results for future revenues. As the Company continues to focus on its operational improvements and efficiencies, the Company expects gross margins to improve. OPERATING AND INTEREST EXPENSES Operating expenses, which include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and interest expense, for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Operating expenses $ 16,661 $ 8,739 $ 6,616 Interest expenses 800 289 113 Total expense $ 17,461 $ 9,028 $ 6,729 15 Table of Contents Operating expenses in 2006 were $17.5 million compared to $9.0 million in 2005, an increase of 93%. The increase in operating expenses was due to a full year of operating expenses from the 2005 acquisition compared to approximately four months in 2005. In addition, operating expenses were affected by special one time charges in the amount of $2.2 million in 2006, as described below. On May 8, 2006, Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) announced that it had reached an agreement with all of its Senior Secured bank lenders and with holders of a significant amount of its Senior Secured debt on the terms of a reorganization plan, filing voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During the second quarter, the Company determined that a portion of the outstanding accounts receivable balance may be uncollectible, and recorded a reserve against SGIs outstanding accounts receivables. On September 6, 2006, the Company executed an Assumption and Cure Agreement with SGI whereby SGI paid the Company 70% of the Companys pre petition claims on outstanding receivables, or $0.4 million. In total, the Company recorded a net charge of $0.2 million against the SGI outstanding receivables in 2006. In addition, the Company recorded $1.6 million in 2006 for costs associated with the Plan. The costs included $0.2 million for termination and severance benefits for associates, an accrual of $1.2 million for the estimated outstanding lease costs for the facility in Monrovia, California that provides no future economic benefit to the Company, and $0.2 million for other closure costs including travel, training, and relocation of associates and production lines. The timing of finding a tenant, or multiple tenants, and vacating the Monrovia facility could alter the estimated lease contract termination costs. Additional lease termination costs for the Companys pro rata share of broker fees and tenant improvements, net of rent adjustments, may create additional charges in future periods, which cannot be estimated at this time. In addition in 2006, SG&A expenses included one time charges of approximately $0.4 million for severance expenses, primarily related to the resignation of the Companys former President and Chief Operating Officer. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales 2006 and 2005 were 22% and 20%, respectively. On a pro forma basis excluding the special items noted above, totaling $2.2 million for 2006, SG&A expenses were $14.5 million, or 19% of sales. The increase in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due to the use of the Companys line of credit (the Line) and the addition of a short term note to finance the assets and liabilities of the 2005 acquisition, the additional operating cash flow requirements of additional business in 2006, and rising interest rates. The increase in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due to higher levels of receivables and inventory related to the 2005 acquisition and higher interest rates. The average daily balance on the Line and short term note was $10.0 million, $4.4 million, and $2.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Interest rates paid on the debt ranged from 7.25% to 8.25% in 2006, from 5.25% to 7.25% in 2005, and from 4.00% to 5.25% in 2004. With the growth attributed to the 2005 acquisition and through additional organic growth, the Company expects interest expense will be higher in the future as the Line and short term note are used to support the additional business opportunities. The increase in operating expense from 2004 to 2005 was $2.3 million, or an increase of 34%. A 32% increase in SG&A expenses in 2005 resulted primarily from the acquired operations along with planned increases in sales and marketing activities. The increase in SG&A expenses was comparable to the 30% increase in sales. SG&A expenses were 20% of sales in 2005, compared to 19% in 2004. INCOME TAXES (BENEFIT) EXPENSE AND NET (LOSS) INCOME The effective tax rates used for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were (41%), 38%, and 31%, respectively. Included in the tax benefit in 2006 was the tax affect of approximately $2.9 million of accumulated net operating loss that the Company expects to utilize as a carry back to 2005 and 2004 and receive tax refunds. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 reflected a decrease in foreign sales that had provided an extra territorial income tax incentive. 16 Table of Contents (Loss) income before taxes, income taxes (benefit) expense, and net (loss) income for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 (Loss) income before taxes $ (3,144 ) $ 1,519 $ 1,286 Income tax (benefit) expense (1,282 ) 582 402 Net (loss) income $ (1,862 ) $ 937 $ 884 (Loss) earnings per share for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Basic (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.30 ) $ 0.16 $ 0.16 Diluted (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.30 ) $ 0.15 $ 0.14 Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 6,252,209 5,867,986 5,572,811 Diluted 6,252,209 6,284,439 6,121,675 The earnings per share for the periods noted were affected by the items discussed elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. In 2006, although the Company had sales growth due to solid organic growth in programs with existing customers coupled with the business acquired with the 2005 acquisition, the Company incurred additional costs associated with the Plan, start up inefficiencies in the operational areas, and other one time charges. The Company continues to address its scalability needs to meet customer requirements and to achieve profitable sales growth. As a result of the Plan, the Company is working towards gaining efficiencies in its operational areas that will result in favorable operating results. In addition, the Company is evaluating and challenging existing businesses that consistently perform below expected results and is taking a more strategic approach to new opportunities. The Company is focused on opportunities where the customer recognizes and values the Company as a partner and enabler to the customers specialized product and services needs. The increase in net income from 2004 to 2005 was due to an increase in service sales, primarily due to the acquired service operations and due to organic growth. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES A summary of current assets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 Accounts receivable $ 17,718 $ 12,556 Inventory 11,732 9,233 Other current assets 2,429 1,740 Total current assets $ 31,879 $ 23,529 A summary of current liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 Line of credit $ 9,109 $ 9,336 Short term note 4,000 Accounts payable 11,851 6,122 Other current liabilities 2,204 2,206 Total current liabilities $ 27,164 $ 17,664 17 Table of Contents Net cash used in operating activities were $4.3 million, $4.8 million, and $0.1 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net (loss) income in 2006, 2005 and 2004 as adjusted for the effects of the non cash items, which primarily include depreciation expense, stock based compensation expense, accounts receivable reserves, inventory reserves, and provision for deferred taxes, used cash in operations of $2.1 million in 2006 and provided cash in operating activities of $1.3 million and $1.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Change in the working capital components required a net cash outlay of $2.1 million, $6.1 million, and $1.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, cash outlay was affected by the net loss generated for the year combined with the increased levels of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable caused by the growth in revenues and production in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys use of cash in investing activities was for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment and leasehold improvements in 2006, and computer equipment and software in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the Company assumed $0.1 million cash in the 2005 acquisition. In 2007, the Company plans to re engage the implementation of their ERP LN systems initiative and plans to have it fully implemented by the end of the year. The estimated cost of the system initiative is $1.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.7 million, $5.4 million, and $0.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, net cash provided by financing activities primarily included proceeds from the short term note of $4.0 million, as described below, and $0.7 million from the exercise of stock options. In 2005, the net cash provided by financing activities was used to support the 2005 acquisition and the increased business opportunities it provided. The Company is a borrower under a revolving credit promissory note (the Line) dated November 19, 2003, as amended, by and between the Company and KeyBank. On September 29, 2006, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to Loan Agreement and Allonge to Revolving Credit Promissory Note (the Amendment) with KeyBank. The Amendment extended the maturity date of the Line to May 15, 2008 (previously such maturity date was May 15, 2007) and adjusted certain financial covenants. The Line provides a maximum line of credit of $11.0 million, subject to borrowing base restrictions. The borrowing base is determined as the lesser of 1) $11.0 million or 2) the sum of (a) 85% of the aggregate amount of eligible receivable accounts, plus (b) 50% of the aggregate amount of eligible inventory, not to exceed the lesser of $7.5 million or 50% of the then outstanding principal balance of all loans, (c) minus the principal balance of the Term Note (as defined below). In addition, the agreement restricts the payments of cash dividends that would cause violations of the loan covenants. The Line is payable on demand and is collateralized by a blanket lien on all assets of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum available borrowing base was $11.0 million, with unused capacity of $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance on the Line was $9.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The average debt balance in 2006 was $10.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Line bears interest monthly at an annual rate equal to prime rate or the overnight LIBOR plus 2.45%. The borrowing rate on the Line was 7.7625% and 7.25% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted average interest rate for 2006 was 7.94%, with the interest rate ranging from 7.25% to 8.25%. In addition, the unused Line capacity is subject to a commitment fee of 1/8%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Line is subject to certain financial covenants, including a total debt to tangible net worth and the operating cash flow to total fixed charge ratio. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was not in compliance with these two financial covenants. KeyBank granted a waiver of the covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the Amendment to the Line, the Company entered into a term loan with KeyBank, in the principal amount of $4.0 million, as evidenced by a promissory note dated September 28, 2006 (the Term Note). The principal amount of the Term Note will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 0.25%. The borrowing rate on the Term Note was 8.0% on December 31, 2006. The Term Note has a maturity date of May 15, 2007. The Term Note is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, as provided for in the Commercial Security Agreement entered into between the Company and KeyBank on September 29, 2006. The proceeds were used to pay the $2.0 million short term note entered into on June 23, 2006 and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line, thereby increasing the Lines availability to fund working capital needs. The Company is working with KeyBank on extending the Term Note, or creating an alternative financing vehicle. The Companys ability to meet the terms and covenants of the Line and Term Note will be dependent upon the Companys future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial operations. There can be no assurance that the Companys future performance will not be affected negatively by changes in the above factors to such a degree that it affects the Companys ability to meet the terms and covenants of the Line and Term Note. 18 Table of Contents Additional financing may be required to support the future growth plans of the Company. The future growth plans of the Company include an acquisition strategy that may include acquiring companies that are in a similar or complementary business as the Company. The Companys acquisition strategy may be financed by the issuance of additional common or preferred stock that has been previously authorized by the shareholders. The issuance of these noted shares require the approval of the Board of Directors. The Company is evaluating acquisition targets based on similar or complementary services as currently provided by the Company that will be accretive within one year thereafter. The acquisition targets may provide large OEM customer relationships that have a potential for additional business through the synergies of the combined company (which may not be attainable by either company on their own); and or bring resources, in terms of people, processes and or systems, that increase the scalability of the combined businesses. In November 2006, the Company announced an intention to acquire Aspan Computer Repair Laboratories B.V., located near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, under a non binding letter of intent. As of the date of this Form 10 K, the Company has not completed this acquisition and will not likely complete it before the expiration of the current letter of intent. Management of the Company is actively negotiating new terms for this transaction with the owner and plans to have a transaction completed by the end of 2007. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company leases operating and sales facilities under various operating leases that expire between 2007 and 2010. The leases contain annual escalators intended to cover inflationary costs over the life of the leases. The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain key executives. Such agreements provide for annual salaries, bonuses and severances, and include non compete and non solicitation provisions. The following table lists the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: ($ in thousands) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years Revolving credit obligations (1) $ 10,179 $ 10,179 $ $ $ Term loan (1) 4,118 4,118 Operating lease obligations 5,766 2,088 3,584 94 Purchase obligations 7,119 7,119 Total $ 27,182 $ 23,504 $ 3,584 $ 94 $ (1) Includes estimated interest expense using the 2006 end of year interest rate and the maturity dates of the respective debts. The principal balance used in the calculation was the 2006 average debt balance for the revolving credit obligation and the outstanding principal balance for the Term loan. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements with any obligation under a guarantee contract, or a retained or contingent interest in assets or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets, or any other obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or arising out of a variable interest. At any given point in time in the normal course of business, the Company has numerous outstanding purchase orders with vendors to purchase inventory for use in the products that are sold to the Companys customers or are used in performing repair services for the Companys customers. Such orders are not recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet until the material is placed on a common carrier or delivered to the Companys facilities, depending on terms of the arrangement. The Company has no minimum purchase quantity requirements with any of its vendors. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on our Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 19 Table of Contents preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies, as applicable. The methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments are set forth below: Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses are carried at cost as this approximates fair value due to their short term nature. Line of credit and short term notes have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, delivery has occurred and title, ownership, and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For product sales, this occurs upon transference of title to the customer. For repair sales, this occurs upon completion of the repair work and the item is either returned to the customer, or returned to a customer owned inventory location in the Companys warehouse in accordance with repair programs. For certain repair and maintenance programs, the customer pays a flat fee that covers multiple periods. The Company recognizes revenue on a pro rata basis over the service period. For inventory and logistics management program, revenue is recognized in the month in which the services are provided. For non recurring engineering projects, the Company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the collectibility of the accounts receivable and provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances, historical write off experience and an on going review of the Companys trade customers and their ability to make payment. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventory and Respective Reserves The carrying values of component parts and finished goods represent average cost or managements estimate of its net realizable value. Such value is based on forecasts of product orders and repair/trade in activity in the ensuing years. Such forecasts are based on historical information, known contracts, and managements expertise in computer hardware life cycles. If demand for the Companys products and repair/trade in hardware prove to be significantly less than anticipated, the ultimate realizable value of such products could be substantially less than the amount shown in the balance sheet. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the respective assets. Furniture and fixtures, computer equipment and related software, and shop equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of useful life or remaining lease term. Technology licenses are amortized over their terms. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reported in the statement of operations. Normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. The Company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company will recognize an impairment loss whenever evidence exists that the carrying value is not recoverable. Product Warranty The Company provides a limited warranty for defects in material or workmanship on the Companys products and repair services. The warranty periods generally range from one to two years, and involve repairing or replacing any defective component returned within the warranty period. The warranty is limited to the original customer. The historical warranty cost of material has been nominal, as most components used in the Companys products have warranties with the component suppliers. 20 Table of Contents Plant Consolidation Costs The Company recognizes costs associated with the plant consolidation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). The liability and expense for costs associated with the consolidation was recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability was incurred. The one time termination benefits for the terminated associates were ratably expensed over the remaining service period of the associates. The estimated outstanding lease costs on the abandoned facility, which has no future economic benefit to the Company, was recognized and measured at its fair value in the period the Company ceased to use the facility for its intended use. In periods subsequent to the initial estimate of the lease costs on the abandoned facility, changes in the assumptions used to calculate the liability are evaluated and adjustments to the liability are recognized in the period of change. Stock Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company used the intrinsic value based method to record compensation costs related to share based payment transactions. The Company did not recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to its employees and non employee directors that had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant in its statement of operations prior to January 1, 2006. The Company recognizes the cost of these awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised), Shared Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), and related interpretations using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, the Company expenses the compensation cost for stock based awards granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006 over the stock options vesting period, and have valued them based on fair value at the grant date as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effect of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP). The FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R) or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. The Company elected to follow the transition guidance in SFAS No. 123(R), and recognized a deferred tax asset in 2006 of $333,000 on compensation expense that the Company would have deducted for any nonqualified incentive stock options at the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The offset is an increase to the additional paid in capital. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 becomes effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, (SFAS No. 157), effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB No. 108), which expresses the staffs views regarding the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. The SEC staff issued SAB No. 108 to address the diversity in practice in quantifying material financial statement misstatements and the potential, under current practice, for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The effective date of SAB 108 is for fiscal years ending on or before November 15, 2006. This pronouncement did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 (SFAS No. 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. 21 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company does not engage in commodity trading activities and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The Company also does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies that would expose itself to additional market risk. In the normal course of business, the Companys operations are exposed to interest rate risk. The primary interest rate risk exposure relates to (i) the ability to refinance the line of credit at market rates, and (ii) the impact of interest rate movements on the ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants under the Companys debt instruments. As a borrower under the Line and Term Note, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates. The outstanding balance on the Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to prime rate or the overnight LIBOR plus 2.45%. The borrowing rate on the Line was 7.7625% at December 31, 2006. A 1% increase in interest rate may cause an additional $0.1 million in annual expense on the total available Line of $11.0 million. The principal amount on the Term Note of $4.0 million bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 0.25%. A 1% increase in interest rate may cause less than $0.1 million in annual expense on the Term Note. The Company believes that the effect of changes in interest rates will not adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Companys market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material. Through 2006, the Company had minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. 22 Table of Contents

The Company offers a full range of engineering, product development, project and program management, integration, manufacturing, and lifecycle support services designed to increase its customers products speed to market and engineered product life while decreasing overall costs to develop, deploy, and service their products. The Companys business strategy is to collaborate with world leading OEMs and ISVs by managing the critical business activities required to successfully deploy information technology (IT) solutions. The Companys approach includes redefining the outsourced IT solution through offering comprehensive, global, and information laden solutions to fill critical supply chain, engineering, and logistics needs to OEMs that embed information technologies in products and to ISVs who distribute their software on information technology hardware. On August 15, 2005, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of GNP Computers, Inc. (the 2005 acquisition or GNP). The assets totaled approximately $8.7 million, of which $8.3 million was receivables and inventory. The liabilities assumed upon the acquisition consisted of a $2.3 million asset based line of credit, payables, and other accrued liabilities of approximately $6.4 million, which included the transaction fees for both parties. Simultaneously with the 2005 acquisition, the Company paid off the asset based line of credit. On August 9, 2005, in order to support the acquired business, the Company increased the asset based line of credit with KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) to $11 million from $6 million. The market value of the assets was essentially equal to the value of the assumed liabilities and capitalized transaction expenses. As a result, no goodwill was recorded on the transaction and no long term debt was assumed or incurred. The results of the operations of the GNP operation subsequent to August 15, 2005 are included in the Companys Statements of Operations. On June 2, 2006, the Company announced an operational improvement plan (the Plan) to upgrade its headquarters facility in Groveport, Ohio, open a warehouse and logistics facility in Groveport, Ohio, and consolidate the Companys Monrovia, California operations into the Groveport, Ohio facilities. The Company has invested approximately $0.4 million in 2006 to increase and improve its production, warehouse, and logistics capabilities in Ohio. In 2006, the Company incurred $1.6 million in costs associated with executing the Plan and consolidating its production in Groveport, Ohio. The costs included $0.2 million for termination and severance benefits for associates, an accrual of $1.2 million for the estimated outstanding lease costs for the facility in Monrovia, California that provides no future economic benefit to the Company, and $0.2 million for other closure costs including travel, training, and relocation of associates and production lines. The timing of finding a tenant, or multiple tenants, and vacating the Monrovia facility could alter the estimated lease contract termination costs. Additional lease termination costs for the Companys pro rata share of broker fees and tenant improvements, net of rent adjustments, may create additional charges in future periods, which cannot be estimated at this time. 13 Table of Contents As a result of the Plan, the Company is working towards gaining efficiencies in its operational areas that the Company believes will result in favorable operating results. The Company continues to address its scalability needs to meet customer requirements and to achieve profitable sales growth. In addition, the Company is evaluating and challenging existing business that consistently performs below expected results and is taking a more strategic approach to new opportunities. The Company is focused on opportunities where the customer recognizes and values the Company as a partner and enabler to the customers specialized product and services needs. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate viable acquisition opportunities that meet the Companys established criteria, which include strategic fit, complementary, additive, or synergistic to the Companys business, and projected accretive performance within less than a year. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATING RESULTS The following discusses and analyzes the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 (2006), December 31, 2005 (2005), and December 31, 2004 (2004). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K in Item 8 Financial Statement s and Supplementary Data. SALES Sales by segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Total sales $ 75,920 $ 44,606 $ 34,397 Product $ 65,344 $ 34,444 $ 28,351 Services $ 10,576 $ 10,162 $ 6,046 Sales for 2006 were $75.9 million compared to $44.6 million in 2005, an increase of 70%. The product sales totaled $65.3 million in 2006 compared to $34.4 million in 2005, an increase of 90%. The services sales totaled $10.6 million in 2006 compared to $10.2 million in 2005, an increase of 4%. The significantly higher 2006 sales compared to 2005 were due to solid organic growth in programs with existing customers coupled with the business acquired with the 2005 acquisition. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased production and shipments in substantially all customer markets, including medical, telecommunications, computer and imaging. During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced an unusually high level of orders from our two largest customers, Sun Microsystems, Inc. and Citrix Systems, Inc. (Citrix), which accounted for 58% of our fourth quarter revenues and 43% of our 2006 revenues. The high level of product sales from Citrix in 2006 was at a margin too low for the Company to accept in the future. Therefore, the Companys revenues from Citrix in 2007 will be lower. The increase in sales from 2004 to 2005 was $10.2 million, or an increase of 30%. The product sales increased $6.1 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 21%. The increase in product sales was due to increased shipments to medical, telecommunications and defense customers, which more than offset lower shipments to imaging and industrial control customers. The service sales increased $4.1 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 68%. The increase in service sales, primarily test and repair services, resulted from the 2005 acquisition. Both segments increased in sales from organic growth in the second half of 2005. The Company anticipates sales in first half of 2007 to be comparable to the first half of 2006. In 2006, we had three customers that generated revenues of approximately $17.4 million, $15.0 million, and $5.9 million or 23%, 20%, and 8% respectively, of total revenues. In the statements of operations, approximately 2% of the revenues from these customers were included in service sales and 98% were included in product sales. In addition, these customers represented 24%, 33%, and 8%, respectively, of accounts receivable at December 31, 2006. While the Company continues to seek new opportunities with existing customers, it anticipates growth from new customers, including international customers, leading to additional customer diversification over time. 14 Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT Gross profits for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Total gross profit $ 14,317 $ 10,547 $ 8,015 Product $ 8,761 $ 4,289 $ 5,698 Services $ 5,556 $ 6,258 $ 2,317 The gross profit margin percentage for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Total gross profit 19 % 24 % 23 % Product 13 % 12 % 20 % Services 53 % 62 % 38 % The gross profit in 2006 was $14.3 million compared to $10.5 million in 2005, an increase of 36%. The product gross profit totaled $8.8 million in 2006 compared to $4.3 million in 2005, an increase of 104%. The services gross profit totaled $5.6 million in 2006 compared to $6.3 million in 2005, a decrease of 11%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to 19% in 2006 from 24% in 2005. This decline is due, in part, to inefficiencies caused by the transition of production from the Monrovia facility to Groveport, start up of major new programs, completing lower margin product business, higher costs associated with producing record shipments, and change in mix of products produced and services provided. Services gross profit margins are consistently higher than product gross profit margins. As the mix of revenues has become more concentrated with product revenues, the overall gross margin has declined. Overall, service gross profit margins declined from 2005 to 2006 as the Company experienced a higher than usual margin on services delivered in the latter half of 2005. In addition, the decline in gross profit was due to incremental costs associated with redesigning the Groveport facilities for improved scalability, establishing a new logistics hub facility in Groveport, higher volume of non recurring engineering services, as well as the write off of certain inventories. The increase in gross profit from 2004 to 2005 was $2.5 million, or an increase of 32%. The product gross profit decreased by $1.4 million from 2004 to 2005, or a decrease of 25%. The services gross profit increased by $3.9 million from 2004 to 2005, or an increase of 170%. The decrease in gross profit dollars and percentage on product sales in 2005 was due to sales mix as we implemented first time programs with large medical, imaging and network equipment customers during the year. The volume in these programs and the resulting increases in operating efficiency and gross profit contribute significantly to bottom line profitability. The increase in the gross profit dollars and percentage for service sales in 2005 was attributable to the organic growth in service sales as well as the addition of acquired customer programs. Gross margins will vary from program to program, and the mix of programs will vary from quarter to quarter causing the gross margin percentages to vary from quarter to quarter. Consequently, it is difficult to predict gross margin results for future revenues. As the Company continues to focus on its operational improvements and efficiencies, the Company expects gross margins to improve. OPERATING AND INTEREST EXPENSES Operating expenses, which include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and interest expense, for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Operating expenses $ 16,661 $ 8,739 $ 6,616 Interest expenses 800 289 113 Total expense $ 17,461 $ 9,028 $ 6,729 15 Table of Contents Operating expenses in 2006 were $17.5 million compared to $9.0 million in 2005, an increase of 93%. The increase in operating expenses was due to a full year of operating expenses from the 2005 acquisition compared to approximately four months in 2005. In addition, operating expenses were affected by special one time charges in the amount of $2.2 million in 2006, as described below. On May 8, 2006, Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) announced that it had reached an agreement with all of its Senior Secured bank lenders and with holders of a significant amount of its Senior Secured debt on the terms of a reorganization plan, filing voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During the second quarter, the Company determined that a portion of the outstanding accounts receivable balance may be uncollectible, and recorded a reserve against SGIs outstanding accounts receivables. On September 6, 2006, the Company executed an Assumption and Cure Agreement with SGI whereby SGI paid the Company 70% of the Companys pre petition claims on outstanding receivables, or $0.4 million. In total, the Company recorded a net charge of $0.2 million against the SGI outstanding receivables in 2006. In addition, the Company recorded $1.6 million in 2006 for costs associated with the Plan. The costs included $0.2 million for termination and severance benefits for associates, an accrual of $1.2 million for the estimated outstanding lease costs for the facility in Monrovia, California that provides no future economic benefit to the Company, and $0.2 million for other closure costs including travel, training, and relocation of associates and production lines. The timing of finding a tenant, or multiple tenants, and vacating the Monrovia facility could alter the estimated lease contract termination costs. Additional lease termination costs for the Companys pro rata share of broker fees and tenant improvements, net of rent adjustments, may create additional charges in future periods, which cannot be estimated at this time. In addition in 2006, SG&A expenses included one time charges of approximately $0.4 million for severance expenses, primarily related to the resignation of the Companys former President and Chief Operating Officer. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales 2006 and 2005 were 22% and 20%, respectively. On a pro forma basis excluding the special items noted above, totaling $2.2 million for 2006, SG&A expenses were $14.5 million, or 19% of sales. The increase in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was due to the use of the Companys line of credit (the Line) and the addition of a short term note to finance the assets and liabilities of the 2005 acquisition, the additional operating cash flow requirements of additional business in 2006, and rising interest rates. The increase in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was due to higher levels of receivables and inventory related to the 2005 acquisition and higher interest rates. The average daily balance on the Line and short term note was $10.0 million, $4.4 million, and $2.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Interest rates paid on the debt ranged from 7.25% to 8.25% in 2006, from 5.25% to 7.25% in 2005, and from 4.00% to 5.25% in 2004. With the growth attributed to the 2005 acquisition and through additional organic growth, the Company expects interest expense will be higher in the future as the Line and short term note are used to support the additional business opportunities. The increase in operating expense from 2004 to 2005 was $2.3 million, or an increase of 34%. A 32% increase in SG&A expenses in 2005 resulted primarily from the acquired operations along with planned increases in sales and marketing activities. The increase in SG&A expenses was comparable to the 30% increase in sales. SG&A expenses were 20% of sales in 2005, compared to 19% in 2004. INCOME TAXES (BENEFIT) EXPENSE AND NET (LOSS) INCOME The effective tax rates used for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were (41%), 38%, and 31%, respectively. Included in the tax benefit in 2006 was the tax affect of approximately $2.9 million of accumulated net operating loss that the Company expects to utilize as a carry back to 2005 and 2004 and receive tax refunds. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 reflected a decrease in foreign sales that had provided an extra territorial income tax incentive. 16 Table of Contents (Loss) income before taxes, income taxes (benefit) expense, and net (loss) income for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 (Loss) income before taxes $ (3,144 ) $ 1,519 $ 1,286 Income tax (benefit) expense (1,282 ) 582 402 Net (loss) income $ (1,862 ) $ 937 $ 884 (Loss) earnings per share for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Basic (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.30 ) $ 0.16 $ 0.16 Diluted (loss) earnings per common share $ (0.30 ) $ 0.15 $ 0.14 Weighted average number of shares outstanding: Basic 6,252,209 5,867,986 5,572,811 Diluted 6,252,209 6,284,439 6,121,675 The earnings per share for the periods noted were affected by the items discussed elsewhere in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. In 2006, although the Company had sales growth due to solid organic growth in programs with existing customers coupled with the business acquired with the 2005 acquisition, the Company incurred additional costs associated with the Plan, start up inefficiencies in the operational areas, and other one time charges. The Company continues to address its scalability needs to meet customer requirements and to achieve profitable sales growth. As a result of the Plan, the Company is working towards gaining efficiencies in its operational areas that will result in favorable operating results. In addition, the Company is evaluating and challenging existing businesses that consistently perform below expected results and is taking a more strategic approach to new opportunities. The Company is focused on opportunities where the customer recognizes and values the Company as a partner and enabler to the customers specialized product and services needs. The increase in net income from 2004 to 2005 was due to an increase in service sales, primarily due to the acquired service operations and due to organic growth. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES A summary of current assets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 Accounts receivable $ 17,718 $ 12,556 Inventory 11,732 9,233 Other current assets 2,429 1,740 Total current assets $ 31,879 $ 23,529 A summary of current liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: ($ in thousands) 2006 2005 Line of credit $ 9,109 $ 9,336 Short term note 4,000 Accounts payable 11,851 6,122 Other current liabilities 2,204 2,206 Total current liabilities $ 27,164 $ 17,664 17 Table of Contents Net cash used in operating activities were $4.3 million, $4.8 million, and $0.1 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net (loss) income in 2006, 2005 and 2004 as adjusted for the effects of the non cash items, which primarily include depreciation expense, stock based compensation expense, accounts receivable reserves, inventory reserves, and provision for deferred taxes, used cash in operations of $2.1 million in 2006 and provided cash in operating activities of $1.3 million and $1.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Change in the working capital components required a net cash outlay of $2.1 million, $6.1 million, and $1.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, cash outlay was affected by the net loss generated for the year combined with the increased levels of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable caused by the growth in revenues and production in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys use of cash in investing activities was for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment and leasehold improvements in 2006, and computer equipment and software in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the Company assumed $0.1 million cash in the 2005 acquisition. In 2007, the Company plans to re engage the implementation of their ERP LN systems initiative and plans to have it fully implemented by the end of the year. The estimated cost of the system initiative is $1.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.7 million, $5.4 million, and $0.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, net cash provided by financing activities primarily included proceeds from the short term note of $4.0 million, as described below, and $0.7 million from the exercise of stock options. In 2005, the net cash provided by financing activities was used to support the 2005 acquisition and the increased business opportunities it provided. The Company is a borrower under a revolving credit promissory note (the Line) dated November 19, 2003, as amended, by and between the Company and KeyBank. On September 29, 2006, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to Loan Agreement and Allonge to Revolving Credit Promissory Note (the Amendment) with KeyBank. The Amendment extended the maturity date of the Line to May 15, 2008 (previously such maturity date was May 15, 2007) and adjusted certain financial covenants. The Line provides a maximum line of credit of $11.0 million, subject to borrowing base restrictions. The borrowing base is determined as the lesser of 1) $11.0 million or 2) the sum of (a) 85% of the aggregate amount of eligible receivable accounts, plus (b) 50% of the aggregate amount of eligible inventory, not to exceed the lesser of $7.5 million or 50% of the then outstanding principal balance of all loans, (c) minus the principal balance of the Term Note (as defined below). In addition, the agreement restricts the payments of cash dividends that would cause violations of the loan covenants. The Line is payable on demand and is collateralized by a blanket lien on all assets of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum available borrowing base was $11.0 million, with unused capacity of $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance on the Line was $9.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The average debt balance in 2006 was $10.0 million. The outstanding balance on the Line bears interest monthly at an annual rate equal to prime rate or the overnight LIBOR plus 2.45%. The borrowing rate on the Line was 7.7625% and 7.25% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted average interest rate for 2006 was 7.94%, with the interest rate ranging from 7.25% to 8.25%. In addition, the unused Line capacity is subject to a commitment fee of 1/8%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Line is subject to certain financial covenants, including a total debt to tangible net worth and the operating cash flow to total fixed charge ratio. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was not in compliance with these two financial covenants. KeyBank granted a waiver of the covenants for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the Amendment to the Line, the Company entered into a term loan with KeyBank, in the principal amount of $4.0 million, as evidenced by a promissory note dated September 28, 2006 (the Term Note). The principal amount of the Term Note will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 0.25%. The borrowing rate on the Term Note was 8.0% on December 31, 2006. The Term Note has a maturity date of May 15, 2007. The Term Note is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, as provided for in the Commercial Security Agreement entered into between the Company and KeyBank on September 29, 2006. The proceeds were used to pay the $2.0 million short term note entered into on June 23, 2006 and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line, thereby increasing the Lines availability to fund working capital needs. The Company is working with KeyBank on extending the Term Note, or creating an alternative financing vehicle. The Companys ability to meet the terms and covenants of the Line and Term Note will be dependent upon the Companys future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial operations. There can be no assurance that the Companys future performance will not be affected negatively by changes in the above factors to such a degree that it affects the Companys ability to meet the terms and covenants of the Line and Term Note. 18 Table of Contents Additional financing may be required to support the future growth plans of the Company. The future growth plans of the Company include an acquisition strategy that may include acquiring companies that are in a similar or complementary business as the Company. The Companys acquisition strategy may be financed by the issuance of additional common or preferred stock that has been previously authorized by the shareholders. The issuance of these noted shares require the approval of the Board of Directors. The Company is evaluating acquisition targets based on similar or complementary services as currently provided by the Company that will be accretive within one year thereafter. The acquisition targets may provide large OEM customer relationships that have a potential for additional business through the synergies of the combined company (which may not be attainable by either company on their own); and or bring resources, in terms of people, processes and or systems, that increase the scalability of the combined businesses. In November 2006, the Company announced an intention to acquire Aspan Computer Repair Laboratories B.V., located near Amsterdam, The Netherlands, under a non binding letter of intent. As of the date of this Form 10 K, the Company has not completed this acquisition and will not likely complete it before the expiration of the current letter of intent. Management of the Company is actively negotiating new terms for this transaction with the owner and plans to have a transaction completed by the end of 2007. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company leases operating and sales facilities under various operating leases that expire between 2007 and 2010. The leases contain annual escalators intended to cover inflationary costs over the life of the leases. The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain key executives. Such agreements provide for annual salaries, bonuses and severances, and include non compete and non solicitation provisions. The following table lists the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: ($ in thousands) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than5 Years Revolving credit obligations (1) $ 10,179 $ 10,179 $ $ $ Term loan (1) 4,118 4,118 Operating lease obligations 5,766 2,088 3,584 94 Purchase obligations 7,119 7,119 Total $ 27,182 $ 23,504 $ 3,584 $ 94 $ (1) Includes estimated interest expense using the 2006 end of year interest rate and the maturity dates of the respective debts. The principal balance used in the calculation was the 2006 average debt balance for the revolving credit obligation and the outstanding principal balance for the Term loan. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements with any obligation under a guarantee contract, or a retained or contingent interest in assets or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets, or any other obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or arising out of a variable interest. At any given point in time in the normal course of business, the Company has numerous outstanding purchase orders with vendors to purchase inventory for use in the products that are sold to the Companys customers or are used in performing repair services for the Companys customers. Such orders are not recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet until the material is placed on a common carrier or delivered to the Companys facilities, depending on terms of the arrangement. The Company has no minimum purchase quantity requirements with any of its vendors. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on our Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 19 Table of Contents preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies, as applicable. The methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments are set forth below: Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses are carried at cost as this approximates fair value due to their short term nature. Line of credit and short term notes have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, delivery has occurred and title, ownership, and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For product sales, this occurs upon transference of title to the customer. For repair sales, this occurs upon completion of the repair work and the item is either returned to the customer, or returned to a customer owned inventory location in the Companys warehouse in accordance with repair programs. For certain repair and maintenance programs, the customer pays a flat fee that covers multiple periods. The Company recognizes revenue on a pro rata basis over the service period. For inventory and logistics management program, revenue is recognized in the month in which the services are provided. For non recurring engineering projects, the Company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the collectibility of the accounts receivable and provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances, historical write off experience and an on going review of the Companys trade customers and their ability to make payment. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventory and Respective Reserves The carrying values of component parts and finished goods represent average cost or managements estimate of its net realizable value. Such value is based on forecasts of product orders and repair/trade in activity in the ensuing years. Such forecasts are based on historical information, known contracts, and managements expertise in computer hardware life cycles. If demand for the Companys products and repair/trade in hardware prove to be significantly less than anticipated, the ultimate realizable value of such products could be substantially less than the amount shown in the balance sheet. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the respective assets. Furniture and fixtures, computer equipment and related software, and shop equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of useful life or remaining lease term. Technology licenses are amortized over their terms. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reported in the statement of operations. Normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. The Company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company will recognize an impairment loss whenever evidence exists that the carrying value is not recoverable. Product Warranty The Company provides a limited warranty for defects in material or workmanship on the Companys products and repair services. The warranty periods generally range from one to two years, and involve repairing or replacing any defective component returned within the warranty period. The warranty is limited to the original customer. The historical warranty cost of material has been nominal, as most components used in the Companys products have warranties with the component suppliers. 20 Table of Contents Plant Consolidation Costs The Company recognizes costs associated with the plant consolidation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). The liability and expense for costs associated with the consolidation was recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability was incurred. The one time termination benefits for the terminated associates were ratably expensed over the remaining service period of the associates. The estimated outstanding lease costs on the abandoned facility, which has no future economic benefit to the Company, was recognized and measured at its fair value in the period the Company ceased to use the facility for its intended use. In periods subsequent to the initial estimate of the lease costs on the abandoned facility, changes in the assumptions used to calculate the liability are evaluated and adjustments to the liability are recognized in the period of change. Stock Based Compensation For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company used the intrinsic value based method to record compensation costs related to share based payment transactions. The Company did not recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to its employees and non employee directors that had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant in its statement of operations prior to January 1, 2006. The Company recognizes the cost of these awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised), Shared Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), and related interpretations using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, the Company expenses the compensation cost for stock based awards granted on or subsequent to January 1, 2006 over the stock options vesting period, and have valued them based on fair value at the grant date as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effect of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP). The FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R) or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. The Company elected to follow the transition guidance in SFAS No. 123(R), and recognized a deferred tax asset in 2006 of $333,000 on compensation expense that the Company would have deducted for any nonqualified incentive stock options at the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The offset is an increase to the additional paid in capital. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 becomes effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, (SFAS No. 157), effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB No. 108), which expresses the staffs views regarding the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. The SEC staff issued SAB No. 108 to address the diversity in practice in quantifying material financial statement misstatements and the potential, under current practice, for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The effective date of SAB 108 is for fiscal years ending on or before November 15, 2006. This pronouncement did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 (SFAS No. 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial statements. 21 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company does not engage in commodity trading activities and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The Company also does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies that would expose itself to additional market risk. In the normal course of business, the Companys operations are exposed to interest rate risk. The primary interest rate risk exposure relates to (i) the ability to refinance the line of credit at market rates, and (ii) the impact of interest rate movements on the ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants under the Companys debt instruments. As a borrower under the Line and Term Note, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates. The outstanding balance on the Line bears interest at an annual rate equal to prime rate or the overnight LIBOR plus 2.45%. The borrowing rate on the Line was 7.7625% at December 31, 2006. A 1% increase in interest rate may cause an additional $0.1 million in annual expense on the total available Line of $11.0 million. The principal amount on the Term Note of $4.0 million bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 0.25%. A 1% increase in interest rate may cause less than $0.1 million in annual expense on the Term Note. The Company believes that the effect of changes in interest rates will not adversely affect the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Companys market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material. Through 2006, the Company had minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. 22 Table of Contents
