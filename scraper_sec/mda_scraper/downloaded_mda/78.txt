ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW As a result of the Aviall acquisition, the Company is now the largest and most diversified independent gas turbine engine repair and overhaul company in the world. Under current managements direction, internal growth and strategic acquisitions have increased the Companys net sales from $62.0 million in 1992 to $397.9 million in 1996. Similarly, net income has increased from $2.5 million in 1992 to $11.8 million in 1996. The 1994 acquisition of Greenwich Connecticut assets and the 1996 acquisition of the Aviall Business have diversified further the Companys servicing capabilities, adding the Pratt & Whitney JT8D 200, PW 100 and GG4, the CFM International CFM56 series, the GE CF6 80, and the International Aero Engine V2500 engine lines to the Companys service lines. Furthermore, these acquisitions have increased market share and provided access to previously unavailable markets. Income from operations as a percentage of sales has declined from 12.5% in fiscal 1993 to 8.0% in fiscal 1996. This decline primarily resulted from the acquisitions of the Greenwich Connecticut and Aviall Business assets, both of which had significantly lower operating margins than the Company at the time of such acquisitions. Also impacting operating margins were competitive pricing pressures within the Companys markets and a greater proportion of revenues generated under long term contracts. These long term contracts historically carry lower margins but provide more predictable and steady streams of revenue. No assurance can be given however, that any or all of these agreements will be renewed or extended on terms which are commercially favorable to the Company. In such connection, the renewal of a significant long term agreement with USAir, which expired in October 1996, was awarded to GE, and another long term agreement with Southwest Airlines expiring in March 1997 is currently under competitive bid. The integration of these operations has generated, and is expected to continue generating, cost savings from productivity improvements and the elimination of duplicative overhead expenses. Management believes that these factors, coupled with the Companys entrepreneurial approach and commitment to remain a high quality, efficient provider of gas turbine engine services, will enable the Company to maintain its position as a successful competitor in the global marketplace. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 1996 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1995 Net sales for fiscal year 1996 increased 102.7% to $397.9 million, from $196.3 million for fiscal year 1995. This increase is attributable primarily to the operations of the former Aviall Business, which generated net sales of approximately $162.2 million since their acquisition on June 10, 1996. In addition, revenues from the Companys pre acquisition operations increased by approximately $39.4 million, or 20% when compared to fiscal 1995. Gross profit for fiscal 1996 increased 75.2% to $55.0 million, or 13.8% of net sales, from $31.4 million or 16.0% of net sales, for fiscal 1995. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to the higher sales volume in fiscal 1996. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of work performed under long term contracts assumed from Aviall that have not been generating margins as high as the Companys pre acquisition operations. The Company is continuing the implementation of its integration plan, which is engineered to coordinate production efforts, reduce turnaround times, and minimize duplication of support functions in purchasing, technical and field services, and management information systems. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1996 increased 68.9% to $23.0 million, or 5.8% of net sales, from $13.6 million, or 6.9% of net sales for fiscal 1995. The increase was primarily due to the addition of marketing and administrative expenses in support of the increased business activity that has resulted from the acquisition of the Aviall Business, as well as the 20% increase in revenues generated by the Companys pre acquisition operations. 16 Interest expense for fiscal 1996 increased 59.2% to $12.7 million, or 3.2% of net sales, from $8.0 million, or 4.0% of net sales, for fiscal 1995, primarily due to approximately $5.0 million of interest accrued through September 30 from the sale of $160 million of 10.5% senior notes on June 5, 1996. As a result of the above factors, net income for fiscal year 1996 increased 90.2% to $11.8 million, or $.83 per share on 14.3 million average shares of Common Stock outstanding (fully diluted) compared to $6.2 million or $.54 per share on 12.8 million average shares of Common Stock outstanding (fully diluted) for fiscal year 1995. FISCAL 1995 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 1994 Net sales for fiscal 1995 increased 86.6% to $196.3 million, from $105.2 million for fiscal 1994. This increase resulted from strong sales gains in all four of the Companys marketing and technical units and the Companys ability to capitalize on the trend toward outsourcing in the commercial aviation and military markets. Additionally, fiscal 1995 marked the Companys first full year of sales produced by Greenwich Connecticut, with Greenwich Connecticut sales of $72.4 million in fiscal 1995, as compared to sales of $28.9 million for only five and one half months of fiscal 1994. Gross profit for fiscal 1995 increased 81.7% to $31.4 million, or 16.0% of net sales, from $17.3 million or 16.4% of net sales, for fiscal 1994. This increase in gross profit is primarily due to the Companys increased net sales during the period. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the timing of the integration of the operations of Greenwich Connecticut and a shift in product mix to a greater proportion of low and medium by pass engines. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1995 increased 94.7% to $13.6 million, or 7.0% of net sales, from $7.0 million, or 6.6% of net sales for fiscal 1994. The increase was primarily due to the addition of marketing and administrative expenses from increased business activity, a full year of Greenwich Connecticut operations, the write off of uncollectible accounts and the higher incentive bonus expense related to the Companys financial performance. Interest expense for fiscal 1995 increased 67.1% to $8.0 million, or 4.0% of net sales, from $4.8 million, or 4.5% of net sales, for fiscal 1994, primarily due to an increase in the Companys average borrowings during the period as a result of increased business activity and the acquisition of Greenwich Connecticut. As a result of the above factors, net income increased 85.3% to $6.2 million, or 3.2% of net sales, for fiscal 1995, from $3.3 million, or 3.2% of net sales, for fiscal 1994. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since the consummation of the Aviall Acquisition, the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the New Credit Facility, the Companys primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Facility. In addition, other sources of liquidity have been advance payments for power station installations and other customer progress payments. Since the Aviall acquisition, and through November 30, 1996, the Company had borrowed aproximately $53.7 million additional under the New Credit Facility in order to restock former Aviall Business inventories to an adequate level, purchase additional inventory and aircraft engines required to service certain customers under new and existing contracts, and to fund expenditures related to the integration of the former Aviall Business with the Companys operations. The Company will be required to borrow additional amounts under the New Credit Facility in the near future in order to fund current asset increases in support of business growth, reduce accounts payable, fund further integration expenses, and satisfy interest payment obligations under the Senior Notes. The Companys liquidity has been affected by the substantial indebtedness the Company has incurred in connection with the financing of the Aviall acquisition, which has substantially increased the Companys cash requirements for debt service and has imposed various operating restrictions. The New Credit Facility and the Indenture under which the Notes were offered contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, make certain investments, transact with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. See "New Credit Facility", below. 17 The Companys aggregate capital expenditures for fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $1.7 million, $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Prior to the Companys acquisition of the Aviall Business, Aviall had spent in excess of $84.0 million over five years to build state of the art engine repair and overhaul facilities in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas and in Prestwick, Scotland. Management anticipates that the total capital expenditures for fiscal 1997 will be approximately $6.0 million, which will be used to fund the purchase of production tooling and data processing equipment. Management plans to fund these capital expenditures from cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under the New Credit Facility. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996, the Companys cash used by operations was $8.2 million; cash used for investing activities was $234.0 million; and cash generated by financing activities was $242.4 million. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operations and plans for integrating the Aviall Business, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the New Credit Facility, will be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements, including scheduled interest and principal payments, integration expenses, capital expenditures and working capital needs. The Companys (i) income from operations (excluding non recurring charges) for the twelve months ended September 30, 1995 and the twelve months ended September 30, 1996 totaled $17.7 million and $31.9 million, respectively and (ii) working capital as of September 30, 1996 was $273.6 million. The Company believes that the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business following the Aviall Acquisition has resulted in opportunities to improve cash flows by capitalizing on the cost savings resulting from the elimination of duplicative functions in the areas of administration, sales, marketing, purchasing, technical and field services and management information systems. However, the Company has incurred expenditures of approximately $2.0 million as of November 30, 1996 related to the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business and expects to incur additional expenditures in the future of approximately $6.5 million related to such integration, which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 1997. Such non recurring expenditures include amounts related to integration of management information systems and other costs of consolidation. These non recurring expenditures have been funded with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the New Credit Facility. SUMMARY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS NEW CREDIT FACILITY Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition and the related Equity Offering and Senior Note Offering, the Company refinanced substantially all of its indebtedness under its existing credit facility through a new loan and security agreement (the "New Credit Facility") with a group of secured lenders (collectively, the "Senior Lenders"). Under the New Credit Facility, which expires in June 2001, the Senior Lenders have provided the Company with two senior secured revolving credit facilities in the aggregate amount of up to $175.0 million secured by the Companys accounts receivable, inventories and contract rights. Advances under the New Credit Facility are based upon percentages of outstanding eligible accounts receivable, and inventories. Concurrently with the refinancing under the New Credit Facility, an aggregate of approximately $67.7 million was borrowed primarily to pay down existing revolver debt, finance a portion of the purchase price for the Aviall acquisition, and secure outstanding letters of credit. The New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants (relating to minimum ratios of cash flow to fixed charges, minimum ratio of funded debt to cash flow and minimum tangible net worth) and other covenants, including limitations on additional debt (in excess of the Notes, Debentures and other outstanding debt), dividends and changes in control. Under the New Credit Facility, the Company may elect to borrow at either (i) the lenders prime rate, plus 0.875% (subject to reduction to 0.5% or increase to 1.125% based upon the Companys achieving or failing to achieve certain financial goals), or (ii) the LIBOR rate (adjustable every three months) plus 2.375%. As at November 30, 1996, the lenders prime rate was 8.25% and the two month LIBOR rate was 5.50%, and the Companys available line of credit under the New Credit Facility was approximately $71.9 million. 18 TERM DEBT TERM LOAN. In November 1992, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a commercial lender for a five year, $9.0 million term loan expiring in November 1997 (the "Term Loan"). The Term Loan is secured by certain of the Companys equipment and tooling which, as of September 30,1996, had a net book value of approximately $10.9 million. This loan bears interest at 8.75% per annum, payable in 59 monthly installments (including principal and interest) of $143,205 each, and a final payment of approximately $3.3 million due on November 1, 1997. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the Term Loan was $4.6 million. CONNECTICUT TERM LOAN. On May 26, 1994, the Company and Greenwich Connecticut entered into a separate loan and security agreement with a lender for a five year, $8.0 million term loan expiring in May 1999 (the "Connecticut Term Loan"). The Connecticut Term Loan is secured by substantially all of Greenwich Connecticuts fixed assets (excluding real estate) which, as of September 30, 1996, had a net book value of approximately $16.1 million. This loan bears interest at a rate of 8.99% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. Principal repayments under this agreement are to be made in 24 consecutive monthly installments of $166,667 each and an additional 36 consecutive monthly installments of $111,111 each, with all such payments ending in May 1999. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the Connecticut Term Loan was $3.3 million. LOAN PAYABLE TO WAL. In November 1992, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with WAL for a five year, $3.0 million term loan expiring in November 1997 (the "WAL Loan"). The WAL Loan is co secured by the same equipment and tooling as the Term Loan, and bears interest at 10.25% per annum, payable in 59 monthly installments (including principal and interest) of $50,519 each, and a final payment of approximately $1.1 million due on November 1, 1997. On April 1, 1994, subject to the terms and conditions of the Connecticut Term Loan, WAL agreed to grant a priority lien position to the lender under the Connecticut Term Loan on the Companys tooling and equipment. In return, WAL was granted a priority lien position on specific tooling and a first mortgage on certain real property that the Company owns in East Granby, Connecticut. As of November 30, 1996, the balance of the WAL loan was $1.5 million. SENIOR NOTE OFFERING Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition, the Company consummated a public offering (the "Senior Note Offering") of $160.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 10 1/2% Senior Notes due 2006 (the "Notes"). The total proceeds to the Company, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, were approximately $154.7 million. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, rank PARI PASSU with all unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes are not redeemable prior to June 1, 2001; however, at any time on or after June 1, 2001, the Notes are redeemable at the Option of the Company, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to: (a) 105.25%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2001; (b) 103.50%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2002; (c) 101.75%, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing June 1, 2003; and (d) 100%, if redeemed thereafter, beginning June 1, 2004. The Notes are also guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by each of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and are secured on a PARI PASSU basis with the indebtedness under the Companys senior credit facility by a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of Greenwich Caledonian Limited (formerly, Aviall Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Indenture for the Notes, dated as of June 1, 1996, between the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Trustee, contains limitations on, among other things, (a) the incurrence of additional Company indebtedness, (b) the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of preferred stock by Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined), (c) the payment of dividends and other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Company and the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock of the Company, (d) the making of certain Investments (as defined), (e) the incurrence of certain Liens (as defined), (f) the issuance and sale of capital stock of, and certain payments by, Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined), (g) transactions with Affiliates (as defined), (h) the designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and (I) consolidations, mergers and transfers of assets. 19 EQUITY OFFERING Concurrently with the consummation of the Aviall acquisition, the Company consummated a public offering (the "Equity Offering") of 4,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. Of the 4,000,000 Class B shares sold in connection with the Equity Offering, 3,400,000 Class B shares were sold by the Company, and 600,000 Class B Shares were sold by Eugene P. Conese, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (sometimes referred to herein as the "Selling Stockholder"). The total proceeds to the Company and the Selling Stockholder, net of underwriting discounts and expenses, were approximately $80.7 million and $14.3 million, respectively. The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Class B Common Stock by the Selling Stockholder in the Equity Offering. SUBORDINATED DEBT 8% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES. In November and December 1993, the Company issued $16,999,000 principal amount of the Debentures. On October 2, 1996, the Company announced that it intended to redeem all of the outstanding Debentures on November 25, 1996, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any unpaid interest accrued to November 25, 1996. Prior to the redemption, all $2.5 million of the then outstanding debentures were converted by the holders thereof, at a conversion price of $5.85 per share, into approximately 428,000 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock. STOCK DIVIDEND On May 8, 1996 the Company distributed to holders of the Companys Class A Common Stock one share of Class B Common Stock for each share of Class A Common Stock outstanding. The rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical, except that their Class B Common Stock has no voting rights. USE OF PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OFFERING AND SENIOR NOTE OFFERING AND NEW CREDIT FACILITY The net proceeds to the Company from the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the Initial Drawdown, after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses, totaled approximately $299.9 million. Approximately $230.1 million was utilized to pay the purchase price for the Aviall Business, and approximately $55.3 million was utilized to repay outstanding advances under the Companys existing credit facilities. In addition, approximately $5.6 million was used to pay expenses relating to the Aviall acquisition, the Equity and Senior Note Offerings and the New Credit Facility. Such expenses did not, however, include expenses relating to the integration of the operations of the Company and the Aviall Business, which are estimated to be approximately $8.5 million. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of" (SFAS N. 121), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. SFAS No. 121 requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123 does not rescind or interpret existing accounting rules for employee stock based arrangements. Under SFAS No. 123, the Company may continue to follow existing rules to recognize and measure compensation, but they will now be required to disclose the pro forma amounts of net income and earnings per share that would have to be reported had the Company elected to follow the "fair value" recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123 will apply to the Company beginning with the year ended September 30, 1997. The Company has not determined whether it will elect to recognize and measure compensation expense under SFAS No. 123 and has not yet determined its effect, if any, on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 20
