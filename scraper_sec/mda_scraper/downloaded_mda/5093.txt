ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2006, substantially all of our revenue was directly or indirectly derived from reimbursements generated by Medicare Advantage health plans. As a result, our revenue and profitability are dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. See "ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Medicare", " Medicare Modernization Act". For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, approximately 86.9% of our revenue came from the Humana Agreements. The Humana Agreements have one year terms and renew automatically each December 31 for additional one year terms unless terminated for cause or upon 180 days prior notice. Failure to maintain the Humana Agreements on favorable terms would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Humana Agreements and the CMS Agreement are risk agreements under which the PSN and the HMO, respectively, receive net monthly payments per Participating Customer at a rate established by the agreements, also called a capitated fee. In accordance with the agreements, the capitated fee is a function of the number of Participating Customers, regardless of the actual utilization rate of covered services. To the extent that the Participating Customers require more care than is anticipated, aggregate capitation fees may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with the treatment of such customers. If medical expenses exceed our estimates, except in very limited circumstances, we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then current terms. Relatively small changes in our ratio of medical expense to revenue can create significant changes in our financial results. Accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported ( "IBNR") claims, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and or cash flows. See "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS" for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in this Form 10 K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management. We believe that our most critical accounting policies include "Use of Estimates, Revenue, Expense and Receivables" and "Use of Estimates, Deferred Tax Asset." Use of Estimates, Revenue, Expense and Receivables. Revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed and paid to us on a monthly basis. We assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs. Premium revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses for these contracts in our consolidated financial statements. We record health care premium payments we receive in advance of the service period as unearned premiums. CMS periodically retroactively adjusts the premiums paid to us based on the updated health status of participants. The factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors, risk adjustment scores, customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under Part D of the Medicare program. In addition, CMS also retroactively adjusts the number of customers enrolled in our HMO or PSN as a result of enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by Humana or CMS. These retroactive adjustments could, in the near term, materially impact the revenue that has been recorded by us for both our HMO and PSN. We record any adjustments to this revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from Humana or CMS and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured. 34 Medical expenses for both the PSN and HMO are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical expense disputes. We develop estimates for medical expense incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical expense trends. The actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we accrue to the low end of the range. We accrue to the low end of the range, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss, which states that when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount should be accrued. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical expense disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimate recorded in prior year periods become more exact, we adjust the amount of our liability estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. While we believe our medical expenses payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required, such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions. Therefore, the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded. See "Notes 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "RISK FACTORS "A Failure To Estimate Incurred But Not Reported..." Use of Estimates, Deferred Tax Asset. We have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $7.4 million at December 31, 2006. Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future. In order to utilize the deferred tax assets, we would have to generate taxable income of approximately $19.7 million. We believe that our current operations will generate sufficient income to fully utilize this asset. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are modified and those changes could be material (see "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). In the event we determine that we cannot, on a more likely than not basis, realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to establish a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made. Net operating loss carryforwards by year of expiration are as follows: Year of Expiration Amount 2022 $15,098,000 2025 1,193,000 $16,291,000 Pending Adoption of an Accounting Pronouncement In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable. We are currently evaluating the effect this Interpretation will have on our financial position, liquidity and statement of income. 35 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncement During the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Qualifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. We determined that in 2004 we had included in our operating loss carryforward a tax benefit of approximately $513,000 that related to a subsidiary that had previously been liquidated. As a result of the prior liquidation of this subsidiary, the losses related to that subsidiary were not available to us and should not have been included in our deferred tax benefit when that benefit was realized in 2004 as a result of a reduction of the valuation allowance. We evaluated this matter using both the balance sheet (iron curtain) and income statement (rollover) approaches and concluded that the impact of this error was not material in 2004. We have determined that the impact of correcting this misstatement is material in 2006 and, therefore, as allowed by SAB 108, have recorded this as a cumulative effect change in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Impact of Inflation Inflation has a significant impact on the cost of medical care. According to a report issued in February 2007 by the Office of the Actuary at CMS, health care outlays are projected to grow at a rate of 6.4% annually between 2007 and 2016. The projected principal drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation, inflation, continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic. We seek to minimize the impact of these increases by developing fixed fee or capitated arrangements that run for multiple years and which include built price increases that are more in line with the projected increases in Medicare reimbursement, which we are estimating to be approximately 3% annually. Share Based Payments Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations including FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, to account for our fixed plan stock options. Under this method, compensation expense was recorded for fixed plan stock options only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of grant. SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement No. 123 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans. 36 Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment using the modified prospective transition method therefore we have not restated prior period results. Under the transition method, stock based compensation expense for 2006 includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of SFAS No. 123. As of December 31, 2006, there was $716,637 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Comparison of 2006 and 2005 Summary For the year ended December 31, 2006, we realized revenue of $228.2 million compared to $183.8 million in the prior year, an increase of approximately $44.4 million or 24.2%. Medical expenses for 2006 were $205.6 million, an increase of $40.5 million over 2005. Our ratio of medical expense to revenue (the "Medical Expense Ratio") increased to 90.1% in 2006 compared to 89.9% in 2005. As described below, effective July 1, 2005, the HMO began to provide services and realize revenue as compared to a full year of operations in 2006. Income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2006 was $826,000 compared to $3.8 million in 2005. As described below, our results of operations for 2006, like those of 2005, continue to be negatively impacted by the losses related to the operations of our Medicare Advantage HMO. Net income for 2006 was $473,000 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net earnings per share, basic was $0.01 for 2006 compared to $0.05 for 2005. The decrease in the basic net earnings per share in 2006, while primarily due to the decrease in net income, is also partially affected by the increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding, from 48,975,803 in 2005 to 50,032,555 in the current year. The majority of the shares issued during 2006 relate to shares issued upon the exercise of stock options. In both 2005 and 2006, we operated in two financial reporting segments, the PSN business and the Medicare Advantage HMO business. The PSN reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $4.4 million or 28.4% increase as compared to the prior year. The HMO segment, which commenced operations in July 2005, incurred a net loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a loss of $6.6 million in 2005. Allocated overhead amounted to $7.4 million and $5.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Customer Information The table set forth below provides (i) the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services through the PSN and HMO as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and (ii) the aggregate customers months the PSN and the HMO during 2006 and 2005. Customers at Customer December 31 Months In 2006 2005 2006 2005 PSN 25,600 26,200 309,000 315,000 HMO 3,800 1,400 35,600 4,200 Total 29,400 27,600 344,600 319,200 37 At February 1, 2007 the HMO had approximately 4,600 customers and the PSN had approximately 25,700 customers. In August 2005, the PSN discontinued its contractual relationship with one of its South Florida based physician practices providing care to approximately 110 of the Humana Participating Customers and discontinued our contractual relationship with two additional South Florida based physician practices providing care to approximately 680 of the Humana Participating Customers due to non compliance with our policies and procedures. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the revenue and medical expenses related to these practices were $3.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, resulting in a medical expense ratio of 104.2% and a net loss of approximately $163,000. Revenue Year Ended December 31 $ % 2006 2005 Increase Change PSN revenue from Humana $198,429,000 $179,646,000 $18,783,000 10.5% Percentage of total revenue 86.9% 97.8% HMO revenue 28,235,000 2,825,000 25,410,000 899.5% Percentage of total revenue 12.4% 1.5% Other 1,552,000 1,294,000 258,000 19.9% Percentage of total revenue 0.7% 0.7% Total revenue $228,216,000 $183,765,000 $44,451,000 24.2% Revenue for 2006 increased $44.5 million, or 24.2%, over the prior year, from $183.8 million to $228.2 million. PSN revenue is comprised of the following: Year Ended December 31 $ Increase % 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Humana premiums $198,429,000 $179,646,000 $18,783,000 10.5% Fee for service 1,551,000 1,294,000 $ 257,000 19.9% Total $199,980,000 $180,940,000 $19,040,000 10.5% PSN revenue increased 10.5%, from $180.9 million in 2005 to $200.0 million in 2006. The PSNs significant source of revenue during both 2006 and 2005 was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the Humana Agreements (the "Humana Related Revenue"). The Humana Related Revenue increased from $179.6 million in 2005 to $198.4 million in 2006, an increase of approximately 10.5%. The increase in Humana Related Revenue in 2006 (the "Humana Increase") is primarily attributable to: o approximately $21.4 million in rate increase of which $19.1 million of the increase related to Medicare Part D; and o Medicare risk adjustments ("MRA") that were retroactively approved by CMS in 2006 for 2004 and 2005 (approximately $809,000 of the Humana Increase). CMS adjusts the payments made to health plans based on changes on the MRA score. The purpose of risk adjustment is to use health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. From 2000 to 2003, risk adjusted payment accounted for only 10% of Medicare health plans payment, with the remaining 90% based on demographic factors. In 2004 and 2005, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30% and 50%, respectively. The portion of risk adjusted payment increased to 75% in 2006, with a 100% phase in of risk adjusted payment in 2007. The retroactive payments increased revenue in 2006. 38 This Humana Increase was primarily offset by a 2.0% decrease in Humana Participating Customer months from 315,000 in 2005 to 309,000 in 2006, which decreased Humana Related Revenue by approximately $3.3 million. As previously discussed, the decline in customer months in 2006 from 2005 was primarily a result of the termination of the contractual relationship with certain physicians during the last half of 2005. The PSNs average per customer per month premium increased during 2006 approximately 15% in the Central Florida market and 7% in the South Florida market as compared to 2005. This increase is substantially due to the Part D premium, which began in 2006. Based on the payments we have received from Humana in early 2007, we believe that the per customer per month premium from Humana will increase approximately 3% to 4% from 2006. The fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non Humana customers in our owned physician practices. Revenue for the HMO was $28.2 million in 2006 as compared to $2.8 million in 2005. The HMO began generating revenue during the last two quarters of 2005. The increase in revenue in 2006 is primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base during 2006 and the operation of the HMO for the full year. Included in the HMOs 2006 revenue is approximately $53,000 attributable to MRA scores that were retroactively approved by CMS in 2006 for 2005. We have estimated that the retroactive MRA score adjustment in 2007 for 2006 will not have a material impact on our revenue. However, there can be no assurance that our estimate of the retroactive risk score adjustment will not be materially different than that is ultimately approved by CMS. See "RISK FACTORS CMSs Risk Adjustment Payment System and Budget Neutrality..."

In 2006 we incurred approximately $40.4 million in expenses related to our HMO division, compared to $9.5 million in 2005. Total Medical Expenses Total medical expenses represent the total costs of providing patient care and are comprised of two components, direct medical expenses and other medical expenses. Total medical expenses were $205.6 million and $165.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our Medical Expense Ratio increased from 89.9% in 2005 to 90.1% in the current year. Approximately $195.0 or 94.8% of our total medical expenses in 2006 are attributable to direct medical services such as inpatient and outpatient services, pharmacy benefits and physician services by non affiliated providers. In 2005, approximately $154.8 or 93.8% of our total medical expenses were attributable to direct medical services. The increase is due, in part, to the fact that the HMO was in operation for all of 2006 and the HMOs direct medical expenses increased by approximately $26.5 million. The PSNs direct medical expenses increased by approximately $13.7 million, primarily as a result of the drug costs associated with the Part D benefit implemented in 2006. Other medical expenses include the salaries, taxes and benefits of the PSNs affiliated health professionals providing primary care services, as well as other costs associated with the operations of those practices. Approximately $10.6 million of our total medical expenses in 2006 related to physician practices we own as compared to $10.3 million in 2005. 39 Because the Humana Agreements provide that the PSN is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the Humana Participating Customers, direct medical expenses include the cost of medical services provided to Humana Participating Customers by providers other than the PSNs affiliated providers ("Non Affiliated Providers"). The Medical Expense Ratio for the PSN segment improved to 88.4% in 2006 as compared to 89.9% in 2005. During 2006, the PSN implemented various medical management techniques to improve the medical management of our customers. Some of these techniques included chart audits for all PSN Physicians, increasing our focus on certain elements of our Partners in Quality Program, implementing an outreach program for our more acutely ill customers in an effort to better manage the care for these individuals and developing a comprehensive recovery plan for customers that had serious events, such as hospitalizations or significant procedures. During 2005, the PSN incurred approximately $4.0 million of medical expenses related to the implantation of certain Implantable Automatic Defibrillators ("AICD"). CMS has directed that the costs of certain of these procedures that meet 2005 eligibility requirements be paid by CMS rather than billed to Medicare Advantage plans. At December 31, 2005, we had estimated a recovery for AICD claims we had paid at December 31, 2005 of approximately $2.2 million, which was recorded as a reduction of medical expenses in 2005. During 2006, we continued to work with Humana to make certain that these cases met the eligibility criteria for payment by CMS. As a result of this effort, during 2006 we collected approximately $260,000 of this amount and recorded a charge of $1.6 million to medical expenses to reflect managements concern about the ultimate collectibility of this amount in light of, among other things, revised guidance by CMS regarding its reimbursement policies. At December 31, 2006 we estimated future recoveries of approximately $270,000 related to AICDs implanted in 2005. These amounts decreased our Medical Expense Ratio by 1.2 % in 2005 and increased our Medical Expense Ratio by .8% in 2006. On February 26, 2007, CMS sent a notice to all Medicare Advantage organizations that certain formulas that had previously been provided by CMS for 2006 involving in the Part D risk corridor calculations were in error and needed to be corrected. These formulas related to fixed and flexible capitated Part D payment demonstration target amounts. The HMO was not impacted by these formula errors however; the PSN, through Humana, provides drug coverage that includes these types of arrangements. Since this formula error impacted 2006, we computed the impact and decreased our 2006 revenue by approximately $1.2 million for the estimated amount that we will be required to refund back to CMS through Humana. The HMOs Medical Expense Ratio in 2006 was 102.4% as compared to 85.4% in 2005. Substantially all of this increase was attributed to the rapid growth of HMO in 2006, which, among other things, negatively impacted the medical management process and also resulted in higher than expected costs paid for medical services. During 2006, as a part of the medical management process, primary care physicians were required to pre approve all medical services provided to the customer. We have determined that this pre approval requirement was not effective and resulted in excess utilization and higher than expected costs paid for medical services. In early 2007, we have changed this process and now require the HMOs medical director pre approve for certain services. As a result of the increased number of customers, the HMO is renegotiating the rates paid to certain hospitals and providers of outpatient services. We anticipate that as our customer base continues to grow, we will be able to positively impact our HMOs Medical Expense Ratio by entering into more capitated, rather than fee for service, contracts. At December 31, 2006, we estimated our IBNR accrual for the HMO was between $4.6 million and $5.3 million and we recorded a liability of $4.6 million. At December 31, 2005, our IBNR accrual was estimated to be $694,000. Claims paid for 2005 in 2006 totaled $960,000 which exceeded the estimated accrual by $266,000. This difference was recorded as additional claims expense in 2006. The IBNR for the PSN at December 31, 2006 was determined to be between $11.5 million and $13.6 million and, as is our policy, we recorded an accrual of $11.5 million. At December 31, 2005, the IBNR accrual was estimated to be $12.5 million compared to actual claims paid in 2006 for 2005 of $13.2 million, a difference of $743,000. This difference increased medical expense in 2006. Administrative Payroll, Payroll Taxes and Benefits 40 Administrative payroll, taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive, administrative and sales staff. For 2006, administrative payroll, taxes and benefits were $10.8 million, compared to the prior years total of $6.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million. Administrative payroll, taxes and benefit costs associated with the HMO segment were $4.2 million in 2006 as compared to $2.5 million in 2005, an increase of approximately 68%. The HMO commenced operations in 2005 and these costs were incurred for only a portion of the year. In addition, during 2006 we increased the number of full time equivalents employed by the HMO from 47 to 71 as the number of customers enrolled in the HMO increased. As the HMO increased in size and activity we also increased our corporate staff from 49 at December 31, 2005 to 68 at December 31, 2006, resulting in an increase in administrative payroll, taxes and benefits to $4.3 million in 2006 as compared to $2.5 million in 2005, a 72% increase. Substantially all of this increase is a result of the addition of new employees or a full year of compensation for employees added in 2005 with approximately $736,000 of the increase related to stock based compensation expense. Marketing and Advertising Marketing and advertising expense, which are primarily advertising expense and commissions, for 2006 was $3.7 million in 2006 as compared to $2.8 million in 2005, an increase of 32.1%. When we launched the HMO in the second half of 2005, we incurred large initial marketing and advertising costs while introducing, branding and selling our HMO product. In 2006, we continued to brand our plan and also increased our marketing and advertising for new customers. Commencing in 2006, CMS instituted a limited enrollment period for Medicare Advantage plans between November and March which increased our marketing and advertising costs during the last quarter of 2006. We expect that these costs will decline slightly in 2007. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for 2006 amounted to $8.3 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 43.2% over the prior year. Approximately $1.8 million of this increase is attributable to the HMO being operational for all of 2006. The HMO incurred increased costs of $593,000 for claims processing and customer services costs, $400,000 in professional services fees primarily attributable to the expansion in 2007, $269,000 in lease costs relating to rents for the entire year and $149,000 in recruitment costs. Corporate general and administrative costs increased approximately $668,000 as a result of an increase in fees paid to our Board of Directors of $140,000; professional service costs of approximately $250,000, recruitment costs of $141,000 and lease costs of $70,000. Other Income (Expense) We realized other income of $617,000 in 2005 compared to $1.1 million in 2006. The increase was primarily as a result of an increase in investment income of $607,000 as we had more cash to invest and rates increased over 2005. Cash is invested in highly liquid securities, primarily certificates of deposits with short term maturities and money market fund. We expect to continue to invest our excess cash in this manner in 2007. Income taxes The 2006 results included income taxes of approximately $353,000, as compared to $1.5 million. This difference is a result of the decrease in pre tax income between 2005 and 2006. Comparison of 2005 and 2004 Summary For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized revenue of $183.8 million compared to $158.1 million in the prior year, an increase of $25.7 million or 16.3%. Medical expenses for 2005 were $165.1 million, an increase of $27.3 million over 2004, resulting in an increase in our medical expense ratio from 87.1% to 89.9%. Income before income taxes for 2005 was $3.8 million compared to $11.5 million in 2004. As described below, the 2005 results reflect losses related to the start up operations of our Medicare Advantage HMO. Net income for 2005, inclusive of an income tax provision of $1.5 million, was $2.4 million compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The prior year included a $7.4 million tax benefit recorded at December 31, 2004. Basic net earnings per share, inclusive of a $0.03 charge to income tax, was $0.05 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $0.42 in 2004. The prior year included $0.16 per share attributable to the $7.4 million tax benefit recorded at December 31, 2004. The decrease in the basic net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005, while primarily due to the decrease in net income, partially reflects the increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding, from 45,123,843 at December 31, 2004 to 48,975,803 in the current year. The majority of the shares issued during 2005 relate to shares issued upon the exercise of stock options. 41 In both 2004 and 2005, we operated in two financial reporting segments, the PSN business and the Medicare Advantage HMO business. The PSN reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the prior year. We began developing the Medicare Advantage HMO in the second half of 2004, and officially launched operations in July 2005. The HMO segment incurred a net loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to a net loss of only $433,000 in 2004. Allocated overhead amounted to $5.0 million and $5.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information. Customer Information Total Medicare Advantage lives, the number of Medicare beneficiaries cared for by either our PSN or HMO, increased by approximately 900 customers from December 2004 to approximately 27,600 customers at December 2005. Customer months, the combined total customers of the HMO and PSN for each month of the measurement period, were 319,200 and 304,000 for the 2005 and 2004 years, respectively. Included in these numbers was approximately 4,200 customer months in our HMO in 2005, its first year of operation. Total customers enrolled in the HMO were approximately 1,400 at December 2005. The HMOs marketing efforts in December generated approximately 400 additional customers effective January 1, 2006. During the year we discontinued our contractual relationship with three of our South Florida physician practices due to non compliance with our policies and procedures. These centers accounted for approximately 790 customers, with corresponding revenue and medical expenses for the nine months of $3.9 million and $4.1 million, respectively, resulting in a medical expense ratio of 104.2% and a net loss of approximately $163,000 on this business. Two of the centers, accounting for approximately 680 of the customers, were cancelled effective October 1, 2005. The other center was cancelled effective August 1, 2005. Revenue Year Ended % 12/31/2005 12/31/2004 Change PSN revenue from Humana $179,646,000 $156,648,000 14.7% Percentage of total revenue 97.8% 99.1% HMO revenue 2,825,000 n/a Percentage of total revenue 1.5% 0.0% Other 1,294,000 1,421,000 8.9% Percentage of total revenue 0.7% 0.9% Total revenue $183,765,000 $158,069,000 16.3% Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $25.7 million, or 16.3%, over the prior year, from $158.1 million to $183.8 million. PSN revenue from Humana increased 14.7%, from $156.6 million to $179.6 million. Approximately $15.4 million in incremental revenue was generated by 2005 premium and MRA increases that averaged approximately 9.6% in the Daytona market and 10.5% in South Florida, with the net increase in the customer base accounting for the balance. Included in the 2005 funding increases were MRA increases totaling approximately $2.9 million. The purpose of risk adjustment is to use health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. From 2000 to 2003, risk adjusted payment accounted for only 10% of Medicare health plans payment, with the remaining 90% based on demographic factors. In 2004 and 2005, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30% and 50%, respectively. The portion of risk adjusted payment has increased to 75% in 2006, with the 100% phase in of risk adjusted payment to be completed in 2007. 42 For the last two years, we believe our has been positively impacted by Medicares risk adjustment program. See "RISK FACTORS CMSs Risk Adjustment Payment System and Budget Neutrality..." Revenue for our newly operational HMO amounted to $2.8 million for 2005, all of which was generated in the last two quarters of the year. Expenses Year Ended % 12/31/2005 12/31/2004 Change Total medical expenses 165,131,000 137,756,000 19.9% Percentage of total revenue 89.9% 87.1% Administrative payroll, payroll taxes and benefits 6,867,000 $ 4,394,000 56.3% Percentage of total revenue 3.7% 2.8% Marketing and advertising 2,754,000 139,000 1884.0% Percentage of total revenue 1.5% 0.1% General and administrative 5,781,000 3,924,000 47.3% Percentage of total revenue 3.1% 2.5% Total expenses $180,533,000 $146,213,000 23.5% Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $34.3 million over the prior year period, from $146.2 million to $180.5 million. The 2005 year included approximately $9.5 million in expenses related to our HMO division, compared to only $460,000 in 2004. Total Medical Expenses Total medical expenses represent the total costs of providing patient care and are comprised of two components, direct medical expenses and other medical expenses. Medical expenses totaled $165.1 million and $137.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our medical expense ratio ("MER"), the ratio of total medical expense to revenue, increased from 87.1% in 2004 to 89.9% in the current year. The MER was adversely affected by a number of factors. The costs of plan benefit enhancements designed to increase enrollment approximated the 2005 funding increases, resulting in an incremental MER increase of 0.9% over the prior year. Second, as discussed above, we discontinued our relationships with three South Florida physician practices, which operated at an MER exceeding 104% for 2005, resulting in an overall 2005 MER increase of 0.4% over 2004. The balance of the MER increase (1.5%) was due to increased utilization and cost increases. The MER for our HMO division was approximately 85.4% Administrative Payroll, Payroll Taxes and Benefits Administrative payroll, taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive administrative and sales staff. For 2005, administrative payroll, taxes and benefits were $6.9 million, compared to the prior years total of $4.4 million. Our HMO segment accounted for all of the net increase. Marketing and Advertising Marketing and advertising expense for 2005 was $2.8 million, compared to only $139,000 in 2004. This represents the costs and sales commissions incurred to launch our HMO AdvantageCare brand, and advertise and sell our new HMO product. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses for 2005 amounted to $5.8 million, an increase of $1.9 million over the prior year period. This increase is primarily attributable to the following expenses incurred in connection with the in the development, launch and operations of our HMO, principally with respect to legal and accounting, outsourced claims and customer services, and software implementation. 43 Other Income and Expenses Other income and expenses increased from an expense of $382,000 in 2004 to income of $617,000 in 2005. Other income and expenses for 2005 included a decrease in interest expense of $282,000 from the prior year as we repaid all of the debt and IRS obligations in 2005. Investment income increased $349,000 for the year while other income increased $117,000, primarily resulting from refunds of prior year IRS interest and penalty charges relating to our discontinued pharmacy division. Included in 2004 was a $200,000 reserve on the note receivable from the purchaser ("Purchaser") of the pharmacy operations in 2003. This note was due in May 2004 and was in default as of December 31, 2004. On February 11, 2005, we and the Purchaser executed a settlement agreement requiring the note to be repaid in monthly installments ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, with interest at 8%, until paid in full. Approximately $52,000 of this note plus interest was collected in 2005 and included in other income and expenses. Income taxes The 2005 results included income taxes of approximately $1.5 million, as compared to a $7.4 million tax benefit in 2004 resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset, resulting in a decrease in net income from 2004 to 2005 of approximately $8.8 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Total cash and equivalents at December 31, 2006 totaled approximately $23.1 million as compared to approximately $15.6 million at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $19.6 million as compared to a working capital surplus of approximately $21.1 million as of December 31, 2005, a decrease of approximately $1.5 million or 7.2%. This decrease is primarily a result of decreasing the current portion of the deferred tax asset between 2005 and 2006 by $1.9 million. The HMO is required to maintain statutory minimum net worth requirements established by the Florida State Department of Insurance. At December 31, 2006, the statutory minimum net worth requirements was approximately $4.8 million and actual net deficit was approximately $1.3 million. Subsequent to year end, we transferred approximately $6.5 million to the HMO so that the HMO complies with all applicable statutory requirements. At December 31, 2006 the statutorily restricted cash and cash equivalents totals $12.5 million, including the $6.5 million transferred subsequent to year end as an addition to statutory net worth. The HMO is restricted from making dividend payments without appropriate regulatory notifications and approvals or to the extent such dividends would put them in non compliance with statutory net worth requirements. At December 31, 2006, all of the HMOs cash and cash equivalents are subject to these dividend restrictions. Statutorily restricted cash is available for us to pay the liabilities of the HMO. Our total stockholder equity increased approximately $1.2 million, or 4.1%, from approximately $29.7 million at December 31, 2005 to approximately $30.9 million at December 31, 2006. We have an investment policy with respect to the investment of our cash and equivalents. The investment policy goal is to obtain the highest yield possible while investing only in highly rated instruments or investments with nominal risk of loss of principal. The investment policy sets forth a list of "Permitted Investments" and provides that any exceptions to the policy must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer. At December 31, 2006, we had no outstanding debt. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 constituted approximately $9.2 million. The significant sources of cash from operating activities were: o an increase in estimated medical expenses payable of $4.0 million; o an increase in amounts due to CMS of $2.7 million; o net income of $473,000 o a decrease in deferred income taxes of $353,000; o an increase in net accounts receivable of $538,000, o depreciation and amortization of $554,000; and o an increase in accrued expenses of $474,000 million. The major use of cash in operating activities was an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $803,000.: 44 Our increase in estimated medical expenses payable, also known as IBNR, is primarily attributable to the growth of the HMO. The HMO began operations in July 2005 and had 1,400 customers at December 31, 2005. During 2006, our customer base increased to 3,800 customers at December 31, 2006. In addition, the HMOs medical expenses increased from $2.4 million in 2005 to $28.9 million in 2006. These factors significantly contributed to the increase in the IBNR. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $2.0 million of which $1.9 million was related to capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $377,000 which consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. On May 6, 2005 we executed a one year unsecured commercial line of credit agreement with a bank, which provides for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit of up to $1.0 million. This line of credit has been extended to March 2007. The outstanding balance, if any, bears interest at the banks prime rate. The credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement of $2.0 million. The availability under the line of credit secures a $1.0 million letter of credit that we have caused to be issued in favor of Humana. This arrangement allows for $1.0 million of cash, which was formerly invested in a certificate of deposit and recognized as restricted cash on our balance sheets, to be available for operations. We have not utilized this commercial line of credit in 2006 or 2005. Our HMO continues to require a considerable amount of capital. In 2006, we contributed approximately $6.8 million to the HMO to finance the operations and growth of the HMO. In the year ended December 31, 2006 the HMOs business generated an $11.7 million segment loss before allocated overhead and income taxes. Although we expect that revenue will exceed total medical expenses, we anticipate that the HMO will continue to generate a loss in 2007 before allocated overhead and income taxes. The amount of the loss will be determined by a number of factors including medical utilization and related costs, and our decisions related to expansion and growth efforts. We are still not in a position to meaningfully estimate when, if ever, the HMOs business will become profitable and or generate cash from operations, and we may be required to fund the development and expansion of the HMO business, including any associated losses, for an extended period of time. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the on going development efforts, reserve requirements and operating costs for our still developing HMO business can be funded by our current resources and projected cash flows from operations until at least December 31, 2007. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices. We do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future. We have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks, which we use in the normal course of our business operations. Intangible Asset Risk We have intangible assets and perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. As a result of our periodic evaluations, we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values, which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position. We evaluate the continuing value of goodwill by using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings, revenue, EBITDA (i.e., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) particularly with regard to entities similar to us that have recently been acquired. We also consider the market value of our own stock and those of companies similar to ours. As of December 31, 2006 we believe our intangible assets are recoverable, however, changes in the economy, the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability. We continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets. Equity Price Risk We do not own any equity investments, other than in our subsidiaries. As a result, we do not currently have any direct equity price risk. 45 Commodity Price Risk We do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities. As a result, we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk.
