Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview Our business strategy is to acquire inpatient behavioral health care facilities and improve operating results within our inpatient facilities and our other behavioral health care operations. From 2001 to 2004, we acquired 34 inpatient behavioral health care facilities. During 2005, we acquired 20 inpatient behavioral health care facilities in the acquisition of Ardent Health Services, Inc. and one other inpatient facility. During 2006, we acquired 19 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, including nine inpatient facilities with the acquisition of the capital stock of Alternative Behavioral Services, Inc. on December 1, 2006. During 2007, we acquired 16 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, including 15 inpatient facilities in the acquisition of Horizon Health Corporation (Horizon Health). During 2008, we acquired five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from United Medical Corporation (UMC) and opened Lincoln Prairie Behavioral Health Center, an 80 bed inpatient facility in Springfield, Illinois. During 2009, we opened Rolling Hills Hospital, an 80 bed inpatient facility in Franklin, Tennessee, acquired two inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and completed the sale of our EAP business. We strive to improve the operating results of our inpatient behavioral health care operations by providing the highest quality service, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives and meeting increased demand for behavioral health care services by expanding our services and developing new services. We also attempt to improve operating results by maintaining appropriate staffing ratios, controlling contract labor costs and reducing supply costs through group purchasing. Our same facility revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of increases in same facility patient days and same facility revenue per patient day. Same facility patient days increased 3.5% and same facility revenue per patient day increased 1.8% in 2009 compared to 2008. Same facility growth refers to the comparison of each inpatient facility owned during 2008 with the comparable period in 2009, adjusted for closures and combinations for comparability purposes. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased to $195.1 million, or 10.8% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $170.1 million, or 10.0% of revenue, for the same period of 2008. This increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period of 2008 was primarily the result of same facility revenue growth at our behavioral health care facilities of 5.3% for 2009 as compared to 2008 and a reduction in interest expense as a percentage of revenue to 4.0% in 2009 compared to 4.5% in 2008. Sources of Revenue Patient Service Revenue Patient service revenue is generated by our inpatient facilities for services provided to patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis within the inpatient behavioral health care facility setting. Patient service revenue is recorded at our established billing rates less contractual adjustments. Contractual adjustments are recorded to state our patient service revenue at the amount we expect to collect for the services provided based on amounts reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas or amounts due from other third party payors at contractually determined rates. Patient service revenue comprised approximately 93.0% of our total revenue in 2009. Other Revenue Other behavioral health care services accounted for 7.0% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. This portion of our business primarily consists of our contract management business and a managed care plan in Puerto Rico. Our contract management business involves the development, organization and management of behavioral health and rehabilitation programs within medical/surgical hospitals. Services provided are recorded as revenue at contractually determined rates in the period the services are rendered, provided that collectability of such amounts is reasonably assured. Results of Operations The following table illustrates our consolidated results of operations from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations, Consolidated Psychiatric Solutions For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Amount % Amount % Amount % Revenue $ 1,805,361 100.0 % $ 1,696,116 100.0 % $ 1,414,700 100.0 % Salaries, wages, and employee benefits (including share based compensation of $17,505, $19,913 and $16,104 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively) 1,005,204 55.7 % 938,363 55.3 % 787,301 55.7 % Professional fees 166,785 9.2 % 162,491 9.6 % 135,803 9.6 % Supplies 92,572 5.1 % 92,393 5.5 % 77,738 5.5 % Provision for doubtful accounts 36,414 2.0 % 34,334 2.0 % 27,343 1.9 % Other operating expenses 192,999 10.7 % 183,615 10.8 % 151,717 10.7 % Depreciation and amortization 44,778 2.5 % 38,843 2.3 % 30,113 2.1 % Interest expense, net 71,549 4.0 % 75,982 4.5 % 73,887 5.2 % Other expenses: Loss on refinancing long term debt 0.0 % 0.0 % 8,179 0.6 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes 195,060 10.8 % 170,095 10.0 % 122,619 8.7 % Provision for income taxes 74,889 4.1 % 64,457 3.8 % 46,200 3.3 % Income from continuing operations 120,171 6.7 % 105,638 6.2 % 76,419 5.4 % Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (93 ) 0.0 % (604 ) 0.0 % (285 ) 0.0 % Income from continuing operations attributable to PSI stockholders $ 120,078 6.7 % $ 105,034 6.2 % $ 76,134 5.4 % Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared To Year Ended December 31, 2008 The following table compares key total facility statistics and same facility statistics for 2009 and 2008 for owned and leased inpatient facilities: Year Ended December 31, % 2009 2008 Change Total facility results: Revenue (in thousands) $ 1,678,449 $ 1,571,141 6.8 % Number of facilities at period end 94 91 3.3 % Admissions 177,967 163,616 8.8 % Patient days 2,881,063 2,749,658 4.8 % Average length of stay 16.2 16.8 3.6 % Revenue per patient day $ 583 $ 571 2.1 % Same facility results: Revenue (in thousands) $ 1,654,258 $ 1,571,141 5.3 % Number of facilities at period end 91 91 0.0 % Admissions 174,874 163,616 6.9 % Patient days 2,845,536 2,749,658 3.5 % Average length of stay 16.3 16.8 3.0 % Revenue per patient day $ 581 $ 571 1.8 % Revenue. Revenue from continuing operations increased $109.2 million, or 6.4%, to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased $107.3 million, or 6.8%, to $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities relates primarily to same facility growth in patient days of 3.5% and revenue per patient day of 1.8%. Other revenue was $126.9 million in 2009 compared to $125.0 million in 2008. Salaries, wages, and employee benefits. Salaries, wages and employee benefits (SWB) expense was $1.0 billion in 2009 compared to $938.4 million in 2008, an increase of $66.8 million, or 7.1%. SWB expense includes $17.5 million and $19.9 million of shared based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on our stock option and 24 Table of Contents restricted stock grants outstanding at December 31, 2009, we estimate remaining unrecognized share based compensation expense to be approximately $31.3 million with a weighted average remaining amortization period of 2.1 years. Excluding share based compensation expense, SWB expense was $987.7 million, or 54.7% of total revenue, in 2009 compared to $918.5 million, or 54.2% of total revenue, in 2008. SWB expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $905.5 million in 2009, or 53.9% of revenue. Same facility SWB expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $891.9 million in 2009, or 53.9% of revenue, compared to $842.5 million in 2008, or 53.6% of revenue. This increase in same facility SWB expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities is primarily the result of a shift from utilization of contract labor included in professional fees to the utilization of employees and an increase in health insurance claims for health insurance coverage for our employees and their dependents. SWB expense for other operations was $48.5 million in 2009 compared to $49.0 million in 2008. SWB expense for our corporate office was $51.2 million, including $17.5 million in share based compensation, for 2009 compared to $46.4 million, including $19.9 million in share based compensation, for 2008. This increase in SWB for our corporate office primarily relates to the increase in corporate employees to support our operations and an increase in incentive compensation expense. Professional fees. Professional fees were $166.8 million in 2009, or 9.2% of total revenue, compared to $162.5 million in 2008, or 9.6% of total revenue. Professional fees for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $150.3 million in 2009, or 9.0% of revenue. Same facility professional fees for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $148.3 million in 2009, or 9.0% of revenue, compared to $142.9 million in 2008, or 9.1% of revenue. Professional fees for other operations and our corporate office decreased to $16.5 million in 2009 compared to $19.5 million in 2008. Supplies. Supplies expense was $92.6 million in 2009, or 5.1% of total revenue, compared to $92.4 million in 2008, or 5.5% of total revenue. Supplies expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $91.9 million in 2009, or 5.5% of revenue. Same facility supplies expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $90.6 million in 2009, or 5.5% of revenue, compared to $91.6 million in 2008, or 5.8% of revenue. Provision for doubtful accounts. The provision for doubtful accounts was $36.4 million in 2009, or 2.0% of total revenue, compared to $34.3 million in 2008, or 2.0% of total revenue. The provision for doubtful accounts at owned and leased inpatient facilities comprised substantially all of our provision for doubtful accounts. Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of rent, utilities, insurance, travel, and repairs and maintenance expenses. Other operating expenses were $193.0 million in 2009, or 10.7% of total revenue, compared to $183.6 million in 2008, or 10.8% of total revenue. Other operating expenses for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $133.4 million in 2009, or 7.9% of revenue. Same facility other operating expenses for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $131.7 million in 2009, or 8.0% of revenue, compared to $131.8 million in 2008, or 8.4% of revenue. This decrease in other operating expenses as a percent of revenue is primarily a result of a normalization of professional and general liability reserve activity compared with 2008. Other operating expenses for other operations and our corporate office increased to $59.6 million in 2009 compared to $51.6 million in 2008. This increase in other operating expenses for other operations and our corporate office was primarily the result of claims expense from a new at risk contract within our managed care plan in Puerto Rico. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $44.8 million in 2009 compared to $38.8 million in 2008, primarily as a result of depreciation on expansion projects at existing inpatient facilities and facilities acquired/opened in 2008 and 2009. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased to $71.5 million in 2009 compared to $76.0 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in interest rates on our variable rate debt. Income attributable to noncontrolling interest. We own controlling interests in two joint ventures that own two of our inpatient behavioral health care facilities. Income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the pro rata portion of each joint ventures net profit belonging to the noncontrolling partner. Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes. The loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax effect, was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $81,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2009, we completed the sale of our EAP business, elected to close and make The Oaks Treatment Center and Cumberland Hall of Chattanooga available for sale, and terminated one contract with a South Carolina juvenile justice agency. We also elected to close and make Nashville Rehabilitation Hospital available for sale and transferred its behavioral health services to Rolling Hills Hospital in the first quarter of 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we elected to dispose of a leased inpatient facility and terminate two contracts with a Puerto Rican juvenile justice agency to manage inpatient facilities. Accordingly, these operations are included in discontinued operations. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared To Year Ended December 31, 2007 The following table compares key total facility statistics and same facility statistics for 2008 and 2007 for owned and leased inpatient facilities. 25 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, % 2008 2007 Change Total facility results: Revenue (in thousands) $ 1,571,141 $ 1,314,203 19.6 % Number of facilities at period end 91 86 5.8 % Admissions 163,616 138,454 18.2 % Patient days 2,749,658 2,406,368 14.3 % Average length of stay 16.8 17.4 3.4 % Revenue per patient day $ 571 $ 546 4.6 % Same facility results: Revenue (in thousands) $ 1,419,904 $ 1,309,453 8.4 % Number of facilities at period end 86 86 0.0 % Admissions 144,563 137,830 4.9 % Patient days 2,472,292 2,399,812 3.0 % Average length of stay 17.1 17.4 1.7 % Revenue per patient day $ 574 $ 546 5.1 % Revenue. Revenue from continuing operations increased $281.4 million, or 19.9%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities increased $256.9 million, or 19.6%, to $1.6 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities relates primarily to the acquisitions of Horizon Health in 2007 and five inpatient facilities from UMC in 2008. The remainder of the increase in revenue from owned and leased inpatient facilities is primarily attributable to same facility growth in patient days of 3.0% and revenue per patient day of 5.1%. Other revenue was $125.0 million in 2008 compared to $100.5 million in 2007, an increase of $24.5 million, resulting primarily from the management contract business purchased in the Horizon Health acquisition. Salaries, wages, and employee benefits. SWB expense was $938.4 million in 2008 compared to $787.3 million in 2007, an increase of $151.1 million, or 19.2%. SWB expense includes $19.9 million and $16.1 million of shared based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Excluding share based compensation expense, SWB expense was $918.5 million, or 54.2% of total revenue, in 2008 compared to $771.2 million, or 54.5% of total revenue, in 2007. SWB expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $843.0 million in 2008, or 53.7% of revenue. Same facility SWB expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $759.3 million in 2008, or 53.5% of revenue, compared to $707.3 million in 2007, or 54.0% of revenue. SWB expense for other operations increased to $49.0 million in 2008 compared to $35.1 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the management contract business purchased in the Horizon Health acquisition. SWB expense for our corporate office was $46.4 million, including $19.9 million in share based compensation, for 2008 compared to $41.5 million, including $16.1 million in share based compensation, for 2007. Professional fees. Professional fees were $162.5 million in 2008, or 9.6% of total revenue, compared to $135.8 million in 2007, or 9.6% of total revenue. Professional fees for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $143.0 million in 2008, or 9.1% of revenue. Same facility professional fees for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $128.2 million in 2008, or 9.0% of revenue, compared to $120.8 million in 2007, or 9.2% of revenue. Professional fees for other operations and our corporate office increased to $19.5 million in 2008 compared to $14.2 million in 2007, primarily due to the other operations acquired in the Horizon Health acquisition. Supplies. Supplies expense was $92.4 million in 2008, or 5.5% of total revenue, compared to $77.7 million in 2007, or 5.5% of total revenue. Supplies expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $91.6 million in 2008, or 5.8% of revenue. Same facility supplies expense for owned and leased inpatient facilities was $81.2 million in 2008, or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $76.7 million in 2007, or 5.9% of revenue. Supplies expense for other operations as well as our corporate office consisted primarily of office supplies and is negligible to our supplies expense overall. Provision for doubtful accounts. The provision for doubtful accounts was $34.3 million in 2008, or 2.0% of total revenue, compared to $27.3 million in 2007, or 1.9% of total revenue. The provision for doubtful accounts at owned and leased inpatient facilities comprised substantially all of our provision for doubtful accounts. Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of rent, utilities, insurance, travel, and repairs and maintenance expenses. Other operating expenses were $183.6 million in 2008, or 10.8% of total revenue, compared to $151.7 million in 2007, or 10.7% of total revenue. Other operating expenses for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $132.0 million in 2008, or 8.4% of revenue. Same facility other operating expenses for owned and leased inpatient facilities were $118.2 million in 2008, or 8.3% of revenue, compared to $104.3 million in 2007, or 8.0% of revenue. The increase in same facility other operating expenses for owned and leased inpatient facilities was primarily the result of an increase in our self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks, which is primarily due to the revised assessment of certain claims at amounts higher than originally anticipated and the 26 Table of Contents actuarial implications of such revisions. Other operating expenses for other operations and our corporate office increased to $51.6 million in 2008 compared to $46.3 million in 2007, primarily due to the management contract business purchased in the Horizon Health acquisition. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $38.8 million in 2008 compared to $30.1 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of inpatient facilities and capital expenditures during 2007 and 2008. Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased to $76.0 million in 2008 compared to $73.9 million in 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in our long term debt offset by a reduction in our overall effective interest rate. We borrowed $443.2 million in May 2007 to finance the Horizon Health acquisition and borrowed $149.3 million in 2008 to finance the acquisition of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from UMC, acquisitions of EAP businesses that were later moved to discontinued operations, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. In February 2009, as part of an amendment to our revolving credit facility, the interest rate margins on borrowings based on LIBOR were increased to a range of 5.0% to 5.75% depending upon a certain leverage ratio. This interest rate margin was 1.5% at December 31, 2008. For further information on the February 2009 amendment to our revolving credit facility, see Liquidity and Capital Resources within this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Income attributable to noncontrolling interest. During 2008 and 2007, we owned a controlling interest in a joint venture that owned one of our inpatient behavioral health care facilities. Income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the pro rata portion of each joint ventures net profit belonging to the noncontrolling partner. Loss on refinancing of long term debt. During 2007 we incurred a loss on refinancing long term debt of $8.2 million that consisted primarily of the amount above par value we paid to repurchase our 105/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (105/8 Notes), the write off of capitalized financing costs associated with our 105/8% Notes and the amount paid to exit the related interest rate swap agreements. (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. The loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax effect, was $81,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to income from discontinued operations, net of income tax effect, of $74,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. During 2009, we completed the sale of our EAP business, elected to close and make The Oaks Treatment Center and Cumberland Hall of Chattanooga available for sale, and terminated one contract with a South Carolina juvenile justice agency. We also elected to close and make Nashville Rehabilitation Hospital available for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we elected to dispose of a leased inpatient facility and recorded a $1.9 million write down to fair value of the assets held for sale for this facility. Additionally, two contracts with a Puerto Rican juvenile justice agency to manage inpatient facilities were terminated in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we elected to dispose of one inpatient facility. Accordingly these operations are included in discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources We currently have $295.7 million available for borrowings under our $300 million revolving credit facility. Additionally, our cash flow from continuing operating activities was $205.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and we had $177.9 million of working capital at December 31, 2009. We believe that our cash flow from operations, revolving credit facility availability and working capital are sufficient to fund our known future cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures. We historically spend approximately 2% to 3% of our revenue on routine capital expenditures and currently have plans for construction projects with expected costs of approximately $57 million over the next year, which will add approximately 300 new beds to our inpatient facilities. As part of our long term growth strategy we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient behavioral health care facilities and other operations as well as incur expenditures for the expansion of our inpatient facilities. Management continually assesses our capital needs and, should the need arise, we will seek additional financing, including debt or equity, to fund potential acquisitions, facility expansions, repayment of indebtedness or for other corporate purposes. In negotiating such financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us. Failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities or expand our facilities. Working capital at December 31, 2009 was $177.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 million, compared to working capital of $233.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million, at December 31, 2008. The $44.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily a result of principal payments in excess of borrowings to reduce debt by $127.9 million, cash used for acquisitions of $32.9 million and capital expenditures of $150.0 million, offset by cash provided by continuing operations of $205.4 million and cash received on the sale of our EAP business of $68.5 million, net of fees and expenses. The net reduction in debt included a $229.3 million reduction in our revolving credit facility such that there was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2009, thereby increasing our borrowing availability to $295.7 million from $63.9 million at December 31, 2008. Working capital includes net current assets held for sale of discontinued operations totaling $19.3 million and $72.3 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the net current assets held for sale included assets and liabilities of 27 Table of Contents our EAP business that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2009 for approximately $68.5 million, net of fees and expenses. Excluding net current assets held for sale of discontinued operations, working capital was $158.6 million and $161.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This change in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable of $8.0 million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $19.0 million to purchase a hospital building previously leased and current maturities under our revolving credit facility of $29.3 million, offset by decreases in cash of $44.5 million, income tax receivable of $6.3 million and deferred tax assets of $4.5 million, and an increase in accrued interest expense of $4.8 million. Cash provided by continuing operating activities was $205.4 million in 2009 compared to $139.3 million in 2008. The increase in cash flows from continuing operating activities was primarily the result of cash provided by improved operating results, improved collections on accounts receivable and a reduction in payments for income taxes and interest. Income tax payments decreased to $49.9 million in 2009 compared to $68.1 million in 2008, primarily as a result of applying income tax overpayments for 2008 to income taxes due for 2009. Interest payments decreased to $62.0 million in 2009 compared to $79.8 million in 2008, primarily due to decreasing interest rates on our variable rate debt and timing of interest payments. During 2009, the balance of accounts receivable increased $3.9 million, net of acquisitions, compared to an increase of $17.8 million, net of acquisitions, during 2008, primarily as a result of improved collections on our accounts receivables. The increase in the balance of accounts receivable, net of acquisitions, during 2008 was primarily the result of post acquisition receivables generated in 2008 from the five facilities acquired from UMC in March 2008, for which no accounts receivable were purchased. Our consolidated days sales outstanding were 49 and 52 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Billings for patient accounts receivable are generally submitted to the payor within three days of the patients discharge or completion of services. Interim billings may be utilized for patients with extended lengths of stay. We verify within a reasonable period of time that claims submitted to third party payors have been received and are being processed by such payors. Follow up regarding the status of each claim is made on a periodic basis until payment on the claim is received. Billing notices for self pay accounts receivable are distributed on a periodic basis. Self pay accounts receivable are turned over to collection agencies once internal collection efforts have been exhausted. Accounts receivable under our inpatient management contracts are billed at least monthly. Follow up collection efforts are made on a periodic basis until payment is received. Our allowance for doubtful accounts for patient receivables primarily consists of patient accounts that are greater than 180 days past the patients discharge date. Our allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables due under our inpatient management contracts primarily consists of amounts that are specifically identified as potential collection issues. Accounts receivable are not written off until collection within a reasonable period of time is deemed unlikely. Cash used by continuing investing activities was $181.7 million in 2009 compared to $244.4 million in 2008. Cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily consisted of $130.7 million paid for purchases of fixed assets, $32.9 million paid for acquisitions and $19.3 million paid for the acquisition of the real estate of previously leased facilities. Cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately $53.3 million and $77.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. We expect expansion expenditures to continue during 2010 as a result of planned capital expansion projects and the construction of new facilities, which are expected to add approximately 300 new beds to our inpatient facilities. We define expansion capital expenditures as those that increase the capacity of our facilities or otherwise enhance revenue. Routine or maintenance capital expenditures were 3.0% of our net revenue for 2009. Cash provided by discontinued investing activities in 2009 primarily consisted of $68.5 million in proceeds from the sale of our EAP business, net of fees and expenses. Cash used in continuing investing activities in 2008 consisted primarily of $121.2 million in cash paid for acquisitions and $121.9 million paid for purchases of fixed assets. Acquisitions in 2008 consisted primarily of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities acquired from UMC. Cash used in discontinued investing activities in 2008 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of EAP businesses. Cash used in financing activities was $136.8 million in 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $155.7 million in 2008. Cash used in financing activities for 2009 consisted primarily of $229.3 million of net payments on our revolving credit facility, $9.9 million paid for loan and issuance costs and $5.1 million principal payments on long term debt, offset by $106.5 million received from the issuance of $120 million of our 73/4% Notes at a discount of 11.25%. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily resulted from $149.3 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility used to finance the acquisition of five inpatient behavioral health care facilities from UMC and certain EAP acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. We have filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 and an acquisition shelf registration statement on Form S 4. The universal shelf registration statement permits us to sell, in one or more public offerings, an indeterminate amount of our common stock, common stock warrants, preferred stock and debt securities, or any combination of such securities, at prices and on terms satisfactory to us. The acquisition shelf registration statement enables us to issue up to 5 million shares of our common stock in one or more business combination transactions, including acquisitions by us of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. To date, no securities have been issued pursuant to either registration statement. 28 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt (1): Senior Credit Facility: Senior secured term loan facility, expiring on July 1, 2012 and bearing interest of 2.0% at December 31, 2009 $ 564,875 $ 3,750 $ 561,125 $ $ 7 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2015 582,666 582,666 Mortgage loans on facilities, maturing in 2036, 2037 and 2038 bearing fixed interest rates of 5.7% to 7.6% 32,850 450 988 1,118 30,294 1,180,391 4,200 562,113 1,118 612,960 Lease and other obligations 86,786 14,872 20,988 14,410 36,516 Total contractual obligations $ 1,267,177 $ 19,072 $ 583,101 $ 15,528 $ 649,476 (1) Excludes capital lease obligations and other obligations of $6.7 million, which are included in lease and other obligations. The fair value of our $470.0 million in principal amount of 73/4% Notes was approximately $453.6 million and $343.7 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The fair value of our $120.0 million in principal amount of 73/4% Notes issued in May 2009 was approximately $111.6 million as of December 31, 2009. The fair value of our senior secured term loan facility was approximately $536.6 million as of December 31, 2009. The fair values of our revolving credit facility and senior secured term loan facility were approximately $195.5 million and $446.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The carrying value of our other long term debt, including current maturities, of $39.5 million and $40.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, approximated fair value. We had $564.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our senior secured term loan facility as of December 31, 2009. At our December 31, 2009 borrowing level, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately $0.7 million. Impact of Inflation and Economic Trends Although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations, the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are supply costs, which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases. Some of the freestanding owned, leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market, including a shortage of nurses, which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our SWB expense in excess of the inflation rate. Although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases, management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies, labor management and reasonable price increases, the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable. Our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws which have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans, our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non Medicare patients is limited. The behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession, erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending. However, our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payors. Discussion concerning the current economic downturn is included in Part I, Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors. We are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available, the results of which form the basis of such estimates. While we believe our estimation processes are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows. 29 Table of Contents The primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid, but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date. We continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts. Significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows. The primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues. As with our patient receivables, we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts. Allowances for Contractual Discounts The Medicare and Medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation. We estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis by comparing our established billing rates with the amount we determine to be reimbursable given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. Most payments are determined based on negotiated per diem rates. While the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates, these differences are deemed immaterial. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management. We periodically compare the contractual rates on our patient accounting systems with the Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates or the third party payor contract for accuracy. We also monitor the adequacy of our contractual adjustments using financial measures such as comparing cash receipts to net patient revenue adjusted for bad debt expense. As of December 31, 2009, our patient accounts receivable balance for third party payors was $235.0 million. A theoretical 1% change in the amounts due from third party payors at December 31, 2009 could have an after tax effect of approximately $1.5 million on our financial position and results of operations. The following table presents the percentage by payor of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and related accounts receivable at year end: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Net Revenue Accounts Receivable Net Revenue Accounts Receivable Medicaid 29 % 24 % 30 % 26 % Commercial/HMO/Private Pay 37 % 42 % 36 % 41 % Medicare 14 % 12 % 13 % 10 % State agency 15 % 16 % 15 % 17 % Other 5 % 6 % 6 % 6 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % The following table presents the percentage by aging category of our accounts receivable at December 31, 2009 and 2008: At December 31, 2009 2008 0 30 days 64 % 64 % 31 60 days 14 % 13 % 61 90 days 8 % 8 % 91 120 days 5 % 5 % 121 150 days 3 % 4 % 151 180 days 3 % 4 % 180 days 3 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % Our consolidated days sales outstanding were 49 and 52 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our consolidated collections as a percentage of net revenue less bad debt expense was 101.5% and 99.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Professional and General Liability We are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide. Our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of $3.0 million with an insured excess limit of $75.0 million. The self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are estimated based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary. This estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. We have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention. While claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often limits timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. Income Taxes As part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences. The tax effects of future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet. Management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and, if necessary, estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity. To the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity, then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price. In order to apply GAAP, we are required to make significant judgments regarding the recognition and measurement of each tax position. Changes in these judgments may materially affect the estimate of our effective tax rate and our operating results. Share Based Compensation We record share based compensation expense for the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such awards. We utilize the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options. The Black Scholes model includes certain variables and assumptions that require judgment, such as the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected term of our stock options. Additionally, judgment is in the estimation of forfeitures over the vesting period of share based awards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. With respect to our interest bearing liabilities, approximately $615.5 million of our long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of 8.0%. Our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility, which had $564.9 million outstanding at December 31, 2009 and on which interest is generally payable at LIBOR plus 1.75%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately $0.7 million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at December 31, 2009. In the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and or interest rates change significantly, we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change by targeting a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates and periodically entering into interest rate swap agreements. Information on quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.
