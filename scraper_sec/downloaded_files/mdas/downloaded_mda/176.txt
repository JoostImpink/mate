ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the worlds leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description, production enhancement and reservoir management products and services to the oil and gas industry, primarily through customer relationships with many of the worlds major, national and independent oil companies. Our business units have been aggregated into three complementary segments: Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, fluid and gas samples. We provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry. Production Enhancement: Includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulations and production. We provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. Reservoir Management: Combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs. In April 2004, we sold our specialized geophysical and seismic related business, which was previously included as a component of our Reservoir Management business. We recorded a loss of $15.7 million, net of tax, related to this discontinued operation during the year ended December 31, 2004. General Overview We provide services and design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in exploration and development efforts to explore new fields or to increase productivity in existing fields. Our clients investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Accordingly, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products. Commodity prices for crude oil fluctuated throughout 2006 ending the year down from levels attained earlier in the year. However, activity levels in the oilfield service sector increased during the year. The following table summarizes the average worldwide and U.S. rig counts for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as well as the spot price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude and an mcf of natural gas at the dates then ended: Rig Count/Oil and Gas Prices As of December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Worldwide Rig Count1 3,125 2,993 2,555 U.S. Rig Count1 1,718 1,470 1,246 Crude Oil Price per Barrel (WTI Spot) $ 60.85 $ 59.82 $ 43.36 Natural Gas Price Spot Average per MCF2 $ 5.51 $ 9.52 $ 6.15 1) Baker Hughes Incorporated World wide Rig Count 2) Obtained from Lehman Brothers U.S. Department of Energy Henry Hub spot price at 12/29/06, 12/30/05 & 12/30/04 per the New York Mercantile Exchange The price of natural gas in 2006 declined throughout the year when compared with the price in 2005 and 2004. These lower prices were attributable to various market factors including a general decline in natural gas consumption. General oil market conditions in the United States improved and contributed to maintaining the price for derivative crude oil products and petrochemical products in 2006. Our activity levels continue to increase as oilfield activities by our customers increase. These higher activity levels resulted in increased revenues for us in 2006, primarily for our Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement business segments. Given these higher revenues, in conjunction with efforts to contain our cost structure, we were able to generate operating income that was 102% greater than the prior year. Our Reservoir Description segment showed improvement in almost all operations, primarily as a result of the spending levels of our clients aimed at characterizing and analyzing reservoirs, crude oil, and derivative products. Operating income from our Production Enhancement segment was up 89% over the prior year as more wells in North America were drilled and stimulated than in the prior year, which provides greater opportunity for our clients to use our products and services. In April 2004, we sold our seismic related business, which had become less profitable in recent years, due to increased competition which contributed to lower margins. The results for our Reservoir Management group improved over the prior year due primarily to a re focus of our efforts on integrated solutions for clients. Outlook We continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines. We believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service customers who have global operations in addition to the national oil companies. We have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions. Based on discussions with our clients and our view of the industry, we anticipate that in 2007 spending by our clients will increase approximately 10%. Attaining our internal targets is dependent on sustained oilfield activity. We expect to meet ongoing working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and funding of our share repurchase program from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP") and require us to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation which requires judgment. Our accounting policies and procedures are explained in Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2006: Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred. All advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are performed or product title is transferred. We recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed. All known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently. Training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate. Based on our review, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable as a whole. Our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2006 was $4.3 million compared to $4.5 million at December 31, 2005. Long Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective assets remaining useful life. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. When long lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. Property, plant and equipment held and used is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable over the remaining service life. Indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use or significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located. Provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the net book value of the assets, or carrying value, is determined to be unrecoverable and the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets, calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The calculation of fair value requires estimates of future cash flows, and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. We did not record impairment charges related to our long lived assets held for use in continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. We review our goodwill, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations, at least annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs which may indicate impairment during the year. We evaluated assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill and certain intangible assets, for impairment comparing the fair value of our reportable segments to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date, after excluding inter company transactions and allocating corporate assets to the reportable segments. Fair value is determined by projecting future cash flows on a discounted basis. If the carrying value of the reportable segment exceeds the fair value determined, impairment may be indicated. If impairment is indicated, the fair value of the reportable segment would be determined. Any remaining goodwill would be deemed impaired and charged to income during the period the impairment was identified. Any subsequent impairment loss c ould result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations. Inventory Valuation Allowances Our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical regional sales trends, and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory. Should these assumptions and judgments not occur, our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results. Our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory. Our valuation reserve for inventory at December 31, 2006 was $2.5 million compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2005. If we over or underestimate demand for inventory, it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations. Income Taxes Our income tax expense includes income taxes of The Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated $7.7 million and $13.8 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a m aterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Stock Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R, "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R") SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended December 31, 2006 included: (a) compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", and (b) compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Results from prior periods have not been restated. This statement requires compensation costs related to share based payments, including stock options, to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations based on their fair values. Th e expense is recognized over the requisite service period of the award. We previously recognized expense for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and related interpretations ("APB 25"). Accordingly, compensation expense was recognized for the excess, if any, of the stock price on the grant date over the option exercise price. No compensation expense was recorded under APB 25 for awards granted under our employee stock option plan as all options issued had exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The pro forma effects upon net income and earnings per share for stock options are disclosed below per SFAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following table summarizes key estimates and assumptions used to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2 006, 2005 and 2004. Account Nature of Estimates Required Assumptions Used Allowance for doubtful accounts We evaluate whether client receivables are collectible. See "Allowance for Doubtful Accounts." Inventory reserves We forecast client demand, considering changes in technology which could result in obsolescence. See "Inventory Valuation Allowances." Depreciation and amortization We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets. Useful lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective assets useful life and salvage value. These assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We utilize an actuary to determine the value of the projected benefit obligation under a Dutch pension plan. This valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality, future pay increases and discount rate used to value our obligations. In addition, we recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates. The actuarial assumptions used are based upon professional judgment and historical experience, including trends in mortality rates, and credit market rates (discount rate). Stock based compensation We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. In addition, we derive a forfeiture rate that is used in calculating the expense for these awards. See "Stock Based Compensation." Comparisons to either our stock price, a return on our stock price compared to certain stock indices or a return on equity calculation. Income taxes We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry forwards). See "Income Taxes." We examine our historical and projected operating results, review the eligible carry forward period and tax planning opportunities and consider other relevant information. Changes in tax laws for the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly impact our estimates. Long lived assets, intangibles and goodwill We evaluate the recoverability of our assets periodically, but at least annually, by examining current and projected operating results to identify any triggering events, which may indicate impairment. We compare the carrying value of the assets to a projection of fair value, utilizing judgment as to the identification of reporting units, the allocation of corporate assets amongst reporting units and the determination of the appropriate discount rate. See "Long Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill." Our impairment analysis is subjective and includes estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than normal operating leases, we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles, synthetic leases or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements. Results of Operations Results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenues are as follows (dollars in thousands): Year Ended % Change REVENUES: 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Services $ 430,118 74.7% $ 367,401 76.0% $ 329,511 77.1% 17.1% 11.5% Product Sales 145,571 25.3% 116,066 24.0% 97,916 22.9% 25.4% 18.5% 575,689 100.0% 483,467 100.0% 427,427 100.0% 19.1% 13.1% OPERATING EXPENSES: Cost of services* 300,663 69.9% 277,423 75.5% 256,202 77.8% 8.4% 8.3% Cost of sales* 106,436 73.1% 90,700 78.1% 80,190 81.9% 17.3% 13.1% Total cost of services and sales 407,099 70.7% 368,123 76.1% 336,392 78.7% 10.6% 9.4% General and administrative expenses 33,082 5.7% 37,846 7.8% 28,140 6.6% (12.6)% 34.5% Depreciation and amortization 17,275 3.0% 16,376 3.4% 17,142 4.0% 5.5% (4.5)% Other expense (income), net (5,324) (0.9)% 191 % (761) (0.2)% NM (125.1)% OPERATING INCOME 123,557 21.5% 60,931 12.6% 46,514 10.9% 102.8% 31.0% Debt prepayment charge % 6,012 1.2% % (100.0)% 100.0% Interest expense 5,805 1.0% 8,277 1.7% 8,275 1.9% (29.9)% % Income before income tax expense 117,752 20.5% 46,642 9.6% 38,239 8.9% 152.5% 22.0% Income tax expense 35,090 6.1% 14,925 3.1% 10,217 2.4% 135.1% 46.1% Income from continuing operations 82,662 14.4% 31,717 6.6% 28,022 6.6% 160.7% 13.2% Discontinued operations % (506) (0.1)% (15,732) (3.7)% (100.0)% NM NET INCOME $ 82,662 14.4% $ 31,211 6.5% $ 12,290 2.9% 164.9% 154.0% *Percentage based on applicable revenue rather than total revenue. "NM" means not meaningful. Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 We evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenues, operating income margin (defined as operating income divided by total revenue) and income margin (defined as income from continuing operations divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, increases in revenues generally translate into higher operating income margin and income margin percentages. Results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are summarized in the following chart: Service Revenues Service revenues increased to $430.1 million for 2006 from $367.4 million for 2005 and $329.5 million for 2004. These year over year increases in service revenues were largely attributable to an overall increase in worldwide oilfield activities and acceptance of recently introduced services by our customers. The worldwide operating rig count increased to 3,125 at December 31, 2006 from 2,993 and 2,555 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as derived from published reports from Baker Hughes Incorporated. This overall increase in drilling related activity created greater demand for our services. As in 2005, our revenues increased in 2006 primarily as a result of greater demand across all three business segments from increased oilfield activities in North America, Europe, West Africa and the Far East. Product Sale Revenues Product sale revenues increased to $145.6 million for 2006 from $116.1 million for 2005 and $97.9 million for 2004. These incremental improvements in revenue were consistent with the higher revenues we experienced for our services, a 25% year over year increase for the period ended December 31, 2006. The continuing increases we have realized were primarily the result of increased drilling activity on a global basis, but more specifically for natural gas in the North American markets which resulted in higher demand for our well completion products along with the acceptance of new products and technologies we have recently introduced to the market. Cost of Services Cost of services increased to $300.7 million for 2006 from $277.4 million for 2005 and $256.2 million for 2004. When 2006 is compared to 2005 as a percentage of service revenue, cost of services decreased from 75.5% to 69.9%. The decline in the cost of services relative to service revenue was primarily a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure. Incremental margins are calculated as the change in operating income divided by the change in revenues. For 2005 compared to 2004, as a percentage of service revenue, cost of services decreased by two percentage points. This decrease was primarily a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure. Cost of Sales Cost of sales increased to $106.4 million for 2006 from $90.7 million for 2005 and $80.2 million for 2004. As a percentage of product sale revenues, cost of sales decreased to 73.1% for 2006 compared to 78.1% for 2005 and 81.9% for 2004. The improvement in margin for 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 was largely attributable to the growing demand for our new technologies which are our higher margin products, from an overall increase in sales, continued efforts to enhance our manufacturing efficiencies and improved inventory management. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operating subsidiaries. Our general and administrative expenses decreased $4.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to an additional charge related to our stock based compensation plans in 2005. This additional charge contributed to the $9.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 as well as higher accounting fees of $1.0 million relating to the implementation of Rule 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and various other elements. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.9 million in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures as we continue to grow the company. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.8 million in 2005 compared to 2004. This decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a general run off of depreciation expense associated with older assets offset by an increase in capital expenditures in 2005. Other Expense (Income), Net The components of other expense (income), net, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended 2006 2005 2004 Minority interest $ 120 $ (57) $ 1 (Gain) loss on sale of assets (755) (293) 550 Equity in loss (income) of affiliates 123 (36) 265 Foreign exchange (gain) loss (1,443) 1,619 (788) Interest income (457) (402) (189) Gain on involuntary sale of asset (375) (875) Gain on insurance recovery (492) (334) Other (2,045) 569 (600) Total other expense (income), net $ (5,324) $ 191 $ (761) In 2003, the British government notified us that it would exercise its right of eminent domain thereby involuntarily acquiring the property of one of our operating facilities. Prior to December 31, 2003, we received an initial payment from the British government for $0.6 million as compensation for this property. In the second quarter of 2005, we negotiated and received a settlement which resulted in a $0.9 million gain. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we received a final settlement which resulted in a $0.4 million gain in excess of the gain recorded in 2005. During the first quarter of 2005, a building at our manufacturing plant in Godley, Texas, was damaged by fire, resulting in the loss of the building, some inventory, as well as other business equipment and supplies. In June 2005, we filed claims with our insurance carrier for reimbursement of these costs resulting in a gain of $0.3 million. In addition, we filed a claim for business interruption costs and the final settlement was reached in the first quarter of 2006, which resulted in a gain of $0.5 million in excess of the gain recorded in 2005. Debt Prepayment Charge In December 2005, we repaid our Senior Notes. In connection with the early prepayment, we incurred a prepayment penalty of $6.0 million. See "Credit Facilities and Available Future Liquidity". Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $2.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005, due to the refinancing of our debt positions over the past year in which we utilized our revolving credit facility to extinguish our senior notes which bore an average interest rate of 8.16% at the end of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006 we issued senior exchangeable debt securities at 0.25% which the proceeds were used to pay off our credit facility at which time bore an average interest rate of 6.00% for the period outstanding in 2006. Interest expense remained basically unchanged in 2005 compared to 2004, due to higher borrowing rates under our long term revolving credit facility, which increased to an average of 4.40% for 2005 compared to an average of 2.95% for 2004, which was offset by a lower outstanding balance. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $20.2 million in 2006 compared to 2005. This change was due to an increase in income before income taxes of $71.1 million off set by a decrease in the effective tax rate for the year. Income tax expense increased $4.7 million in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was due to an increase in income before income taxes of $8.5 million coupled with an increase in the effective tax rate for the year. The effective tax rate was 29.8% for 2006, 32.0% for 2005 and 26.7 % for 2004. In 2006, we released approximately $6.1 million of the valuation allowance due to an increase in tax profits which was primarily offset by an increase in our provision for tax controversies in various jurisdictions. The change in the 2005 tax rate from 2004 is primarily a result in a change in activity levels between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Discontinued Operations As a result of the sale of our seismic business in April 2004, we recorded a loss for discontinued operations totaling $15.7 million, net of tax. This loss included charges related to the impairment of goodwill, certain intangible assets and other long lived assets totaling $11.2 million and a charge of $1.2 million to the provision for doubtful accounts, as well as other working capital adjustments. In 2005, we finalized the terms under the contract for sale of the business through a negotiated payment of $0.5 million, net of taxes. Segment Analysis The following charts and tables summarize the operating results for our three complementary business segments.

Calculated by dividing "Operating Income" by "Revenue". Reservoir Description Revenues for our Reservoir Description segment increased by 12.1% in 2006 compared to 2005, and grew 8.5% in 2005 compared to 2004. These revenue increases resulted from continued expansion of oilfield activities world wide and North American projects related to unconventional gas reservoirs. As in 2005, revenues for 2006 were also positively impacted by increased demand for our fluid characterization services in Europe and the U.S. For 2005 compared to 2004, we experienced an increase in demand for our reservoir rock analysis as well as our fluid analysis services in North America, West Africa, Middle East and the Far East. Operating income and operating income margin for the Reservoir Description segment increased due to continued growth of higher value added and consequently higher margin products which resulted in increases in margins throughout the majority of the regions with significant increases in Asia Pacific and the U.S. For 2005 compared to 2004, operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure. Increases in North America and Europe more than offset operating income declines in Mexico and certain regions of the former Soviet Union, where we continued to experience margin erosion due to increased competition. Production Enhancement Revenues for our Production Enhancement business segment grew 26.8% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the acceptance of recently introduced products and services coupled with a continued expansion in global drilling activities in 2006. With the increase in drilling activities, demand for our well perforating and completion products and diagnostic services has also increased, facilitated by the continued improvements in our technologies such as the Completion Profiler&trade;, GTX SPAN&trade; and HERO&trade;. Revenues grew 19.6% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to the introduction of new technology and to the increase in North America natural gas drilling activity in 2005 relative to 2004. With the increase in drilling activities, the demand for our well perforating and completion products and diagnostic services has also increased, the primary products and services offered by this segment. Operating income for this segment increased to $57.5 million in 2006 from $30.4 million in 2005, an increase of 89.0%. Operating income increased 56.2% to $30.4 million in 2005, up from $19.5 million in 2004. These continued improvements were due primarily to increased sales of higher margin services and products including new enhanced recovery technology, such as SpectraScan&trade;, SpectraStim&trade;, and Completion Profiler&trade;. Also, higher margin GTX SPAN&trade; casing patches and HERO&trade; perforating charges and gun systems increased with global demand, while improvements in manufacturing efficiencies resulted in higher productivity per employee and lower overall costs per unit. Additionally, the demand for our technology in fracture diagnostics continued to increase as drilling activity increased in unconventional gas reservoirs. Reservoir Management Revenues for our Reservoir Management segment increased by 41.3% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 24.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. The continued increase was due to higher revenue for multi client reservoir studies, especially studies pertaining to unconventional gas reservoirs, and increased international demand for our reservoir monitoring systems. Significant studies in 2006 and 2005 were Reservoir Characterization and Production Properties of Gas Shales and Geological, Petrophysical, and Geomechanical Properties of Tight Gas Sands and in 2004 they included A Regional Study of the Reservoir Lithologies from Fields and Basins in Libya, as well as Reservoir Quality, Reservoir Quality Prediction and Seal Rock Evaluation Deep Shelf Gulf of Mexico and several other proprietary studies. Operating income for this segment increased 107.7% in 2006 compared to 2005 and 55.9% in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to incremental margins earned from the continued expansion of the multi client reservoir study sales in the U.S. and expansion of studies being performed both onshore and offshore Libya. Liquidity and Capital Resources General We have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flow from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our share repurchase program. If necessary, we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions. As we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash flow is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us. We utilize the non GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before the impact of the debt prepayment charge, less capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash, in excess of capital expenditures, available to operate the business and fund non discretionary obligations. The following table reconciles this non GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Free Cash Flow Calculation (unaudited, in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations $ 120,305 $ 74,778 $ 54,196 Add: debt prepayment charge 6,012 Less: capital expenditures (24,415) (19,095) (10,888) Free cash flow $ 95,890 $ 61,695 $ 43,308 The increase in free cash flow in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 was due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily as a result of higher net income. Working capital was $136.6 million and $83.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash Flows The following table summarizes cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Continuing Operations 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 120,305 $ 74,778 $ 54,196 Investing activities (23,595) (16,364) (12,008) Financing activities (56,230) (60,701) (60,327) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 40,480 $ (2,287) $ (18,139) The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to an increase in net income, accounts receivable and current liabilities offset by a decrease in stock compensation. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for stock based compensation, debt refinancing charges, and the increase in long term deferred revenue from the sale of analysis studies. Cash flow used in investing activities increased $7.2 million in 2006 over 2005 due to an increase in capital expenditures for 2006 and a lower level of proceeds received from disposal of property. Capital expenditures made in 2006 were for replacement of in place equipment and for growth through additional equipment and instrumentation in growing markets. Cash flow used for investing activities increased $4.4 million in 2005 over 2004 due to an increase in capital expenditures for 2005 offset by no acquisitions being made and a higher level of proceeds received from disposal of property, principally as a result of a settlement we reached with the British government after they exercised their right of eminent domain over one of our locations. Capital expenditures made in 2005 were for replacement of in place equipment and for additional equipment and instrumentation in growing markets. Cash flow used in financing activities in 2006 was comparable to 2005 but decreased slightly overall. There were several significant financing activities conducted in 2006. In November 2006, we issued $300 million of exchangeable notes, and in connection with this transaction we purchased a call option hedge on the notes and issued a warrant on our stock. These transactions net of the debt financing costs generated cash flow of approximately $263 million. The net proceeds received from these transactions were primarily used on other financing activities, such as paying off the $100 million outstanding balance of our existing credit facility and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase program. In 2006, we repurchased 3,837,372 of our common shares at a cost of $251.1 million which was $209.6 million more than 2005. Additionally, cash received from exercised stock options and the tax benefit received from stock based payments was $12.9 mill ion greater in 2006 as compared to 2005. Cash flow used in financing activities increased in 2005 compared to 2004, as we paid down debt in 2005. Our financing activities reflected a net repayment of debt of $26.8 million in 2005 and $17.1 million in 2004. In 2005, we used $41.4 million to repurchase 1,468,515 shares of our common stock, while in 2004 we used $51.3 million to repurchase 2,378,500 shares of our common stock. This share repurchase program was approved by our shareholders in connection with our initial public offering in September 1995 and repurchases began on October 10, 2002. Under the program, we were authorized to repurchase up to 10% of our issued common shares. This authorization was extended by our shareholders at each of our annual meetings beginning in April 1996. At our June 2006 annual meeting of shareholders, we were authorized to cancel 2,476,997 of our repurchased shares, with a cost of $106.8 million. Pursuant to this authorization, these shares were cancelled during the second quarter of 2006. In addition, we were authorized to continue our share repurchase program of up to 10% of our issued common shares through December 28, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 3,837,372 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $251.1 million, or an average price of $65.43 per share. Subsequent to year end, we have repurchased the remaining authorized shares. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to finance future acquisitions. However, under the Dutch Commercial Code ("DCC"), we can only hold a maximum of 10% of our issued shares in treasury. Therefore, it may be necessary to cancel some or all of these shares to remain in compliance with the DCC. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $8.05 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $81.00 per share on December 31, 2006, an increase of over 906%. In 2004, we recorded a net cash inflow of $17.6 million as a result of our discontinued operations which included $18.2 million of proceeds from the sale of the specialized geophysical and seismic business and cash received from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit, partially offset by a use of operating cash flows. Credit Facilities and Available Future Liquidity On November 6, 2006 Core Laboratories LP, a wholly owned subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Exchangeable Notes due 2011 ("Notes") to qualified institutional buyers. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year and are guaranteed by Core Laboratories N.V. These notes are exchangeable into shares of Core Laboratories N.V. under certain circumstances at an initial conversion rate of 10.5533 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $94.76 per share. Upon exchange, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount, and any excess exchange value will be delivered in Core Laboratories N.V. common shares. On November 17, 2006, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional $50 million of the 0.25% senior exchangeable notes due 2011, increasing the aggregate issuance of such notes to $300 million. We sold the Notes to the initial purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A of the Secu rities Act and subsequently filed a registration statement on Form S 3, which became effective immediately, pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to resale of the notes and shares received in exchange for the notes on December 22, 2006. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per year payable semiannually on May 6 and November 6 of each year, beginning on May 6, 2007. Core Laboratories LP used proceeds of the offering to enter into exchangeable note hedge transactions with a financial institution which is an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers. The exchangeable note hedge transactions are designed to cover, subject to customary anti dilution adjustments, the net number of our common shares that would be deliverable to exchanging note holders in the event of an exchange of the notes. We paid an aggregate amount of approximately $86.3 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to acquire the call options. Core Laboratories N.V. also entered into separate warrant transactions at the time of the sale of the Notes whereby we sold warrants which give the holders the right to acquire approximately 3.2 million of our common shares at a strike price of $127.56 per share. Upon exercise of the warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or our common shares equal to the difference between the then market price and strike price. All of the warrants will expire on January 25, 2012. We received aggregate proceeds of $56.5 million from the sale of the warrants which was used to repay our outstanding debt. The purchased call options and sold warrants are separate contracts entered into by us with two financial institutions, and are not part of the terms of the notes and will not affect the holders rights under the notes. The purchased call options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon exchange of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common shares at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the purchased call options, which corresponds to the initial exchange price of the Notes and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments. The warrants will effectively increase the exchange price of the notes to $127.56 per share of our common shares, from our perspective, representing a 75% premium based on the last reported bid price of $72.89 per share on October 31, 2006. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00 19, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed To and Potentially Settled In , a Companys Own Stock" and SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," we recorded the exchangeable note hedge and warrants in capital in excess of par value as of the transaction date, and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value. We also recognized a deferred tax asset of $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the effect of the future tax benefits related to the exchangeable note hedge. We maintain a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). In November, 2006, we amended this facility to decrease the aggregate borrowing commitment from $125.0 million to $100.0 million, and added an option to increase the commitment under the credit facility to $150.0 million, if certain conditions are met. The Credit Facility bears interest at variable rates from LIBOR plus 0.5% to a maximum of LIBOR plus 1.125%. The Credit Facility matures in December 2010 and requires interest payments only until maturity. These interest payments are based on the interest period selected. Our available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2006 was $93.1 million. Our available capacity is reduced by outstanding unsecured letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds totaling $6.9 million at December 31, 2006 related to certain projects in progress. The terms of the Credit Facility require us to meet certain financial covenants, including, but not limited to, certain operational and minimum equity and cash flow ratios. We believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreement. All of our material wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under the Credit Facility. In July 1999, we issued $75.0 million in senior notes ("Senior Notes"), which bore interest at an average fixed rate of 8.16%. On December 29, 2005, we repurchased all of our outstanding Senior Notes, in accordance with the Note and Guarantee Agreement, for face value plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium as prescribed in the Senior Note agreement. Such redemption was completed on December 29, 2005 and was funded utilizing a combination of excess cash and borrowings under the Credit Facility. The total cash paid in connection with the repurchase was $76.4 million of which $68.0 million related to the principal amount of the Senior Notes, $2.4 million related to the accrued interest and $6.0 million for a make whole premium which is included in "Debt Prepayment Charge" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to our repayment commitments under our credit facilities and the Notes, we have capital lease obligations related to the purchase of equipment, and non cancelable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land, buildings, office equipment and vehicles. The following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements: Total Less than 1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Contractual Obligations (in thousands): Long term debt 1 $ 302,754 $ 2,754 $ $ 300,000 $ Capital leases 10 8 2 Operating leases 38,010 8,240 11,311 6,328 12,131 Pension and other 2 1,957 1,707 250 Total contractual obligations $ 342,731 $ 12,709 $ 11,563 $ 306,328 $ 12,131 1 We anticipate cash payments for interest of $0.8 million a year for 2007 2011 for a total of $3.8 million 2 Our Dutch pension plan requires annual employer contributions. Amounts payable in the future will be based on future workforce factors which cannot be projected beyond one year. We have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at December 31, 2006. We had tax net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions of approximately $39.4 million at December 31, 2006. If unused, those carry forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2006 through 2025. For 2006, $0.7 million of operating loss carry forwards which carried a full valuation allowance expired unused. Although we cannot assure that these operating loss carry forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2006. We expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately $25.0 million in 2007. In addition, we plan to continue to repurchase our common shares on the open market through our stock repurchase program. Our ability to continue this repurchase program depends on, among other things, market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow. Our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities. We believe our future cash flows from operating activities, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations, capital expenditures, working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions. Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FIN 48"), to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings and other long term liabilities by the end of the first quarter 2007 as provided for in FIN 48. We expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations and our effective income tax rate to vary from period to period as a result of this new guidance. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K and the documents incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10 K by reference contain forward looking statements. These "forward looking statements" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this document, words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "project," "will," "should," "could," "may," "predict" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. You are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements. Any forward looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us or our management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we and Core Lab operate, including, among other things: our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology; the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions; our dependence on one industry, oil and gas, and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our customers; competition in the markets we serve; the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry, political, economic and financial market conditions, including stock prices, government regulations, interest rates and credit availability; unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, currency controls and governmental actions in the numerous countries in which we operate; changes in the price of oil and natural gas; integration of acquired businesses; and the effects of industry consolidation. Our businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors above and similar discussions in our SEC filings. All forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are based on information available to us on the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We do not intend to update or revise any forward looking statements that we may make in this Annual Report on Form 10 K or other documents, reports, filings or press releases, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk We are exposed to market risk, which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We have not entered, or intend to enter, into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes. We do not believe that our exposure to market risks, which are primarily related to interest rate changes, is material. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our Credit Facility debt, which carries a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2006, we had no variable rate debt outstanding. Foreign Currency Risk We operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes. (A foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate.) Foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies and are included in other expense (income) in the statements of operations. We recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. We recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the USD strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated i n the local currency and in countries where the USD weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses are summarized in the following table (in thousands): Year Ended Losses (gains) by currency 2006 2005 2004 British Pound $ (107) $ 269 $ (88) Canadian Dollar (211) (147) (457) Euro (389) 279 96 Russian Ruble (295) 236 (370) Venezuelan Bolivar 17 399 580 Other currencies (458) 583 (549) Total losses (gains) $ (1,443) $ 1,619 $ (788) In February 2004, the Venezuelan government devalued the VEB by 20% to 1,915 VEB per USD. Effective March 2, 2005, the Venezuelan government devalued the VEB by an additional 12% to 2,147 VEB per USD. At December 31, 2006, our net monetary assets denominated in VEB in Venezuela were $3.3 million. We continue to monitor our operations and financial position in this region. Credit Risk Our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms. Our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic, international and national oil and gas companies. Management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies. Table of Contents
