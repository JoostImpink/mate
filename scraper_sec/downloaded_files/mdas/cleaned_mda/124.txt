repayments commenced beginning in the rates for these loans ranged from to the company has generated positive cash flows from operations in each of the last five years during the company generated million cash from operating activities which compares to million for the same period in the prior year the primary reason for this fluctuation was million of increased cash flow from operating results offset by million of decreased cash flow from additional investment in working capital and other operating assets in compared to the major reason for the decrease in cash generated from operating results was the company using million of cash to increase inventory in compared to positive cash flow generated of million from reducing inventory in management currently expects that inventory will grow moderately in in line with demand while at the same time the company works to further improve inventory turns through better processes and lean manufacturing initiatives the company used million and million for investing activities during the years ended december and respectively this spending was primarily for capital expenditures of million in and million in the companys capital investments have been maintained to allow for improvements in operating efficiencies and product quality in the company plans to spend million on capital improvements for continued improvement in operating

through the first quarter of the companys board of directors authorized the resumption of dividends in the third quarter of the companys ability to continue to declare and pay dividends is ultimately dependent upon its ability to operate at profitable levels and demonstrate compliance with its borrowing agreements the effect of changes in foreign currency rates generated cash of million in compared to a decrease in cash of million in as the dollar weakened compared to the euro coupled by a continued weakening against the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent a strengthening against the mexican peso as a result of all of the above items the company experienced a net decrease in cash of million in compared to generating a net increase in cash of million in the company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the companys operations for the foreseeable future off balance sheet arrangements as of december the companys off balance sheet arrangements as that term is described by the securities and exchange commission included million and million of standby letters or credit to support high loss deductible workers compensation insurance programs and the companys commitments with respect to industrial revenue bonds respectively these letters of credit are provided by the companys senior secured lender and are renewable on an annual basis inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the use of the last in first out lifo method of accounting for the majority of inventories results in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued fin no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no accounting for income taxes the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a more likely than not threshold fin no also provides guidance on derecognizing classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no is required to be adopted by the company at the beginning of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin no on its consolidated financial statements but is not yet in a position to make this determination in september the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in the quantification of a misstatement that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material the company adopted sab for its year ending december the adoption of sab did not have an impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in september the fasb issued sfas no fair value measurements sfas no defines fair value establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no on its results of operations and financial position item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an assets or financial instruments value caused for example by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates the companys primary market risk exposures are unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the euro canadian dollar and mexican peso and the interest rate monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates foreign exchange rates and economic developments giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings the companys financial advisors both internal and external provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect managements assessment management does not currently hedge its interest or foreign currency exchange risks foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries and approximately million of the companys revenue from continuing operations was derived from the companys operations outside the united states accordingly exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates no foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates were entered into during and the companys consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than million interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the companys borrowings is influenced by the companys operating performance degree and composition of leverage libor as well as by actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the company in as in in response to improved economic conditions and inflationary tendencies the federal reserve took several actions to increase interest rates this along with similar actions of other central table of contents banks led to a rise in libor this increase was partially offset by the basis point reduction in the interest rates for the companys senior secured loans in the second quarter of based on our operating results as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under its revolving and term secured credit facility increased in this coupled with the companys separate borrowings under the terms of a higher rate subordinated debt in october contributed to a corresponding increase in the companys interest expense to the extent that the federal funds interest rate and libor continue to rise in the future the effective interest rate on companys revolving and term secured facility will increase and the companys interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant based on the balance outstanding under the companys secured credit facility at december a change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by million table of contents

million cash from operating activities which compares to million for the same period in the prior year the primary reason for this fluctuation was million of increased cash flow from operating results offset by million of decreased cash flow from additional investment in working capital and other operating assets in compared to the major reason for the decrease in cash generated from operating results was the company using million of cash to increase inventory in compared to positive cash flow generated of million from reducing inventory in management currently expects that inventory will grow moderately in in line with demand while at the same time the company works to further improve inventory turns through better processes and lean manufacturing initiatives the company used million

compared to a decrease in cash of million in as the dollar weakened compared to the euro coupled by a continued weakening against the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent a strengthening against the mexican peso as a result of all of the above items the company experienced a net decrease in cash of million in compared to generating a net increase in cash of million in the company believes that the combination of cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity is adequate to finance the companys operations for the foreseeable future off balance sheet arrangements as of december the companys off balance sheet arrangements as that term is described by the securities and exchange commission included million and million of standby letters or credit to support high loss deductible workers compensation insurance programs and the companys commitments with respect to industrial revenue bonds respectively these letters of credit are provided by the companys senior secured lender and are renewable on an annual basis inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations the use of the last in first out lifo method of accounting for the majority of inventories results in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues for these long lived assets the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued fin no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no accounting for income taxes the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a more likely than not threshold fin no also provides guidance on derecognizing classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no is required to be adopted by the company at the beginning of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin no on its consolidated financial statements but is not yet in a position to make this determination in september the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in the quantification of a misstatement that when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered is material the company adopted sab for its year ending december the adoption of sab did not have an impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position in september the fasb issued sfas no fair value measurements sfas no defines fair value establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no on its results of operations and financial position item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an assets or financial instruments value caused for example by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates the companys primary market risk exposures are unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the euro canadian dollar and mexican peso and the interest rate monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates foreign exchange rates and economic developments giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings the companys financial advisors both internal and external provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect managements assessment management does not currently hedge its interest or foreign currency exchange risks foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries and approximately million of the companys revenue from continuing operations was derived from the companys operations outside the united states accordingly exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates no foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates were entered into during and the companys consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported net income by less than million interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the companys borrowings is influenced by the companys operating performance degree and composition of leverage libor as well as by actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate that underlies the cost of funds borrowed by the company in as in in response to improved economic conditions and inflationary tendencies the federal reserve took several actions to increase interest rates this along with similar actions of other central table of contents banks led to a rise in libor this increase was partially offset by the basis point reduction in the interest rates for the companys senior secured loans in the second quarter of based on our operating results as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under its revolving and term secured credit facility increased in this coupled with the companys separate borrowings under the terms of a higher rate subordinated debt in october contributed to a corresponding increase in the companys interest expense to the extent that the federal funds interest rate and libor continue to rise in the future the effective interest rate on companys revolving and term secured facility will increase and the companys interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant
