importance or priority we caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict accordingly forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results we undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward looking statements executive level overview we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets we serve more than customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories physician practices and animal health clinics as well as government and other institutions we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our years of experience distributing healthcare products we are headquartered in melville new york employ more than people and have operations in the united states canada the united kingdom the netherlands belgium germany france austria portugal spain the czech republic luxembourg italy ireland switzerland israel australia and new zealand we also have an affiliate in iceland we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency this infrastructure together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices and a strong commitment to customer service enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers needs our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid accurate and complete order fulfillment we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base the healthcare distribution table of contents reportable segment aggregates our dental medical including animal health and international operating segments products distributed include consumable products small equipment laboratory products large dental equipment branded and generic pharmaceuticals vaccines surgical products diagnostic tests infection control products and vitamins our dental group serves office based dental practitioners schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market our medical group serves office based medical practitioners surgical centers other alternate care settings animal health clinics and other institutions throughout the united states our international group serves countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving office based practitioners our technology group provides software technology and other value added services to healthcare practitioners primarily in the united states and canada our value added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners industry overview in recent years the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices it also has accelerated the growth of hmos group practices other managed care accounts and collective buying groups which in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions including software which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business domestically and internationally in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies potential healthcare reform trends toward managed care cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements industry consolidation the healthcare products distribution industry as it relates to office based healthcare practitioners is highly fragmented and diverse this industry which encompasses the dental medical and animal health markets was estimated to produce revenues of approximately billion in in the combined north american and european markets the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices due in part to the inability of office based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent small quantity orders and a need for rapid reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment the purchasing decisions within an office based healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor with one generally serving as the primary supplier we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base table of contents our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with and thus strengthen the acquired businesses as industry consolidation continues we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure in the us dental market we estimate that there are currently more than smaller distributors holding over of the market in the us medical market we estimate that more than smaller distributors hold over of the market and in the european dental market we estimate that more than smaller distributors hold over of the market as the healthcare industry continues to change we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction if pursued if additional transactions are entered into or consummated we would incur merger and acquisition related costs and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population increased healthcare awareness the proliferation of medical technology and testing new pharmacology treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage in addition the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from hospitals to alternate care sites particularly physicians offices as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices the elder care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans the january us bureau of the census estimated that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year in four million americans were aged or older the segment of the population most in need of long term care and elder care services by the year that number is projected to more than triple to more than million the population aged to years is projected to more than double in the same time period as a result of these market dynamics the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published national health care expenditures projections indicating that total national healthcare spending reached trillion in or of the nations gross domestic product the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states healthcare spending is projected to reach trillion in an estimated of the nations gross domestic product government influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation licensure and operating compliance procedures national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress additionally government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care the balanced budget act passed by congress in significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary table of contents prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs generic substitution and provider reimbursement there have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state departments of health state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system certain states have already adopted laws and regulations including pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system regulations adopted under the federal prescription drug marketing act effective december require the passage of pedigree information other states and government agencies are currently considering similar laws and regulations we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation results of operations the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating results and cash flows for each

technology total gross profit increased million or for the year ended december compared to the prior year period as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies additionally we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software

capital needs acquisitions capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock working capital requirements generally result from increased sales special inventory forward buy in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables since sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations revolving credit facilities debt placements and stock issuances our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for and provision by our suppliers of our products and services given current operating economic and industry conditions we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future we do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december compared to million for the comparable prior year period this net change of million was due primarily to timing changes in

purchase commitments include obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from glaxosmithkline biologicals formerly id biomedical corporation novartis ag and the sanofi aventis group through which require us to pay an amount per dose based on the prevailing market price or formula price in each respective year the amounts included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current market conditions in we completed an issuance of million of convertible debt these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of and are due to mature on august interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year which commenced on february the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes which is the equivalent conversion price of per share under the following circumstances if the price of our common stock is above of the conversion price measured over a specified number of trading days during the five business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that trading day period was less than of the average conversion value for the notes during that period if the notes have been called for redemption or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate transactions as defined in the note agreement upon conversion we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted in cash with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our million revolving credit table of contents facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation we also will pay contingent interest during any six month interest period beginning august if the average trading price of the notes is above specified levels we may redeem some or all of the notes on or after august the note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on august and or subject to specified exceptions upon a change of control event our million senior notes are due on june and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum on september we made our first annual principal payment of million on our million senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum principal payments are due annually on september through interest on both notes is payable semi annually in we entered into agreements relating to our million senior notes to exchange their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the value of debt exchanged to a variable rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes as of december there is million of principal remaining with a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december the weighted average variable interest rate was this weighted average variable interest rate is comprised of libor plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for such senior notes on may we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a million expansion feature this facility which expires in may replaced our previous revolving credit facility of million which was scheduled to expire in may as of december there were million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility on june we announced that our board of directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program this program previously allowed us to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock which represented approximately of the shares outstanding on the announcement date on october our board of directors authorized an additional million of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program as of december we had repurchased million or shares under this initiative with million remaining for future common stock share repurchases some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value based on third party valuations or at a price pursuant to a formula as defined in the agreements which approximates fair value additionally some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least months funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which on occasion may change consequently we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements we believe that our cash and cash equivalents our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs e commerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition the advancement of online commerce will require us to cost effectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to table of contents address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis particularly in response to competitive offerings through our proprietary technologically based suite of products we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives we believe that our tradition of reliable service our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical data when available experience industry and market trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources however by their nature estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions judgments and estimates including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied we believe that the following critical accounting policies which have been discussed with our audit committee affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental medical and animal health consumable products as well as equipment software products and services and other sources provisions for discounts rebates to customers customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such sales typically entail high volume low dollar orders shipped using third party common carriers we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post shipment obligations the product price is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians some equipment sales require minimal installation which is completed at the time of delivery revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design revenue derived from post contract customer support for software including annual support and or training is recognized over the period in which the services are provided revenue derived from other sources including freight charges equipment repairs and financial services is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable we consider many factors in estimating our reserve including historical data experience customer types credit table of contents worthiness and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results inventory and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined primarily by the first in first out method in performing our lower of cost or market valuation we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory historical sales forecasted sales and market and economic trends from time to time we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment analyses such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique such as estimates of future cash flows although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental medical including animal health international and technology goodwill was allocated to such reporting units for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses based on a specific identification basis we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable some factors we consider important which could trigger an interim impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business eg decision to divest a business or significant negative industry or economic trends if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income supplier rebates supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results table of contents long lived assets long lived assets including definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements trademarks trade names customer lists customer relationships and intellectual property when an impairment exists the related assets are written down to fair value although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results stock based compensation effective january we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no r share based payment we previously applied accounting principles board opinion no accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of fas accounting for stock based compensation in our consolidated financial statements we elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by fas r and accordingly financial statement amounts for all prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair value method of expensing had been applied from the original effective date of fas such results are consistent with our previously reported pro forma disclosures required under fas we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award awards under our equity incentive plans principally include a combination of at the money stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options stock price volatility risk free interest rates and dividend yields we issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipients continued service over time four year cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving specified performance measurements three year cliff vesting with respect to time based restricted stock we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price with respect to performance based restricted stock the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per share performance measured against specified targets over a three year period we estimate the fair value of performance based restricted stock based on our closing stock price assuming that performance targets will be achieved over the performance period the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the specified targets although we believe our judgments estimates and or assumptions related to stock based compensation are reasonable making material changes to such judgments estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results table of contents recently issued accounting standards in july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas

comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur fas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position the provisions of fas are effective for our year ended december with the exception of the requirement to measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end which is effective for our fiscal year ending december during december we implemented the requirement to recognize the funded status of our retirement benefit plans recognizing the funded status of our defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks which include changes in interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes interest rate swap agreements we have fixed rate senior notes of million at and million at during we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates the variable rates are comprised of libor plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes as a result of these interest rate swap agreements as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million as of december the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other current and non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was million which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to current and non current assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective net investment hedging during the year ended december we implemented a change in our method of assessing the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in spot exchange rates previously we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on changes in forward exchange rates this change in method essentially converts certain us libor based borrowings to euro libor based borrowings allowing us to better align our interest costs and the currency denomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests with regard to all net investment hedging arrangements that existed at the time of this change we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change as a result we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million representing the foreign exchange component of our mark to market adjustment for the period from the date of change through december additionally as a result of this change we recognized a reduction in interest expense of approximately million representing the interest rate component of our mark to market adjustment given current market conditions we expect further reductions of interest expense into the foreseeable future foreign currency agreements the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues gross margins operating expenses and retained earnings all of which are expressed in us dollars where we deem it prudent we engage in hedging programs using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings we purchase short term ie months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of table of contents merchandise purchases to foreign suppliers we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars as we regard this as an accounting exposure not an economic exposure as of december we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of million of which million related to intercompany debt and million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign suppliers the contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the us dollar for euros million british pounds million australian dollars million swiss francs million japanese yen thousand and canadian dollars million in addition our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies the notional amount of such contracts was million a hypothetical change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by million as of december the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements which expire through january recorded in other current liabilities was million as determined by quoted market prices for the year ended december we had realized net gains of million and unrealized gains of million relating to such agreements table of contents
