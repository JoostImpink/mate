item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk elements funding sources the primary source of funding for our lending operations and investments are deposits our deposits are federally insured by the fdic to the maximum extent permitted by law approximately of our deposits are term deposits that pay fixed rates of interest for periods ranging from days to five years of our deposits are adjustable rate passbook accounts and adjustable rate money market accounts with limited checking features and are customer demand deposit accounts our retail checking account balance was million at december we generally accumulate deposits by relying on renewals of term accounts by existing depositors participating in deposit rate surveys which promote the rates offered by us on our deposit products and periodically advertising in various local market newspapers and other media management believes that our deposits are a reliable funding source and that the cost of funds resulting from our deposit gathering strategy is comparable to those of other banks pursuing a similar strategy however because we compete for deposits primarily on the basis of rates we could experience difficulties in attracting deposits if we could not continue to offer deposit rates at levels above those of other financial institutions management also believes that any efforts to significantly increase the size of our deposit base may require greater marketing efforts and or increases in deposit rates at december we had million of brokered deposits for information concerning overall deposits outstanding during the periods indicated and the rates paid thereon see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income the bank also uses advances from the fhlb of san francisco and borrowings from other unaffiliated financial institutions as funding sources fhlb advances are collateralized by pledges of qualifying cash equivalents investment securities mortgage backed securities and loans at december fhlb advances outstanding totaled million and the remaining available borrowing capacity based on the loans and securities pledged as collateral totaled million net of the million of additional fhlb stock that we would be required to purchase to support the additional borrowings additionally the bank has a million repurchase agreement borrowing from an unaffiliated financial institution that is secured by mortgage backed securities the bank also has uncommitted

regulation as a bank holding company itla capital is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board or frb as a california chartered commercial bank the bank is regulated by the california department of financial institutions the dfi and the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic holding company regulation bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act of and the regulations of the federal reserve board as a bank holding company itla capital is required to file reports with the federal reserve board and provide such additional information as the federal reserve board may require itla capital and its non bank subsidiaries are also subject to examination by the federal reserve board the federal reserve board has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies including among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries including its bank subsidiaries in general enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulation as well as unsafe or unsound practices under federal reserve board policy a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks under this policy the federal reserve board may require and has required in the past bank holding companies to contribute additional capital to undercapitalized subsidiary banks under the bank holding company act of a bank holding company must obtain federal reserve board approval before among other matters acquiring directly or indirectly ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if after the acquisition it would own or control more than of these shares unless it already owns or controls a majority of these shares acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company this statute also prohibits a bank holding company with certain exceptions from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking managing or controlling banks or providing services for its subsidiaries the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities which have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks companies that qualify as financial holding companies may also engage in securities insurance and merchant banking activities dividends the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies which expresses the federal reserve boards view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition furthermore under its source of strength doctrine the federal reserve board expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength for its bank subsidiaries which could limit the ability of a holding company to pay dividends if a bank subsidiary did not have sufficient capital repurchase or redemption of equity securities a bank holding company is required to give the federal reserve board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months is equal to or more of its consolidated net worth the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law regulation federal reserve board order or any condition imposed by or written agreement with the federal reserve board this notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well capitalized standard for bank holding companies has a safety and soundness examination rating of at least a and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues table of contents regulatory capital requirements the federal reserve has established risk based measures and a leverage measure of capital adequacy for bank holding companies the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets assets and off balance sheet items such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments are assigned to broad risk categories each with appropriate risk weights the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is total capital consists of two components tier capital and tier capital tier capital generally consists of common shareholders equity including retained earnings noncumulative perpetual preferred stock certain trust preferred securities and minority interest in equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill and other specified intangible assets tier capital must equal at least of risk weighted assets tier capital generally consists of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital instruments other preferred stock a limited amount of loan loss reserves and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities the total amount of tier capital is limited to of tier capital at december our ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets was and our ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was in addition the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets less goodwill and other specified intangible assets of for certain bank holding companies that meet specified criteria including having the highest regulatory rating and implementing the federal reserves risk based capital measure for market risk all other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least at december itla capitals required leverage ratio was and its actual leverage ratio was itla capital currently is deemed well capitalized under the federal reserve board capital requirements to be well capitalized a bank holding company must have a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies including issuance of a capital directive the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits and other restrictions on its business as described below significant additional restrictions can be imposed on fdic insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements bank regulation california law the regulations of the dfi govern most aspects of the banks businesses and operations including but not limited to the scope of its business investments the nature and amount of any collateral for loans the issuance of securities the payment of dividends bank expansion and bank activities the dfis supervision of the bank includes comprehensive reviews of all aspects of the banks business and condition and the dfi possesses broad remedial enforcement authority to influence the banks operations both formally and informally bank regulation federal law the fdic in addition to the dfi broadly regulates the bank as an insurer of deposits the fdic issues regulations conducts examinations requires the filing of reports and generally supervises the operations of institutions to which it provides deposit insurance the fdic is also the federal agency charged with regulating state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system such as the bank insured depository institutions and their institution affiliated parties may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the fdic and the dfi for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law rule regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency management is not aware of any pending or threatened enforcement actions against the bank table of contents regulatory capital requirements federally insured state chartered banks such as the bank are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital as specified in the fdics capital maintenance regulations the fdic also is authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual banks on a case by case basis the bank is required to comply with three separate minimum capital requirements a tier capital ratio and two risk based capital requirements tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and any related surplus and minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries less intangible assets other than properly valued purchased mortgage servicing rights up to certain specified limits and less net deferred tax assets in excess of certain specified limits tier capital ratio fdic regulations establish a minimum ratio of tier capital to total average assets for the most highly rated state chartered fdic supervised banks all other fdic supervised banks must maintain at least a tier capital ratio at december the banks required minimum tier capital ratio was and its actual tier capital ratio was risk based capital requirements the risk based capital requirements generally require the bank to maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of at least to calculate the amount of capital required assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight or based on the relative risk of the category for example united states treasury bills and ginnie mae securities are placed in the risk category fannie mae and freddie mac securities are placed in the risk category loans secured by one to four family residential properties and certain privately issued mortgage backed securities are generally placed in the risk category and commercial and consumer loans and other assets are generally placed in the risk category in addition certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories for purposes of the risk based capital requirements total capital means tier capital plus supplementary or tier capital so long as the amount of supplementary or tier capital that is used to satisfy the requirement does not exceed the amount of tier capital tier capital includes cumulative and certain other perpetual preferred stock mandatory convertible subordinated debt and perpetual subordinated debt mandatory redeemable preferred stock intermediate term preferred stock mandatory convertible subordinated debt and subordinated debt the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on securities at december the banks required minimum tier risk based and total capital ratios were and respectively and its actual was and respectively the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations specifying that the agencies will include in their evaluation of a banks capital adequacy an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the banks capital due to changes in interest rates the fdic and the other federal banking agencies have also promulgated final amendments to their respective risk based capital requirements which identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities and the management of such risk as important factors to consider in assessing an institutions overall capital adequacy the fdic may require higher minimum capital ratios based on certain circumstances including where the institution has significant risks from concentration of credit or certain risks arising from nontraditional activities prompt corrective action requirements the fdic has implemented a system requiring regulatory sanctions against state chartered banks that are not adequately capitalized with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institutions capital the fdic has established specific capital ratios for five separate capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized an institution is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or more its tier risk based ratio is or more its tier capital ratio is or greater and it is not subject to any order or directive by the fdic to meet a specific capital level the bank exceeded these requirements at december the fdic is authorized and under certain circumstances required to take certain actions against institutions that are not at least adequately capitalized any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the fdic may not increase its assets acquire another institution establish a branch or engage in any new activities and generally may not make capital distributions the capital restoration plan must include a limited guaranty by the institutions holding company in addition the fdic must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution with certain limited exceptions within days after it becomes critically undercapitalized table of contents the fdic is also generally authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition community reinvestment act and fair lending requirements federal banking agencies are required to evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods in its most recent examination the fdic rated the bank satisfactory in complying with its community reinvestment act obligations the bank is also subject to certain fair lending nondiscrimination requirements in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws the federal banking agencies take compliance with such laws into account when regulating and supervising other activities such as mergers and acquisitions fiscal and monetary policies our business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies we are particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions deposits and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits the policies of the federal reserve board may have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition federal reserve board regulations require the bank to maintain non interest earning reserves against the banks transaction deposit accounts currently the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from the reserve requirement a reserve requirement applies to balances over million up to million and a reserve requirement applies to balances over million the bank was in compliance with these requirements as of december privacy provisions banking regulators as required under the gramm leach bliley act glb act have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties the rules generally require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties the privacy provisions of the glb act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors the state of california has adopted the california financial information privacy act cfpa which took effect in the cfpa requires a financial institution to provide specific information to a consumer related to the sharing of that consumers nonpublic personal information a consumer may direct the financial institution not to share his or her nonpublic personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated companies with which a financial institution has contracted to provide financial products and services and requires that permission from the consumer be obtained by a financial institution prior to sharing such information these provisions are more restrictive than the privacy provisions of the glb act in december the us congress adopted and president bush signed the fair and accurate transactions act the fact act in federal courts determined that the provisions of the cfpa limiting shared information with affiliates are preempted by provisions of the glb act the fact act and the fair credit reporting act international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of president bush signed the usa patriot act of into law in october this act contains the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the imlafa the imlafa substantially broadened existing anti money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations creates new crimes and penalties compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers the us treasury department has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as the bank the regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the increased obligations of financial institutions including us to identify their customers watch for and report suspicious transactions respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies and share information with other financial institutions requires the implementation and maintenance of internal procedures practices and controls which have increased and may continue to increase our costs and may subject us to liability enforcement and compliance related activity by government agencies has increased money laundering and anti terrorism compliance are among the areas receiving a high level of focus in the present environment table of contents future legislation various legislation including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system is from time to time introduced in congress this legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted this legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our business results of operations or financial condition employees as of december we had employees management believes that its relations with employees are satisfactory we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements segment reporting financial and other information regarding our operating segments is contained in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report internet website we maintain a website with the address wwwitlacapitalcom the information contained on our website is not included as a part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k other than an investors own internet access charges we make available free of charge through our website our annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such material with or furnished such material to the securities and exchange commission item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks and you could lose all or part of your investment fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability and affect the value of our assets like other financial institutions we are subject to interest rate risk our primary source of income is net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings we expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities and the relationships of various interest rates to each other over any defined period of time our interest earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest bearing liabilities or vice versa in addition the individual market interest rates underlying our loan and deposit products may not change to the same degree over a given time period in any event if market interest rates should move contrary to our position our earnings may be negatively affected in addition loan volume and quality and deposit volume and mix can be affected by market interest rates changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread asset quality origination volume and overall profitability interest rates have recently been at historically low levels however since june the us federal reserve has increased its target for the federal funds rate seventeen times from to while these short term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our deposits have increased longer term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our longer term loans have not this flattening of the market yield curve has had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin to date if short term interest rates continue to rise and if rates on our deposits and borrowings continue to reprice upwards faster than the rates on our long term loans and investments we would experience further compression of our interest rate spread and net interest margin which would have a negative effect on our profitability we principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities in a changing interest rate environment we may not be able to manage this risk effectively if we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets all of which ultimately affect our earnings table of contents an increase in loan prepayments may adversely affect our profitability prepayment rates are affected by consumer behavior conditions in the real estate and other financial markets general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on our fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict we recognize our deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans by adjusting our interest income over the contractual life of the individual loans as prepayments occur the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed accelerates the effect of the acceleration of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment penalties paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time which varies between loans if prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated we may not be able to reinvest prepayments on loans or mortgage backed securities at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in periods of declining interest rates an inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce our earnings we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results volatility and deterioration in the economy may also increase our risk for credit losses we evaluate the collectibility of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans general portfolio trends relative to asset and portfolio size potential credit and geographic concentrations delinquency trends and nonaccrual levels historical loss and recovery experience and risks associated with changes in economic social and business conditions the amount and quality of the collateral the views of our regulators and the underwriting standards in effect when the loan is made if our evaluation is incorrect and borrower defaults cause losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses our earnings could be materially and adversely affected we cannot assure you that our allowance will be adequate to cover loan losses inherent in our portfolio we may experience losses in our loan portfolio or perceive adverse trends that require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses in the future which would also reduce our earnings in addition the banks regulators as an integral part of their examination process may require us to make additional provisions for loan losses table of contents our income producing property loans involve higher principal amounts and expose us to a greater risk of loss than one to four family residential loans at december we had billion of loans secured by commercial and multi family real estate representing of our total real estate loans and of our gross loan portfolio the income generated from the operation of the property securing the loan is generally considered by us to be the principal source of repayment on this type of loan a significant portion of the income producing property lending in which we engage typically involves larger loans to a single borrower and is generally viewed as exposing the lender to a greater risk of loss than one four family residential lending because these loans generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period but have a balloon payment due at maturity a borrowers ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property income producing property values are also generally subject to greater volatility than residential property values the liquidation values of income producing properties may be adversely affected by risks generally incident to interests in real property such as changes or continued weakness in general or local economic conditions changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments declines in real estate values declines in rental room or occupancy rates in hotels apartment complexes or commercial properties increases in other operating expenses including energy costs the availability of refinancing at lower interest rates or better loan terms changes in governmental rules regulations and fiscal policies including rent control ordinances environmental legislation and taxation increases in interest rates real estate and personal property tax rates and other factors beyond the control of the borrower or the lender we generally originate and acquire income producing property loans primarily to be held in our portfolio to maturity because the resale market for this type of loan is less liquid than the well established secondary market for residential loans should we decide to sell our income producing property loans we may incur losses on any sale the unseasoned nature of many of the loans we originated as part of our small balance multi family real estate loan platform along with our limited experience in originating loans nationwide may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs which would hurt our profits the national expansion of our real estate loan platform and in particular our small balance multi family real estate loans has led to an increase in the number of these types of loans in our portfolio many of these loans are unseasoned and have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions we have limited experience in originating loans outside the state of california and as a result do not have a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectibility at december billion or of our real estate secured loans were secured by properties located outside the state of california as a result it is difficult to predict the future performance of this portion of our real estate loan portfolio these loans may have delinquency or charge off levels above our historical experience which could adversely affect our profitability our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project these estimates may be inaccurate we originate construction loans for income producing properties as well as for single family home construction at december construction loans totaled million or of gross loans receivable construction lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project which is of uncertain value prior to its completion there are also risks associated with the timely completion of the construction activities for their allotted costs as a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns and the time needed to stabilize income producing properties or to sell residential tract developments because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio as a result construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent in part on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest if our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss table of contents our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities in the course of our business we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage personal injury investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial in addition as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected repayment of our entertainment finance loans is primarily dependent on revenues from distribution contracts through icbef a division of the bank we originate entertainment finance loans to independent producers of film and television on a senior secured basis although these loans are typically collateralized by a mortgage of copyright security agreements and assigned sales contracts the primary source of repayment is the revenue received by the borrower from the licensing of distribution rights for this reason our credit decisions are based in part on the creditworthiness and reputation of the producer sales agent and distributors who have contracted to distribute the films in many instances the distribution contracts provide for multiple payments payable at certain milestones such as execution of contract commencement of principal photography or completion of principal photography the maturity date of the loan is generally six to nine months after completion of the production to the extent a distributor fails to make payment upon completion of the film or the predicted level of revenue is less than expected we may incur a loss if rights cannot be resold for the same amount or other loan collateral cannot cover required loan payments negative events in certain geographic areas particularly california could adversely affect us although we have significantly increased the geographic diversification of our loan portfolio since commencing our national expansion our real estate loans remain heavily concentrated in the state of california with approximately of our real estate loans as of december secured by collateral and made to borrowers in that state in addition as of that date approximately and of our real estate loans were secured by collateral and made to borrowers in the states of arizona and texas respectively we have no other state geographic concentration of loans in excess of three percent of our total gross loan portfolio a worsening of economic conditions in california or in any other state in which we have a significant concentration of borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing demand for new financings limiting the ability of customers to repay existing loans and impairing the value of our real estate collateral and real estate owned properties real estate values are affected by various other factors including changes in general or regional economic conditions governmental rules or policies and natural disasters such as earthquakes tornados and hurricanes our wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as a part of our liquidity management we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments as we continue to grow we are likely to become more dependent on these sources which include brokered certificates of deposit repurchase agreements federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank advances adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates finally if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs in this case our profitability would be adversely affected competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability the banking and financial services industry is very competitive legal and regulatory developments have made it easier for new and sometimes unregulated competitors to compete with us consolidation among financial service providers has resulted in fewer very large national and regional banking and financial institutions holding a large accumulation of assets these institutions generally have significantly greater resources a wider geographic presence or greater accessibility our competitors sometimes are also able to offer more services more favorable pricing or greater customer convenience than we do in addition our competition has grown from new banks and other financial services providers that target our existing or potential customers as consolidation continues among large banks we expect additional institutions to try to exploit our market table of contents technological developments have allowed competitors including some non depository institutions to compete more effectively in local markets and have expanded the range of financial products services and capital available to our target customers if we are unable to implement maintain and use such technologies effectively we may not be able to offer products or achieve cost efficiencies necessary to compete in our industry in addition some of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures we rely heavily on the proper functioning of our technology we rely on our computer systems and outside sources providing technology for much of our business including recording our assets and liabilities if our computer systems or outside technology sources fail are not reliable or there is a breach of security our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired which could materially affect our operations and financial condition we are dependent upon the services of our management team we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key management personnel who have substantial experience with our operations the financial services industry and the markets in which we offer our services it is possible that the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key managers would have an adverse effect on our operations our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract manage and retain other qualified personnel as we grow we cannot assure you that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel terrorist activities could cause reductions in investor confidence and substantial volatility in real estate and securities markets it is impossible to predict the extent to which terrorist activities may occur in the united states or other regions or their effect on a particular security issue it is also uncertain what effects any past or future terrorist activities and or any consequent actions on the part of the united states government and others will have on the united states and world financial markets local regional and national economics and real estate markets across the united states among other things reduced investor confidence could result in substantial volatility in securities markets a decline in general economic conditions and real estate related investments and an increase in loan defaults such unexpected losses and events could materially affect our results of operations we are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business bank holding companies and california charted commercial banks operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and examination by federal and state regulatory agencies we are subject to the bank holding company act of as amended and to regulation and supervision by the frb imperial capital bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the fdic and dfi the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution permissible types amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments permissible non banking activities the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments the fdic and dfi possess cease and desist powers to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation and the frb possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding

item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies followed by us conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base our estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates table of contents we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting polices related to the allowance for loan losses are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management we also consider our accounting polices related to other real estate owned to be critical due to the potential significance of these activities and the estimates involved critical accounting policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below also see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report allowance for loan losses all our management assesses the adequacy of the all prior to the end of each calendar quarter this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance we establish the all amount separately for two different risk groups individual loans loans with specifically identifiable risks and homogeneous loans groups of loan with similar characteristics we base the allocation for individual loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and review processes we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio which is determined based on the experience of management and our independent loan review process we estimate losses on impaired loans based on estimated cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or based on the underlying collateral value based on managements experience we also assign loss ratios to groups of loans these loss ratios are assigned to the various homogenous categories of the portfolio the level of the allowance also reflects managements continuing evaluation of geographic and credit concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our loan portfolio the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications we test the all balance by comparing the balance in the all to historical trends and peer information our management team then evaluates the result of the procedures performed including the result of our testing and concludes on the appropriateness of the balance of the all in its entirety see the section captioned allowance for loan losses and nonperforming assets elsewhere in this discussion for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for loan losses other real estate owned properties acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure are transferred to the other real estate owned portfolio and initially recorded at estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property subsequent to foreclosure valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs of disposition the fair value of other real estate owned is generally determined from appraisals obtained from independent appraisers table of contents adoption and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no revised share based payment which is a revision of sfas no sfas no r supersedes apb opinion no generally the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas no r is similar to the approach described in sfas no however sfas no r requires share based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values ie pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition we adopted sfas no r on january using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application under modified prospective application as it is applicable to us sfas no r applies to new awards and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after january additionally compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that are outstanding as of january must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered over periods after the adoption of sfas no r the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation total stock based compensation expense included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december was approximately net of tax or per diluted share no stock based compensation expense was included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december and unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options was approximately at december at that date the weighted average period over which the unrecognized expense was expected to be recognized was years in february the fasb issued sfas no accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of sfas nos and sfas no permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and amends sfas no to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument this statement is effective for us on january management does not expect the adoption of sfas no to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in march the fasb issued sfas no accounting for servicing of financial assets this statement amends sfas no accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities sfas no requires companies to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract the statement permits a company to choose either the amortized cost method or fair value measurement method for each class of separately recognized servicing assets this statement is effective for us on january management does not expect the adoption of sfas no to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in september the fasb issued sfas no fair value measurements sfas no defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no is effective for us on january management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no on our financial condition and results of operations in june the fasb issued fasb interpretation no accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no fin fin establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition requirements fin is effective for us on january management does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in may the fasb issued sfas no accounting changes and error corrections which is a replacement of apb opinion no accounting changes and sfas no reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas no applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas no requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable apb opinion no previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle the adoption of sfas no on january did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in february the fasb issued sfas no the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value the objective of sfas no is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently sfas no also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas no is effective for us on january management does not expect the adoption of sfas no to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations table of contents general the following discussion and analysis reviews the financial condition and results of our consolidated operations including our significant consolidated subsidiaries imperial capital bank and imperial capital real estate investment trust the following discussion and analysis is intended to identify the major factors that influenced our financial condition as of december and and our results of operations for the years ended december and our primary business involves the acceptance of customer deposits and the origination and purchase of loans secured by income producing real estate and to a lesser extent the origination of entertainment finance loans consolidated net income in was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in the increase in net income in was primarily due to an increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses which increased to million during the year ended december compared to million for the prior year this increase was primarily due to the growth in the average balance of our loan portfolio and adjustable rate loans repricing to higher current market interest rates partially offset by additional interest expense incurred due to the growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities deposits and other interest bearing liabilities repricing to higher current market interest rates and the addition of new borrowings net income was further augmented by a million decrease in the provision for loan losses recorded during compared to the prior year the provision recorded during reflected the impact of

connection with the sale of substantially all of our franchise loan portfolio there were no comparable loan sales in the decrease in net income in as compared to was primarily due to the absence of interest and fee income earned in connection with the banks tax refund lending ral program which terminated at the conclusion of the tax season despite the termination of the ral program net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december this increase was due to the growth in the average balance of our loan portfolio a decrease in the average balance of low yielding short term and overnight investments and an increase in the average balance of higher yielding investment securities held to maturity as compared to the decline in the average balance of short term and overnight investment securities was a result of the termination of the ral program which generated a substantial level of liquidity during the quarter ended march we invested this additional liquidity in short term and overnight investments which earned a lower yield than we generally earn on our investment portfolio the increase in interest income was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred due to the growth in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities as compared to deposits repricing to higher market interest rates and the addition of borrowings at higher market interest rates our earnings were negatively impacted by a million increase in provision for loan losses recorded during

cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear also in the above table the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the residual interest is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments but increased credit losses which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities and depending on the severity of such changes the results of operations

the significant growth in our total loan portfolio during the year which increased by compared to the prior year as well as the continuing decline in our overall risk profile due to a broader

loan losses accounting policy is critical to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations as such selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgments estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and depending upon the severity of such changes the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood management periodically assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reference to many quantitative and qualitative factors that may be weighted differently at various times depending on prevailing conditions these factors include among other elements the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans general portfolio trends relative to asset and portfolio size asset categories potential credit and geographic concentrations delinquency trends and nonaccrual loan levels historical loss experience and risks associated with changes in economic social and business conditions and the underwriting standards in effect when the loan was made accordingly the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is not based solely on the level of nonperforming assets the quantitative factors included above are utilized by our management to identify two different risk groups individual loans loans with specifically identifiable risks and homogeneous loans groups of loan with similar characteristics we base the allocation for individual loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and review processes we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio which is determined based on the experience of management and our independent loan review process we estimate losses on impaired loans based on estimated cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or based on the underlying collateral value based on managements experience we also assign loss ratios to groups of loans these loss ratios are assigned to the various homogenous categories of the portfolio the qualitative factors included above are generally utilized to identify other risks inherent in the portfolio and to determine whether the estimated credit losses associated with the current portfolio might differ from historical loss trends we estimate a range of exposure for each qualitative factor and evaluate the current condition and trend of each factor based on this evaluation we assign a positive negative or neutral grade to each factor to determine whether the portion of the qualitative reserve is in the high middle or low end of the range for each factor because of the subjective nature of these factors and the judgments required to determine the estimated ranges the actual losses incurred can vary significantly from the estimated amounts management believes that our allowance for loan losses as of december was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date while management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination table of contents the following table sets forth the delinquency status of our loan portfolios at each of the dates indicated december amount percent of gross portfolio amount percent of gross portfolio amount percent of gross portfolio dollars in thousands period of delinquency days days days or more total loans delinquent the increase in total delinquent loans in was due primarily to an increase of million of past due real estate loans partially offset by a million decrease in past due entertainment finance loans and a million decrease in past due franchise loans we have established a policy that all loans greater than million are reviewed annually this review usually involves obtaining updated information about the collateral and source of repayment in addition independent outside consultants periodically review our loan portfolio and report findings to management and the audit committee of the board of directors loans considered to warrant special attention are presented to the review and reserve committee which meets at least monthly to review the status of classified loans consider new classifications or declassifications determine the need for and amount of any charge offs and recommend to our executive committee of the board of directors the level of allowance for loan losses to be maintained if management believes that the collection of the full amount of principal is unlikely and the value of the collateral securing the obligation is insufficient the difference between the loan balance and the fair market value of the collateral are recognized by a partial charge off of the loan balance to the collaterals fair value while real property collateral is held for sale it is subject to periodic evaluation and or appraisal if an evaluation or appraisal indicates that the property will ultimately sell for less than our recorded value plus costs of disposition the loss is recognized by a charge to allowance for other real estate owned losses loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become days or more contractually delinquent or earlier if the collection of interest is considered by management to be doubtful unless the loan is considered well secured and in the process of collection subsequent cash collections on nonaccrual loans are either recognized as interest income on a cash basis if the loan is well secured and in managements judgment the net book value is fully collectible or recorded entirely as a reduction of principal the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets by category and troubled debt restructurings as of the dates indicated december dollars in thousands

real estate owned was sold resulting in million of other real estate owned at december as of december and we had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million and million respectively with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the non accrual loan category item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans investments and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings loan volumes and yields as well as the volume of and rates on investments deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates additionally because of the terms and conditions of many of our loan agreements and deposit accounts a change in interest rates could also affect the duration of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base which could alter our sensitivity to future changes in interest rates interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration among other factors our overall credit operating income operating cost and capital profile the assetliability management committee which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change in net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates see item business nonperforming assets and other loans of concern in evaluating our exposure to changes in interest rates certain risks inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following tables must be considered for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees and at different times to changes in market rates additionally loan prepayments and early withdrawals of time certificates could cause interest sensitivities to vary from those that appear in the following table further certain assets such as adjustable rate real estate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset the majority of our adjustable rate real estate loans may not adjust downward below their initial rate with increases generally limited to maximum adjustments of per year and up to over the life of the loan these loans may also be subject to prepayment penalties at december of our adjustable rate loan portfolio could not adjust downward below the floor rate and the weighted average minimum interest rate for these loans was at december of the total loans outstanding had a lifetime interest rate cap with a weighted average lifetime interest rate cap of the anticipated effects of these various factors are considered by management in implementing interest rate risk management activities we use an internal earnings simulation model as a tool to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile the model is based on projected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments considering applicable interest rate floors and caps and prepayment penalties associated with each financial instrument these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies table of contents the following table shows our estimated earnings sensitivity profile to immediate parallel shifts in interest rates as of december changes in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months + over one year + over one year over one year over one year another tool used to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile is the static gap analysis interest sensitivity gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods the following table presents an estimate of our static gap analysis as of december maturing or repricing in months or less after months but within year after year but within years after years non interest sensitive total dollars in thousands assets loans cash and cash equivalents investment securities available for sale investment securities held to maturity non interest earning assets less allowance for loan losses total assets liabilities and shareholders equity time certificates under time certificates and more money market and passbook accounts demand deposit accounts fhlb advances and other borrowings other liabilities junior subordinated debentures shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net repricing assets over under repricing liabilities equals interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets approximately of our loan portfolio was comprised of adjustable rate loans at december and approximately of the loan portfolio was comprised of hybrid loans which become adjustable rate loans after an initial fixed rate period of three or five years our adjustable rate loans generally re price on a quarterly or semi annual basis with increases generally limited to maximum adjustments of per year up to for the life of the loan nonaccrual loans of approximately million are assumed to reprice after five years certain shortcomings are inherent in a gap analysis for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates also the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates additionally certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset further in the event of a change in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table finally the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe interest rate increase table of contents
