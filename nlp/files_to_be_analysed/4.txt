item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview avx corporation is a leading worldwide manufacturer and supplier and reseller of a broad line of passive electronic components and interconnect products electronic components and connector products manufactured or resold by avx are used in virtually all types of electronic products including those in telecommunications automotive transportation energy harvesting consumer electronics militaryaerospace medical computer and industrial markets we have five main product groups ceramic components tantalum components advanced components interconnect products and kyocera electronic devices these product lines are organized into three reportable segments passive components interconnect and ked resale consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended march were million with net income of million compared to consolidated revenues of million with net income of million for the fiscal year ended march during fiscal we saw a decrease in sales due to a number of factors including lower unit sales due to soft global economic conditions and our customers inventory reduction initiatives the effect of the strength of the us dollar versus the japanese yen and euro on reported sales and the transfer of kyocera manufactured connector product resale activity in the asian region previously handled by avx to kyocera effective april gross profit margins declined slightly year over year to from and operating results were unfavorably impacted by certain environmental and legal charges discussed below in fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities we used cash generated from operations to fund million of general working capital requirements and million of property and equipment purchases in addition to enhance shareholder value we spent million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the market and paid dividends of million during fiscal year our financial position remains strong with approximately billion of cash cash equivalents and securities investments and no borrowings as of march we remain committed to investing in new products and improvements to our production processes as well as continued investment in research development and engineering in order to provide our customers with new generations of passive component and interconnect product solutions we are currently producing more sophisticated electronic component parts necessitated by the breadth and increase in functionality of the electronic devices and increased electronic content in products such as smart phones wearable electronic devices tablets ultrabooks netbooks automobiles and renewable energy products that are manufactured by our customers as a result we have continued our focus on value added advanced products and interconnect solutions to serve this expanding market we are also focused on controlling and reducing costs to accommodate market forces and offset rising operating costs we do this by investing in automated manufacturing technologies enhancing manufacturing materials and efficiencies and rationalizing our production capabilities around the world we believe that these strategies enable us to adapt quickly and benefit as market conditions change in order to provide shareholder value in addition we may from time to time consider strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses in order to expand our product offerings or otherwise improve our market position we evaluate potential acquisitions in order to position ourselves to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities outlook near term with continuing uncertain global geopolitical and economic conditions it is difficult to quantify expectations for fiscal near term results for us will depend on the impact of the overall global geopolitical and economic conditions and their impact on telecommunications information technology hardware automotive consumer electronics and other electronic markets looking ahead visibility is limited and forecasting is a challenge due to volatility and uncertainty in global government and consumer spending we expect to see typical pricing pressure in the markets we serve due to competitive activity in response to anticipated market conditions we expect to continue to focus on the sale of higher margin value added electronic components to support todays advanced electronic devices and cost management to maximize earnings potential we also continue to focus on process improvements and enhanced production capabilities in conjunction with product line rationalizations if current global geopolitical and economic conditions worsen the overall impact on our customers as well as end user demand for electronic products could have a significant adverse impact on our near term results long term although there is uncertainty and caution in the near term market as a result of the current global geopolitical and economic conditions we continue to see opportunities for long term growth and profitability improvement due to a a projected increase in the long term worldwide demand for more sophisticated electronic devices which require electronic components such as the ones we sell b cost reductions and improvements in our production processes and c opportunities for growth in our advanced component and interconnect product lines due to new products resulting from advances in component designs and our expanded production capabilities we have fostered our financial health and the strength of our balance sheet we remain confident that our strategies will enable our continued long term success results of operations year ended march compared to year ended march net sales for the fiscal year ended march were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march the table below represents product group revenues for the fiscal years ended march and fiscal year ended march sales revenue in thousands ceramic components tantalum components advanced components total passive components kdp and kcd resale kcp resale connectors total ked resale interconnect total revenue passive component sales were million for the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march the sales decrease in passive components reflects a lower overall market demand across most of our product market segments related to soft global economic conditions the unfavorable impact on reported sales of currency exchange as the us dollar strengthened against certain foreign currencies and our continued focus on the sale of value added and higher capacitance components with higher margin opportunities and lower sales volumes rather than higher volume commodity components when compared to the same period last year lower sales is also reflective of our customers cautious inventory management programs during the current fiscal year kdp and kcd resale sales were million for the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march this increase is primarily attributable to higher demand from our telecommunications and cellular device customers in the current year partially offset by the unfavorable impact on reported sales of the stronger us dollar when compared to the japanese yen total connector sales including avx interconnect products and kcp resale connectors were million in the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march this decrease was primarily attributable to kyoceras decision to utilize their sales force rather than continuing to have avx resell their connector products in asia kyocera notified avx in february of its intent effective april to market its connector products in asia using kyoceras sales force rather than continuing to have avx resell such products in asia sales of kyocera manufactured connector products in asia were million and million with operating profit of million and million for the fiscal years ended march and march respectively for more information regarding avxs relationship with kyocera see relationship with kyocera and related transactions below in addition there was a negative impact on reported sales resulting from the strength of the us dollar when compared to the japanese yen and the euro partially offset by improved volumes to our automotive customers our sales to independent electronic distributors represented of total net sales for the fiscal year ended march compared to for fiscal year ended march overall distributor activity as a percentage of sales decreased slightly when compared to the same period in the prior year reflective of their cautious inventory management programs our sales to distributor customers may involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales such allowance charges decreased to million or of gross sales to distributor customers for the fiscal year ended march compared to million or of gross sales to distributor customers for the fiscal year ended march applications under such programs for fiscal years ended march and were approximately million and million respectively geographically compared to the prior fiscal year regional sales as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal year ended march increased slightly in the americas while decreasing slightly in europe generally all three geographic regions faced similar market conditions our asian market sales were impacted kyoceras aforementioned decision to utilize their sales force rather than continuing to have avx resell kyocera manufactured connector products in this region sales in asia remained of total sales while sales in the americas increased slightly to and sales in europe decreased slightly to of total sales this compares to and of total sales for the asian american and european regions in the prior year respectively as a result of the strength of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies reported sales for the year ended march were unfavorably impacted by approximately million when compared to the prior year gross profit margin in the fiscal year ended march decreased slightly to of sales or million compared to a gross profit margin of of sales or million in the fiscal year ended march this overall decrease in dollars and percentage is primarily a result of lower sales volumes and lower selling prices reflective of soft demand in the global marketplace when compared to the same period last year the impact on gross margin due to lower selling prices was partially offset by our focus on the sale of value added and higher capacitance passive components with better margin opportunities than higher volume commodity components gross profit also benefited from lower manufacturing and overhead costs due to our focus on cost control and manufacturing efficiencies in addition the currency impact of a stronger us dollar against certain foreign currencies favorably impacted costs by approximately million when compared to the same period last year selling general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for the fiscal year ended march the overall increase in selling general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher legal advisory fees partially offset by lower selling expenses as a result of lower sales for the fiscal year ended march compared to the fiscal year ended march during the fiscal ended march we recorded estimated litigation and settlement charges of million related to the outcome of certain litigation and remediation challenges involving legacy environmental issues and intellectual property litigation effective september a settlement agreement and mutual release settlement agreement was entered into with the city of new bedford in settlement of the following two cases darosa v city of new bedford and city of new bedford et al v avx corporation both arising from contamination at certain property sites in the city of new bedford in accordance with the settlement agreement avx paid the sum of million to the city of new bedford in october additionally on january in a patent infringement case filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware captioned greatbatch inc v avx corporation the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and found damages to the plaintiff in the amount of million also during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march we accrued a million estimated charge related to a new environmental remediation demand related to a legacy environmental issue and a million charge related to a recent jury finding with respect to an intellectual property lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware captioned presidio components inc v american technical ceramics corp profit from operations for the fiscal year ended march decreased million to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march this decrease is a result of the factors above other income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income resulting from an increase in the overall average balance of our cash and investments during fiscal when compared to fiscal and foreign currency exchange gains the tax rate for the fiscal year ended march was a tax rate of compared to a tax benefit of for the fiscal year ended march for fiscal the rate of is impacted by a reduction of income tax reserves related to the expiration of statutory periods with regard to certain income tax positions of approximately million excluding such discrete items recorded during the fiscal year ended march the effective tax rate would have been the tax rate for fiscal was impacted by net income tax benefits of million primarily attributable to the reversal of valuation allowances of million related to the forecasted future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards nols in our european operations and net tax benefits of million primarily due to the us tax benefits related to the restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries excluding such discrete items recorded during the fiscal year ended march the effective tax rate would have been the gross nols related to the million reversal of valuation allowances in the fiscal year ended march were million the related tax benefits upon utilization of the nols are un expiring however they are subject to annual utilization limitations the realization of tax benefits due to the utilization of these nols could take an extended period of time to realize and are contingent upon the foreign subsidiarys continuing profitability as a result of the factors discussed above net income for the fiscal year ended march was million compared to a million for the fiscal year ended march year ended march compared to year ended march net sales for the fiscal year ended march were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march the table below represents product group revenues for the fiscal years ended march and fiscal year ended march sales revenue in thousands ceramic components tantalum components advanced components total passive components kdp and kcd resale kcp resale connectors total ked resale interconnect total revenue passive component sales were million for the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march the sales decrease in passive components specifically tantalum components reflects overall market demand and our continued focus on the sale of value added and higher capacitance components with better margin opportunities lower sales is also reflective of our customers management of inventory levels in the fiscal year ended march and the negative effects of currency exchange as the us dollar strengthened against certain foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen and the euro the increase in sales of ceramic and advanced components reflects the demand in the automotive computer industrial and telecommunications equipment markets for more sophisticated electronic components across global markets kdp and kcd resale sales were million for the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march this decrease is primarily attributable to lower demand from and inventory management by our cellular device customers as well as the unfavorable impact due to the strength of the us dollar when compared to the japanese yen total connector sales including avx interconnect products and kcp resale connectors were million in the fiscal year ended march compared to million during the fiscal year ended march this increase was primarily attributable to an increased demand in the automotive sector reflective of the increased electronic content in todays automobiles partially offset by the negative impact on sales resulting from the strength of the us dollar when compared to the japanese yen and the euro kyocera notified avx in february of its intent effective april to market its manufactured connector products in asia using kyoceras sales force rather than continuing to have avx resell such products in asia sales of kyocera connector products in asia were million and million with operating profit of million and million for the fiscal years ended march and march respectively our sales to independent electronic distributors represented of total net sales for the fiscal year ended march compared to for fiscal year ended march overall distributor activity increased when compared to the same period in the prior year reflective of their end customer demand improvements our sales to distributor customers may involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales such allowance charges decreased to million or of gross sales to distributor customers for the fiscal year ended march compared to million or of gross sales to distributor customers for the fiscal year ended march reflecting stable selling price conditions primarily in the americas due to balanced supply applications under such programs for fiscal years ended march and were approximately million and million respectively geographically compared to the prior fiscal year ended march sales increased in the americas and europe while asia saw a decrease the asian market sales continued to reflect the lower ked resale product sales in the telecommunications markets and the negative effect on sales primarily due to the strength of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen sales in asia represented of total sales while sales in the americas increased to and sales in europe increased to of total sales respectively this compares to and of total sales for the asian american and european regions in the prior year respectively as a result of the strength of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies sales for the year ended march were unfavorably impacted by approximately million when compared to the prior year gross profit margin in the fiscal year ended march increased to of sales or million compared to a gross profit margin of of sales or million in the fiscal year ended march this overall increase is primarily attributable to our focus on the sale of value added and higher capacitance passive component sales with better margin opportunities and lower manufacturing and overhead costs due to our focus on cost control and manufacturing efficiencies when compared to the prior fiscal year costs were favorably impacted by approximately million due to the strength of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies selling general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for the fiscal year ended march the overall decrease in selling general and administrative expenses reflects the impact of lower sales volumes and lower depreciation expense offset by higher professional fees for the fiscal year ended march compared to the fiscal year ended march profit from operations for the fiscal year ended march increased million to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march this increase is a result of the factors above other income increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income resulting from an increase in the overall average balance of our cash and investments during fiscal when compared to fiscal the tax rate for the fiscal year ended march was a tax benefit of compared to a tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march the lower rate for fiscal is the result of net income tax benefits of million primarily attributable to the reversal of valuation allowances of million related to the forecasted future utilization of nols in our european operations and net tax benefits of million primarily due to the us tax benefits related to the restructuring of foreign subsidiaries excluding such discrete items recorded during the fiscal year ended march the effective tax rate would have been for fiscal the rate of is primarily due to reserve adjustments due to the expiration of tax periods allowed for the audit of certain prior year income tax returns and adjustments of approximately million related to prior period income tax accruals and estimates excluding such discrete items recorded during the fiscal year ended march the effective tax rate would have been the gross nols related to the million reversal of valuation allowances in the fiscal year ended march are million the related tax benefits upon utilization of the nols are un expiring however they are subject to annual utilization limitations the realization of tax benefits due to the utilization of these nols could take an extended period of time to realize and are contingent upon the foreign subsidiarys continuing profitability as a result of the factors discussed above net income for the fiscal year ended march was million compared to a million for the fiscal year ended march financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements dividends capital expenditures and acquisitions historically we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through funds from operations investment income from cash and investments in securities and cash on hand as of march we had a current ratio of to billion of cash cash equivalents and investments in securities million of stockholders equity and no borrowings as of march we had cash cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in securities of billion of which million was held outside the us liquidity is subject to many factors such as normal business operations as well as general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors that are beyond our control cash balances generated and held in foreign locations are used for their on going working capital capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions these balances are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the us if these funds were needed for general corporate purposes in the us we would incur significant income taxes to repatriate to the us cash held in foreign locations in addition local government regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances management does not believe such restrictions would limit our ability to pursue our intended business strategies net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended march compared to cash provided by operations of million for the fiscal year ended march and cash used in operations of million for the fiscal year ended march cash provided by operations was lower in fiscal compared to the same period last year primarily a result a final payment of million made on may related to the new bedford harbor environmental matters discussed below and other changes in working capital fiscal included two installment payments with respect to the settlement approved by the united states district court on september with the epa and the commonwealth of massachusetts related to the harbor october we paid the initial settlement installment of million plus accrued interest we prepaid a second settlement installment of million plus accrued interest on the remaining settlement amount on march as noted above we prepaid the remaining balance of million plus interest of million on may purchases of property and equipment totaled million in fiscal million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in expenditures during fiscal were primarily made in connection with strategic building expansion and equipment purchase activities in the czech republic mexico and greenville south carolina as we expanded production capabilities of the passive component and interconnect product lines we expect to continue to make strategic capital investments in our passive component and interconnect product lines and estimate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end market demand historically our funding has been internally generated through operations investment income from cash cash equivalents and investments in securities and cash on hand we have assessed the condition of our financial resources and our current business and believe that based on our financial condition as of march cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and investment income from cash cash equivalents and investments in securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital capital expenditures environmental clean up costs pension plan funding research development and engineering expenses and dividend payments or stock repurchases to be made during the upcoming year while changes in customer demand have an impact on our future cash requirements changes in those requirements are mitigated by our ability to adjust manufacturing capabilities to meet increases or decreases in customer demand also potential acquisitions depending upon their size could require the company to utilize its current cash resources or use external borrowings we do not anticipate any significant changes in our ability to generate cash flows or meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future in fiscal and dividends of million million and million respectively were paid to stockholders on october the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of an additional shares of our common stock we purchased shares at a cost of million during fiscal shares at a cost of million during fiscal and shares at a cost of million during fiscal the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes as of march there were shares that may yet be repurchased under this program at march we had contractual obligations for the construction of plants and acquisition of equipment aggregating approximately million we make contributions to our us and international defined benefit plans as required under various pension funding regulations contributions are based on a percentage of pensionable wages or requirements necessary to satisfy long term funding obligations we made contributions of million to our us defined benefit plans during the fiscal year ended march and do not estimate that any contributions will be made during the fiscal year ending march we made contributions of million to our international defined benefit plans during the fiscal year ended march and estimate that we will make contributions of approximately million during the fiscal year ending march we have unfunded actuarially computed pension liabilities of approximately million related to these defined benefit pension plans as of march we are a lessee under longterm operating leases primarily for office space plant and equipment future minimum lease commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of march were approximately million from time to time we enter into delivery contracts with selected suppliers for certain metals used in our production processes the delivery contracts represent routine purchase orders for delivery within three months and payment is due upon receipt we have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa state governmental agencies or other private parties as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or equivalent state or local laws for clean up and response costs associated with certain sites at which remediation is required with respect to prior contamination because cercla or such state statutes authorize joint and several liability the epa or state regulatory authorities could seek to recover all clean up costs from any one of the prps at a site despite the involvement of other prps at certain sites financially responsible prps other than avx also are or have been involved in site investigation and clean up activities we believe that liability resulting from these sites will be apportioned between avx and other prps to resolve our liability at the sites at which we have been named a prp we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees with federal and state regulatory agencies governing the timing and nature of investigation and remediation as is customary the orders and decrees regarding sites where the prps are not themselves implementing the chosen remedy contain provisions allowing the epa to reopen the agreement and seek additional amounts from settling prps in the event that certain contingencies occur such as the discovery of significant new information about site conditions on october the epa the united states and the commonwealth of massachusetts and avx announced that they had reached a financial settlement with respect to the epas ongoing clean up of the new bedford harbor in the commonwealth of massachusetts the harbor that agreement is contained in a supplemental consent decree that modifies certain provisions of prior agreements related to clean up of the harbor including elimination of the governments right to invoke certain reopener provisions in the future under the terms of the settlement avx was obligated to pay million plus interest computed from august in three installments over a two year period for use by the epa and the commonwealth to complete the clean up of the harbor on may we prepaid the third and final settlement installment of million plus interest of million on june avx entered into an agreement with the epa and the city of new bedford pursuant to which avx is required to perform environmental remediation at a site referred to as the aerovox site the site located in new bedford massachusetts avx has substantially completed its obligations pursuant to such agreement with the epa and the city of new bedford with respect to the satisfaction of avxs federal law requirements agreements with the state regulatory authorities have yet to be concluded but are likely to include additional groundwater and soil remediation we have a remaining accrual of million at march representing our estimate of the potential liability related to the remaining performance of environmental remediation actions at the site using certain assumptions regarding the plan of remediation since additional sampling and analysis may cause the state regulatory authority the massachusetts department of environmental protection to require a more extensive and costly plan of remediation until all parties agree and remediation is complete we cannot be certain there will be no additional cost relating to the site we had total reserves of approximately million and million at march and march respectively related to the various matters and specific sites discussed above these reserves are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as million and million in accrued expenses at march and march respectively and million and million in other non current liabilities at march and march respectively the amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are based on estimates amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional legal and technical information that becomes available also uncertainties about the status of laws regulations regulatory actions technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure accordingly these costs could differ from our current estimates effective september a settlement agreement and mutual release settlement agreement was entered into with the city of new bedford in settlement of the following two cases darosa v city of new bedford and city of new bedford et al v avx corporation both arising from contamination at certain property sites in the city of new bedford in accordance with the settlement agreement avx paid the sum of million to the city of new bedford in october this settlement agreement releases avx from any future actions by the city of new bedford related to these cases or sites on april the canadian ministry of the environment and climate change the moe issued a directors order naming avx corporation as well as others as responsible parties with respect to a location in hamilton ontario that was the site of operations of aerovox canada a former subsidiary of aerovox corporation a predecessor of avx this directors order follows a draft order issued on november avx has taken the position that any liability of aerovox canada for such site under the laws of canada cannot be imposed on avx at present it is unclear whether the moe will seek to enforce such canadian order against avx and whether in the event it does so avx will have any liability under applicable law avx intends to contest any such course of action that may be taken by the moe we also operate on other sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during avxs long history of manufacturing operations or prior to the start of operations by avx even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental matters at certain sites regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated we establish reserves or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs a separate account receivable is recorded for any indemnified costs our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries which are not expected to be significant but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party on april avx was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware captioned greatbatch inc v avx corporation this case alleged that certain avx products infringe on one or more of nine greatbatch patents on january the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the first phase of a segmented trial and found damages to greatbatch in the amount of million avx is reviewing this initial verdict consulting with its legal advisors on what action avx may take in response and continuing to litigate the rest of the case on september a subsidiary of avx american technical ceramics atc was named as a defendant in a patent infringement case filed in the united states district court of the district of delaware captioned presidio components inc v american technical ceramics corp this case alleges that certain products of atcs infringe on a presidio patent on april the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and found damages to presidio in the amount of million which has been accrued as of march avx is reviewing the verdict and consulting with its legal advisors on what action avx may take in response as of march we had total reserves of million with respect to the two intellectual property cases discussed above the amounts recorded are based on estimated outcomes amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information that becomes available accordingly these costs could differ from our current estimates during the quarter ended september avx was named as a co defendant in a series of cases filed in the united states and in the canadian provinces of quebec ontario and british columbia alleging violations of united states canadian and state antitrust laws asserting that avx and numerous other companies are participants in alleged price fixing in the capacitor market the cases in the united states were consolidated into the northern district of california on october during the quarter ended december additional canadian cases were filed in the provinces of quebec ontario british columbia saskatchewan and manitoba in addition in the quarter ended september avx was named as a co defendant in two cases filed in the united states alleging violations of united states antitrust laws asserting that avx and numerous other companies were participants in alleged price fixing in the resistor market these cases are at the initial stages avx believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend the cases we are involved in other disputes and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business while we cannot predict the outcome of these other proceedings we believe based upon a review with legal counsel that none of these proceedings will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations comprehensive income loss or cash flows however we cannot be certain of the eventual outcome and any adverse result in these or other matters that may arise from time to time may harm our financial position results of operations comprehensive income loss or cash flows disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the company has the following contractual obligations and commitments as of march as noted below fy fy contractual obligations in thousands total fy fy fy thereafter operating leases plant and equipment table above does not include payments related to the settlement of the harbor disclosed above and in note during the fiscal year ended march we made contributions of million to company sponsored retirement savings plans our contributions are partially based on employee contributions as a percentage of their salaries certain contributions by the company are discretionary and are determined by the board of directors each year we expect that our contributions for the fiscal year ending march will be approximately million during the fiscal year ended march we made contributions of million and million to our us and international defined benefit plans respectively contributions are based on a percentage of pensionable wages or requirements necessary to satisfy funding obligations we expect to make contributions of approximately million for our international defined benefit plans for the fiscal year ending march we do not anticipate making contributions to the us plans in fiscal from time to time we enter into delivery contracts with selected suppliers for certain metals used in our production processes the delivery contracts represent routine purchase orders for delivery within three months and payment is due upon receipt as of march we had no material outstanding purchase commitments we have a million liability related to our uncertain tax positions due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities beyond for additional information refer to note critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition warranties inventories pensions income taxes and contingencies management bases its estimates judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis we evaluate our accounting policies and disclosure practices in managements opinion the critical accounting policies and estimates as defined below are more complex in nature and require a higher degree of judgment than the remainder of our accounting policies described in note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein revenue recognition all of our products are built to specification and tested by us or our suppliers for adherence to such specification before shipment to customers we ship products to customers based upon firm orders shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales we recognize revenue when the sales process is complete this occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the terms of an agreement of sale there is a fixed or determinable selling price title and risk of loss have been transferred and collectability is reasonably assured we evaluate gross versus net presentation on revenues from products purchased and resold in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria outlined in fasb asc principal agent considerations based on the evaluation with our resale arrangements with kyocera including consideration of the primary indicators set forth in asc we record revenue related to products purchased and resold on a gross basis estimates used in determining sales allowance programs described below are subject to the volatilities of the market place this includes but is not limited to changes in economic conditions pricing changes product demand inventory levels in the supply chain the effects of technological change and other variables that might result in changes to our estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates returns sales revenue and cost of sales reported in the income statement are reduced to reflect estimated returns we record an estimated sales allowance for returns at the time of sale based on historical trends current pricing and volume information other market specific information and input from sales marketing and other key management personnel the amount accrued reflects the return of value of the customers inventory these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments we believe that these procedures enable us to make reliable estimates of future returns our actual results have historically approximated our estimates when the product is returned and verified the customer is given credit against their accounts receivable distribution programs a portion of our sales are to independent electronic component distributors which are subject to various distributor sales programs we report provisions for distributor allowances in connection with such sales programs as a reduction in revenue and report distributor allowances in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable for the distribution programs described below we do not track the individual units that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories which would allow us to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period nevertheless we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates for each program distributor stock rotation program stock rotation is a program whereby distributors are allowed to return for credit qualified inventory semi annually equal to a certain percentage primarily limited to of the previous six months net sales we record an estimated sales allowance for stock rotation at the time of sale based on a percentage of distributor sales using historical trends current pricing and volume information other market specific information and input from sales marketing and other key management personnel these procedures require the exercise of significant judgment we believe that these procedures enable us to make reliable estimates of future returns under the stock rotation program our actual results have historically approximated our estimates when the product is returned and verified the distributor is given credit against their accounts receivable distributor ship from stock and debit program ship from stock and debit ship and debit is a program designed to assist distributor customers in meeting competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end customers ship and debit programs require a request from the distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part for a sale to the distributors end customer from the distributors stock ship and debit authorizations may cover current and future distributor activity for a specific part for sale to their customer at the time we record sales to the distributors we provide an allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related to such sales since it is probable that such sales to distributors will result in ship and debit activity we record an estimated sales allowance based on sales during the period credits issued to distributors distributor inventory levels historical trends market conditions pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers and input from sales marketing and other key management personnel these procedures require the exercise of significant judgment we believe that these procedures enable us to make reliable estimates of future credits under the ship and debit program our actual results have historically approximated our estimates at the time the distributor ships the part from stock the distributor debits us for the authorized pricing adjustment special incentive programs we may offer special incentive discounts based on amount of product ordered or shipped at the time we record sales under these agreements we provide an allowance for the discounts on the sales for which the customer is eligible to take the customer then debits us for the authorized discount amount inventories we determine the cost of raw materials work in process and finished goods inventories by the first in first out fifo method manufactured inventory costs include material labor and manufacturing overhead inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market net realizable value we value inventory at its market value where there is evidence that the utility of goods will be less than cost and that such write down should occur in the current period accordingly at the end of each period we evaluate our inventory and adjust to net realizable value the carrying value and excess quantities we review and adjust the carrying value of our inventories based on historical usage customer forecasts received from marketing and sales personnel customer backlog certain date code restrictions technology changes demand increases and decreases market directional shifts and obsolescence and aging income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our tax assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within our consolidated balance sheets we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable based on all available evidence both positive and negative to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance we have recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize some of our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable we continue to evaluate countries where we have a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to historical operating losses and when such positive evidence outweighs negative evidence we will release such valuation allowance as appropriate we also record a provision for certain international federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation when needed in the normal course of business we are subject to challenges from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions further during the ordinary course of business other changing facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods we believe that any potential tax exposures have been sufficiently provided for in the consolidated financial statements in the event that actual results differ from these estimates we may need to adjust tax accounts and related payments which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position would more likely than not be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position accruals for estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense we record deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences associated with deductions for foreign branch losses claimed by us in our us income tax returns as these deductions are subject to recapture provisions in the us income tax code when the recapture period expires for these deductions the liabilities are removed and the tax benefit is recognized in the income tax provision pension assumptions pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models two critical assumptions discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement we evaluate these assumptions at least annually the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date to determine the discount rate we apply the expected cash flows from each individual pension plan to specific yield curves at the plans measurement date and determine a level equivalent yield that may be unique to each plan a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets we consider the current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement mortality and turnover these assumptions are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors in such cases the differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are amortized over future periods environmental compliance we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the united states and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate based on our periodic review of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities we believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations regarding sites identified by the epa at which remediation is required our ultimate liability in connection with environmental claims will depend on many factors including our volumetric share of non environmentally safe waste the total cost of remediation and the financial viability of other companies having liability additionally we operate on sites that may have potential future environmental issues as a result of activities at sites during the long history of manufacturing operations by avx or its corporate predecessor or prior to the start of operations by avx even though we may have rights of indemnity for such environmental matters at certain sites regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may require us to address such issues we recognize liabilities for environmental exposures when analysis indicates that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated when a range of loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely the minimum loss in the range is accrued amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional legal and technical information that becomes available the uncertainties about the status of laws regulations regulatory actions technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible aggregate environmental remediation exposure therefore these costs could differ from our current estimates our environmental reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries which are not expected to be significant but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party recent accounting pronouncements in april the fasb issued changes to the criteria for determining which disposals are required to be presented as discontinued operations the changes require a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when any of the following occurs i the component of an entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale ii the component of an entity or group or components of an entity is disposed of by sale or iii the component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of other than by sale the amendments apply on a prospective basis to disposals of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after december and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted the implementation of the amended accounting guidance on january did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in may the fasb issued asu revenue from contracts with customers this guidance modifies the financial reporting of revenue and how an entity will determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the guidance provides for a five step approach in applying the standard identifying the contract with the customer identifying separate performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations and recognizing the revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures for the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue that is being recognized the guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt asu early adoption is not permitted management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements in november the fasb issued asu income taxes this guidance simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes which have previously been split between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly the recording and presentation of deferred income taxes are required to be presented as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december early adoption is permitted and management elected to adopt this guidance prospectively beginning with the interim reporting period ended december the impact on the balance sheet as of march would have been a decrease in current deferred income tax assets of million and an increase in non current deferred income tax assets of million as well as a decrease of current deferred income tax liabilities of million and an increase of non current deferred income tax liabilities of million in february fasb issued asu leases this guidance changes the inclusion of certain right of use assets and the associated lease liabilities to be included in a statement of financial position the classification criteria maintains the distinction between finance leases and operating leases regarding financial leases lessees are required to recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments in the statement of financial position recognize interest on the lease liability separate from the amortization of the right of use asset in the statement of comprehensive income and classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows regarding operating leases lessees are required to recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments in the statement of financial position recognize a single lease cost calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight line basis and classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows this guidance is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december early adoption is permitted management is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or that no material effect is expected on our consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption relationship with kyocera and related transactions kyocera is the majority stockholder of avx as of may kyocera owned beneficially and of record shares of avx common stock representing approximately of our outstanding shares from january through august avx was wholly owned by kyocera on august kyocera sold or shares of avxs common stock and avx sold an additional shares of common stock in a public offering in february kyocera sold an additional shares of its avx common stock our business includes transactions with kyocera such transactions involve the purchase of resale inventories raw materials supplies and equipment the sale of products for resale raw materials supplies and equipment the payment of dividends subcontracting activities and commissions see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for more information on the related party transactions kyocera notified avx in february of its intent effective april to market its connector products in asia using kyoceras sales force rather than continuing to have avx resell such products in asia sales of kyocera connector products in asia were million million and million with operating profit of million million and million for the fiscal years ended march and respectively one principal strategic advantage for avx is our ability to produce a broad product offering to our customers the inclusion of products manufactured by kyocera in that product offering is a significant component of this advantage in addition the exchange of information with kyocera relating to the development and manufacture of multi layer ceramic capacitors and various other ceramic products benefits avx an adverse change in our relationship with kyocera could have a negative impact on our results of operations avx and kyocera have executed several agreements that govern the foregoing transactions and which are described below the special advisory committee of our board comprised of our independent directors currently messrs stach decenzo and christiansen reviews and approves any significant agreements between avx and kyocera and any significant transactions between avx and kyocera not covered by such agreements the committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving any agreements and transactions between avx and any other related party that are or may be within the scope of applicable rules regulations and guidance of the new york stock exchange and item of regulation s k if they arise the special advisory committee operates under a written charter which sets forth the policies and procedures for such approvals in approving any such agreement or transaction pursuant to those procedures the special advisory committee must determine that in its judgment the terms thereof are equivalent to those to which an independent unrelated party would agree at arms length or are otherwise in the best interests of the company and its stockholders generally each of the agreements described below contains provisions requiring that the terms of any transaction under such agreement be equivalent to those to which an independent unrelated party would agree at arms length products supply and distribution agreement pursuant to the products supply and distribution agreement the distribution agreement i avx will act as the non exclusive distributor of certain kyocera manufactured products to certain customers in certain territories outside of japan and ii kyocera will act as the non exclusive distributor of certain avx manufactured products within japan the distribution agreement has a term of one year with automatic one year renewals subject to the right of termination by either party at the end of the then current term upon at least three months prior written notice disclosure and option to license agreement pursuant to the disclosure and option to license agreement the license agreement avx and kyocera exchange confidential information relating to the development and manufacture of multi layered ceramic capacitors and various other ceramic products as well as the license of technologies in certain circumstances the license agreement has a term of one year with automatic one year renewals subject to the right of termination by either party at the end of the then current term upon at least six months prior written notice materials supply agreement pursuant to the materials supply agreement the supply agreement avx and kyocera will from time to time supply the other party with certain raw and semi processed materials used in the manufacture of capacitors and other electronic components the supply agreement has a term of one year with automatic one year renewals subject to the right of termination by either party at the end of the then current term upon at least six months prior written notice machinery and equipment purchase agreement pursuant to the machinery and equipment purchase agreement the machinery purchase agreement avx and kyocera will from time to time design and manufacture for the other party certain equipment and machinery of a proprietary and confidential nature used in the manufacture of capacitors and other electronic components the machinery purchase agreement has a term of one year with automatic one year renewals subject to the right of termination by either party at the end of the then current term upon at least six months prior written notice item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our sales profits and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks we are not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and our reported results of operations could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates international revenues and expenses transacted by our foreign subsidiaries may be denominated in local currency see note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for further discussion of derivative financial instruments for fiscal our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk was estimated using a sensitivity analysis which illustrates a hypothetical change in the average foreign currency exchange rates used during the year actual changes in foreign currency exchange rates may differ from this hypothetical change based on a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the exchange rates assuming no hedging against foreign currency rate changes we would have incurred an additional foreign currency gain or loss of approximately million in fiscal materials we are at risk to fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture our products primarily tantalum palladium platinum silver nickel gold and copper prices for many of these metals have fluctuated significantly during the past year tantalum powder and wire are principal materials used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products the tantalum required to manufacture our products has generally been available in sufficient quantity the limited number of tantalum material suppliers has led to higher prices during periods of increased demand
