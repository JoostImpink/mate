item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsintroduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle wests consolidated financial statements and apss consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see forward looking statements at the front of this report and risk factors in item aoverview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps currently accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings areas of business focus operational performance reliability and recent developments nuclear aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde the march earthquake and tsunamis in japan and the resulting accident at japans fukushima daiichi nuclear power station had a significant impact on nuclear power operators worldwide in the aftermath of the accident the nrc conducted an independent assessment to consider actions to address lessons learned from the fukushima events the independent assessment named the near term task force recommended a number of proposed enhancements to us commercial nuclear power plant equipment and emergency plans the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to begin implementing some of the near term task forces recommendations to implement these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately million for capital enhancements to the plant through in addition to the approximate million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december apss share is coal and related environmental matters and transactions aps is a joint owner of three coal fired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions on june epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the clean power plan and epa finalized its proposal on august epas nationwide co emissions reduction goal is below emission levels as finalized for the state of arizona and the navajo nation compliance with the clean power plan could involve a shift in generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation until implementation plans for these jurisdictions are finalized we are unable to determine the actual impacts to aps aps continually analyzes its long range capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants table of contents chollaon september aps announced that it would close its mw unit at cholla and cease burning coal at units and by the mid s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april the acc approved apss plan to retire unit without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit see note for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the long term than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment aps closed unit on october four corners asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters on december aps purchased sces interest in each of units and of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately million in connection with apss most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december the acc approved rate adjustments related to apss acquisition of sces interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of million on an annual basis on february the acc decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals has suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the sib matter discussed below which could have an effect on the outcome of this four corners proceeding we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolvedconcurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners co owners executed the coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july when the current coal supply agreement expires through el paso a owner in units and of four corners did not sign the coal supply agreement under the coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the shortfall obligation on february aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos interest in each of units and of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july when aps or an affiliate of aps ultimately acquires el pasos interest in four corners ntec has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec on december ntec notified aps of its intent to exercise the option aps is negotiating a definitive purchase agreement with ntec for the purchase of the interest the coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest lease extension aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from to the navajo nation approved these amendments in march the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rights of way grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record table of contents of decision on july the record of decision provided the authority for the bureau of indian affairs to sign the lease amendments and rights of way renewals which occurred in late july on december several environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue with osm and other federal agencies under the endangered species act alleging that osms reliance on the biological opinion and incidental take statement prepared in connection with the environmental review described above were not in accordance with applicable law we are monitoring this matter and will intervene if a lawsuit is filed we cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter natural gas aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona including ocotillo ocotillo is a mw unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older mw steam units adding five mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by mw to mw with completion targeted by summer aps completed a competitive solicitation process in which the ocotillo project was evaluated against other alternatives consistent with the independent monitors report the ocotillo project was selected as the best alternative aps must finalize the permitting process before construction can begintransmission and delivery aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability access to markets and renewable energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity and capital resources section below includes new aps transmission projects through along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long term benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects renewable energy the acc approved the res in the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in the settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to use apss best efforts to obtain gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by year end in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and res target for a component of the res targets development of distributed energy systemsin the acc conducted a hearing to consider apss proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules to establish a process for compliance with the renewable energy requirement that is not based solely on the use of renewable energy credits on september the acc authorized a rulemaking process to modify the res rules the proposed changes would permit the acc to find that utilities have complied with the distributed energy requirement in light of all available information the acc adopted these changes on december the revised rules went into effect on april on july aps filed its res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately million on december the acc issued a decision approving the res implementation plan with minor modifications including reducing the requested budget to approximately milliontable of contents on july aps filed its res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately million on january the acc approved apss plan and requested budget aps has developed owned solar resources through the acc approved az sun program aps has invested approximately million in its az sun program agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid in accordance with the accs decision on the res plan on april aps filed an application with the acc requesting permission to build an additional mw of aps owned utility scale solar under the az sun program in a subsequent filing aps also offered an alternative proposal to replace the mw of utility scale solar with mw approximately customers of aps owned residential solar that will not be under the az sun program on december the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing its residential rooftop solar program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program called the solar partner program is to be mw followed by a mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as make systems available to limited income customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties the acc expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and aps requests cost recovery in a future rate case demand side management in december arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by the figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this standard became effective on january on june aps filed its dsm plan in the standards required aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to of its retail energy sales later in aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for of million on march the acc issued an order approving apss dsm plan the acc approved a budget of million for each of and the acc also approved a resource savings initiative that allows aps to count towards compliance with the acc electric energy efficiency standards savings from improvements to apss transmission and delivery system generation and facilities that have been approved through a dsm plan on march aps filed an application with the acc requesting a budget of million for and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio going forward including for the first time three resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on apss system the acc approved apss dsm budget on november in its decision the acc also approved that verified energy savings from apss resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the electric energy efficiency standard however the acc ruled that aps was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive nor may aps include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its lost fixed cost recovery mechanism on june aps filed its dsm plan requesting a budget of million and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs the dsm plan also proposed a reduction in the dsmac of approximately table of contents electric energy efficiency on june the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency standards should be modified the acc held a series of three workshops in march and april to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning ruleson november the acc staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to arizonas electric utility energy efficiency standards the draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards the acc accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on december a formal rulemaking has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health apss retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc on june aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note for details regarding the settlement agreement terms and for information on apss ferc rateson january aps filed a noi informing the acc that aps intends to submit a rate case application in june using an adjusted test year ending december the noi provides an overview of the key issues aps expects to address in its formal request such as rate design changes residential commercial and industrial a decoupling mechanism permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with the companys ocotillo modernization project permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with environmental standards compliance inclusion of post test year plant and modifications to certain adjustor mechanisms among other items in its rate application aps will request that its proposed pricing changes take effect in july aps is still developing the exact amount of the request aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note as part of apss acquisition of sces interest in units and of four corners aps and sce agreed via a transmission termination agreement that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement transmission agreement between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the arizona transmission system for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination aps and sce negotiated an alternate arrangement under which sce would assign its mw capacity rights over the arizona transmission system to third parties including mw to apss marketing and trading group however this alternative arrangement was not approved by ferc on december aps and sce agreed to terminate the transmission termination agreement and allow for the transmission agreement to expire according to its terms which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the transmission agreement aps has established a regulatory asset of million at december in connection with the expiration of the transmission agreement which it expects to recover through its ferc jurisdictional rates table of contents net metering on july aps filed an application with the acc proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules on december the acc issued its order on apss net metering proposal the acc instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after december the charge of per kilowatt became effective on january and is estimated to collect per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electric grid the fixed charge does not increase apss revenue because it is credited to the lfcrin making its decision the acc determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift causing non solar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electric grid the acc acknowledged that the per kilowatt charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift on october the acc voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the acc on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases a hearing has been scheduled to commence in april aps cannot predict the outcome of this proceedingin arizona jurisdictional utilities uns electric inc and tucson electric power company both filed applications with the acc requesting rate increases these applications include rate design changes to mitigate the cost shift caused by net metering on december aps filed testimony in the uns electric inc rate case in support of the uns electric inc proposed rate design changes aps has also requested intervention in the upcoming tucson electric power company rate case the outcomes of these proceedings will not directly impact our financial positionappellate review of third party regulatory decision system improvement benefits or sib in a recent appellate challenge to an acc rate decision involving a water company the arizona court of appeals considered the question of how the acc should determine the fair value of a utilitys property as specified in the arizona constitution in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors outside of a rate case the court of appeals reversed the accs method of finding fair value in that case and raised questions concerning the relationship between the need for fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors the acc sought review by the arizona supreme court of this decision and aps filed a brief supporting the accs petition to the arizona supreme court for review of the court of appeals decision on february the arizona supreme court granted review of the decision and oral argument is set for march if the decision is upheld by the supreme court without modification certain aps rate adjustors may require modification this could in turn have an impact on apss ability to recover certain costs in between rate cases aps cannot predict the outcome of this matterfinancial strength and flexibility pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings which may include issuances of long term debt and pinnacle west common stock other subsidiariesbright canyon energy on july pinnacle west announced its creation of a wholly owned subsidiary bce bce will focus on new growth opportunities that leverage the companys core expertise in the electric energy industry bces first initiative is a joint venture with bhe us transmission llc a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway energy company the joint venture named transcanyon is pursuing independent transmission opportunities within the eleven states that comprise the western electricity coordinating council excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners utility affiliates transcanyon table of contents continues to pursue transmission development opportunities in the western united states consistent with its strategy el dorado the operations of el dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results or to require any material amounts of capital over the next three yearskey financial drivers in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the companys current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately electric operating revenues for the years through retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices customer and sales growth retail customers in apss service territory increased for the year ended december compared with the prior year for the three years through apss customer growth averaged per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of for through based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased for the year ended december compared with the prior year reflecting the effects of improving economic conditions and customer growth partially offset by customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years through aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of during through including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy could further impact these estimates actual sales growth excluding weather related variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million weather in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data historically extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million however our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million fuel and purchased power costs fuel and

for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our board of directors and based on a number of factors including our financial condition payout ratio free cash flow and other factors our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps and external debt and equity issuances an acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least as defined in the related acc order the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long term debt including current maturities of long term debt at december apss common equity ratio as defined was its total shareholder equity was approximately billion and total capitalization was approximately billion under this order aps would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately billion assuming apss total capitalization remains the same this restriction does not materially affect pinnacle wests ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends

to the extent necessary external debt financing and equity infusions from pinnacle westmany of apss current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation on december president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act hr which combined the tax and government funding bills the protecting americans from tax hikes act and omnibus bill containing an extension of bonus depreciation through enactment of this legislation is expected to generate approximately million of cash tax benefits over the next three years which is expected to be fully realized by aps and pinnacle west consolidated during this time frame the cash generated by the extension of bonus depreciation is an acceleration of the tax benefits that aps would have otherwise received over years at

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved table of contents regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december included in the balance of regulatory assets at december is a regulatory asset of million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings see notes and for more information pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions

statements and apss consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report for information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate see forward looking statements at the front of this report and risk factors in item aoverview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona aps currently accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings areas of business focus operational performance reliability and recent developments nuclear aps operates and is a joint owner of palo verde the march earthquake and tsunamis in japan and the resulting accident at japans fukushima daiichi nuclear power station had a significant impact on nuclear power operators worldwide in the aftermath of the accident the nrc conducted an independent assessment to consider actions to address lessons learned from the fukushima events the independent assessment named the near term task force recommended a number of proposed enhancements to us commercial nuclear power plant equipment and emergency plans the nrc has directed nuclear power plants to begin implementing some of the near term task forces recommendations to implement these recommendations palo verde expects to spend approximately million for capital enhancements to the plant through in addition to the approximate million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of december apss share is coal and related environmental matters and transactions aps is a joint owner of three coal fired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning ghg emissions on june epa proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants the clean power plan and epa finalized its proposal on august epas nationwide co emissions reduction goal is below emission levels as finalized for the state of arizona and the navajo nation compliance with the clean power plan could involve a shift in generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation until implementation plans for these jurisdictions are finalized we are unable to determine the actual impacts to aps aps continually analyzes its long range capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants table of contents chollaon september aps announced that it would close its mw unit at cholla and cease burning coal at units and by the mid s if epa approves a compromise proposal offered by aps to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules on april the acc approved apss plan to retire unit without expressing any view on the future recoverability of apss remaining investment in the unit see note for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and note for details of the proposal aps believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the long term than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment aps closed unit on october four corners asset purchase agreement and coal supply matters on december aps purchased sces interest in each of units and of four corners the final purchase price for the interest was approximately million in connection with apss most recent retail rate case with the acc the acc reserved the right to review the prudence of the four corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction on december the acc approved rate adjustments related to apss acquisition of sces interest in four corners resulting in a revenue increase of million on an annual basis on february the acc decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed aps has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding the arizona court of appeals has suspended the appeal pending the arizona supreme courts decision in the sib matter discussed below which could have an effect on the outcome of this four corners proceeding we cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolvedconcurrently with the closing of the sce transaction bhp billiton the parent company of bncc the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves four corners transferred its ownership of bncc to ntec a company formed by the navajo nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects bhp billiton will be retained by ntec under contract as the mine manager and operator until july also occurring concurrently with the closing the four corners co owners executed the coal supply agreement for the supply of coal to four corners from july when the current coal supply agreement expires through el paso a owner in units and of four corners did not sign the coal supply agreement under the coal supply agreement aps has agreed to assume the shortfall obligation on february aps and el paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps or an affiliate of aps of el pasos interest in each of units and of four corners the cash purchase price which will be subject to certain adjustments at closing is immaterial in amount and the purchaser will assume el pasos reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the interest completion of the purchase is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in july when aps or an affiliate of aps ultimately acquires el pasos interest in four corners ntec has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted by aps to ntec on december ntec notified aps of its intent to exercise the option aps is negotiating a definitive purchase agreement with ntec for the purchase of the interest the coal supply agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the shortfall obligations in the event ntec does not purchase the interest lease extension aps on behalf of the four corners participants negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which extends the four corners leasehold interest from to the navajo nation approved these amendments in march the effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the doi as did a related federal rights of way grant a federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the doi review process and culminated in the issuance by doi of a record table of contents of decision on july the record of decision provided the authority for the bureau of indian affairs to sign the lease amendments and rights of way renewals which occurred in late july on december several environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue with osm and other federal agencies under the endangered species act alleging that osms reliance on the biological opinion and incidental take statement prepared in connection with the environmental review described above were not in accordance with applicable law we are monitoring this matter and will intervene if a lawsuit is filed we cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter natural gas aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona including ocotillo ocotillo is a mw unit gas plant located in the metropolitan phoenix area in early aps announced a project to modernize the plant which involves retiring two older mw steam units adding five mw combustion turbines and maintaining two existing mw combustion turbines in total this increases the capacity of the site by mw to mw with completion targeted by summer aps completed a competitive solicitation process in which the ocotillo project was evaluated against other alternatives consistent with the independent monitors report the ocotillo project was selected as the best alternative aps must finalize the permitting process before construction can begintransmission and delivery aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability access to markets and renewable energy development the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity and capital resources section below includes new aps transmission projects through along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements aps is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long term benefits both to aps and its customers aps is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs minimize system outage durations as well as the number of customers that experience outages and facilitate greater cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects renewable energy the acc approved the res in the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in the settlement agreement aps agreed to exceed the res standards committing to use apss best efforts to obtain gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by year end in addition to its res renewable resource commitments aps met its settlement commitment and res target for a component of the res targets development of distributed energy systemsin the acc conducted a hearing to consider apss proposal to establish compliance with distributed energy requirements by tracking and recording distributed energy rather than acquiring and retiring renewable energy credits on february the acc established a proceeding to modify the renewable energy rules to establish a process for compliance with the renewable energy requirement that is not based solely on the use of renewable energy credits on september the acc authorized a rulemaking process to modify the res rules the proposed changes would permit the acc to find that utilities have complied with the distributed energy requirement in light of all available information the acc adopted these changes on december the revised rules went into effect on april on july aps filed its res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately million on december the acc issued a decision approving the res implementation plan with minor modifications including reducing the requested budget to approximately milliontable of contents on july aps filed its res implementation plan and proposed a res budget of approximately million on january the acc approved apss plan and requested budget aps has developed owned solar resources through the acc approved az sun program aps has invested approximately million in its az sun program agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions including successful siting permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid in accordance with the accs decision on the res plan on april aps filed an application with the acc requesting permission to build an additional mw of aps owned utility scale solar under the az sun program in a subsequent filing aps also offered an alternative proposal to replace the mw of utility scale solar with mw approximately customers of aps owned residential solar that will not be under the az sun program on december the acc voted that it had no objection to aps implementing its residential rooftop solar program the first stage of the residential rooftop solar program called the solar partner program is to be mw followed by a mw second stage that will only be deployed if coupled with distributed storage the program will target specific distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits as well as make systems available to limited income customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties the acc expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and aps requests cost recovery in a future rate case demand side management in december arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy the acc initiated an energy efficiency rulemaking with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by the figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through attributable to energy efficiency initiatives this standard became effective on january on june aps filed its dsm plan in the standards required aps to achieve cumulative energy savings equal to of its retail energy sales later in aps filed a supplement to its plan that included a proposed budget for of million on march the acc issued an order approving apss dsm plan the acc approved a budget of million for each of and the acc also approved a resource savings initiative that allows aps to count towards compliance with the acc electric energy efficiency standards savings from improvements to apss transmission and delivery system generation and facilities that have been approved through a dsm plan on march aps filed an application with the acc requesting a budget of million for and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio going forward including for the first time three resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on apss system the acc approved apss dsm budget on november in its decision the acc also approved that verified energy savings from apss resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the electric energy efficiency standard however the acc ruled that aps was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive nor may aps include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its lost fixed cost recovery mechanism on june aps filed its dsm plan requesting a budget of million and minor modifications to its dsm portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs the dsm plan also proposed a reduction in the dsmac of approximately table of contents electric energy efficiency on june the acc voted to open a new docket investigating whether the electric energy efficiency standards should be modified the acc held a series of three workshops in march and april to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs cost recovery mechanisms incentives and potential changes to the electric energy efficiency and resource planning ruleson november the acc staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to arizonas electric utility energy efficiency standards the draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards the acc accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on december a formal rulemaking has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date rate matters aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health apss retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by ferc on june aps filed a rate case with the acc aps and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the settlement agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case see note for details regarding the settlement agreement terms and for information on apss ferc rateson january aps filed a noi informing the acc that aps intends to submit a rate case application in june using an adjusted test year ending december the noi provides an overview of the key issues aps expects to address in its formal request such as rate design changes residential commercial and industrial a decoupling mechanism permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with the companys ocotillo modernization project permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with environmental standards compliance inclusion of post test year plant and modifications to certain adjustor mechanisms among other items in its rate application aps will request that its proposed pricing changes take effect in july aps is still developing the exact amount of the request aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs these mechanisms are described more fully in note as part of apss acquisition of sces interest in units and of four corners aps and sce agreed via a transmission termination agreement that upon closing of the acquisition the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement transmission agreement between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system the arizona transmission system for sce to transmit its portion of the output from four corners to california aps previously submitted a request to ferc related to this termination which resulted in a ferc order denying rate recovery of million that aps agreed to pay sce associated with the termination aps and sce negotiated an alternate arrangement under which sce would assign its mw capacity rights over the arizona transmission system to third parties including mw to apss marketing and trading group however this alternative arrangement was not approved by ferc on december aps and sce agreed to terminate the transmission termination agreement and allow for the transmission agreement to expire according to its terms which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the transmission agreement aps has established a regulatory asset of million at december in connection with the expiration of the transmission agreement which it expects to recover through its ferc jurisdictional rates table of contents net metering on july aps filed an application with the acc proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules on december the acc issued its order on apss net metering proposal the acc instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after december the charge of per kilowatt became effective on january and is estimated to collect per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electric grid the fixed charge does not increase apss revenue because it is credited to the lfcrin making its decision the acc determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift causing non solar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electric grid the acc acknowledged that the per kilowatt charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift on october the acc voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the acc on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases a hearing has been scheduled to commence in april aps cannot predict the outcome of this proceedingin arizona jurisdictional utilities uns electric inc and tucson electric power company both filed applications with the acc requesting rate increases these applications include rate design changes to mitigate the cost shift caused by net metering on december aps filed testimony in the uns electric inc rate case in support of the uns electric inc proposed rate design changes aps has also requested intervention in the upcoming tucson electric power company rate case the outcomes of these proceedings will not directly impact our financial positionappellate review of third party regulatory decision system improvement benefits or sib in a recent appellate challenge to an acc rate decision involving a water company the arizona court of appeals considered the question of how the acc should determine the fair value of a utilitys property as specified in the arizona constitution in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors outside of a rate case the court of appeals reversed the accs method of finding fair value in that case and raised questions concerning the relationship between the need for fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors the acc sought review by the arizona supreme court of this decision and aps filed a brief supporting the accs petition to the arizona supreme court for review of the court of appeals decision on february the arizona supreme court granted review of the decision and oral argument is set for march if the decision is upheld by the supreme court without modification certain aps rate adjustors may require modification this could in turn have an impact on apss ability to recover certain costs in between rate cases aps cannot predict the outcome of this matterfinancial strength and flexibility pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated

continuing impact of the matters described above many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook including those listed below we closely monitor these factors to plan for the companys current needs and to adjust our expectations financial budgets and forecasts appropriately electric operating revenues for the years through retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline variations in weather from period to period customer mix average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs distributed energy additions electricity rates and tariffs the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions including competition demand and prices customer and sales growth retail customers in apss service territory increased for the year ended december compared with the prior year for the three years through apss customer growth averaged per year we currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of for through based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in arizona retail electricity sales in kwh adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations increased for the year ended december compared with the prior year reflecting the effects of improving economic conditions and customer growth partially offset by customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives for the three years through aps experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations we currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kwh will increase on average in the range of during through including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives but excluding the effects of weather variations a slower recovery of the arizona economy could further impact these estimates actual sales growth excluding weather related variations may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors such as economic conditions customer growth usage patterns and energy conservation impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation and responses to retail price changes based on past experience a reasonable range of variation in our kwh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million weather in forecasting the retail sales

see note this table excludes million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows is uncertain estimated minimum required pension contributions are zero for and see note critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved table of contents regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators such as the acc and ferc to be reflected in our financial statements their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in arizona and is subject to change in the future if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings we had million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december included in the balance of regulatory assets at december is a regulatory asset of million for pension benefits this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings if these costs are disallowed by the acc this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings see notes and for more information pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions

and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use inputs or assumptions that market participants would use to determine fair market value we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value see note for a discussion on accounting policies and note for fair value measurement
